Advantages in enthusiasm and fundraising have Democrats optimistic about their chances, but Republicans have strong economic conditions and a more reliable voter base for turnout.\n\nshow more"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "THIS CARD CHANGES THE BANNER HED AND IMAGE", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/IzFYKVEUPWQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The House of Representatives is still too close to call after an acrimonious midterm election as Democrats seek to win a key check on President Donald Trump's White House. And so far, Republicans are performing strongly in several Senate races though key races remain on a knife edge, reflecting the deep political divide right down the middle of America.\n\nDemocrats have won the first two of the 23 seats they need to seize back the House for the first time in eight years. But Republicans look well positioned to keep the Senate after Marsha Blackburn won one of the key contests in Tennessee, according to a CNN projection.\n\nBut other high-profile contests have yet to be decided.\n\nFlorida is living up to its history as a cliffhanger state, with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson hoping late votes in Democratic counties could narrow his slim deficit to his challenger, the outgoing Gov. Rick Scott. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum is narrowly trailing his challenger Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn Texas, Democrat Beto O'Rourke and incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz are neck-and-neck as votes are counted in Texas and the race remains too early to call.\n\nBut incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly is trailing his Republican challenger in Indiana with more than half the votes counted. The Democrats need to pick up two Senate seats and not lose any to have a majority.\n\nTrump is trying to defy historic omens that suggest that commanders in chief often get a rebuke from voters in the midterm election of their first term. His approval rating -- 39% in the latest CNN poll -- is within the range where the President's party typically suffers heavy losses on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut Trump is such an unusual politician who has made a career overturning conventions and expectations that it's possible he will defy ominous precedents. His connection with his most loyal fans remains so intense that some pundits believe he could help the GOP pull off a surprise.\n\nPreliminary exit poll data found that Trump was a factor for almost two-thirds of House voters. About a quarter supported him and almost 40% said their vote was in opposition to the President. Two-thirds of voters said that they decided how to vote before the last month of the election. Only 1-in-5 decided in the last month and even fewer said they made up their mind in the last few days or the last week.\n\nChange in the air?\n\nIf Democrats do manage to take the House, they will be in position to provide the first institutional check on Trump's presidency -- a role Republicans have chosen not to play given his political dominance on the right.\n\nA loss of the House will also trigger significant second guessing of the President's tactics, given that he chose not to make the booming economy his primary midterm argument, instead turning to a searing indictment of Democrats focusing on immigration and laden with racial language.\n\nTrump is still trusting his feel for what voters want to hear. But if Democrats have a good night, the entire premise of his presidency -- an incessant effort to please his loyal political base, will be called into question. But if Republicans do better than expected, Trump will be able to claim vindication for his campaign strategy and his unconventional approach to the presidency.\n\n\"There's a great electricity in the air, like we haven't seen, in my opinion, since the '16 election. So, something is happening,\" Trump told reporters on Monday, shrugging off suggestions that Democrats had the momentum.\n\nIt would take a disastrous showing for Republicans to lose control of the Senate since most of the endangered lawmakers up for re-election are Democrats from conservative states like Indiana, West Virginia, Montana and North Dakota, where Trump won big two years ago and is still wildly popular.\n\nFor Democrats to have any chance, they need to win at least one of the races in Arizona, Texas or Tennessee, which have not traditionally been favorable to them in recent decades and then virtually run the table in other toss up states.\n\nWaiting for results\n\nThe President planned to have dinner with his family and to watch the results, which could have a profound impact on the rest of his term and could reshape Washington's balance of power, in the residence of the White House.\n\nHe was due to be joined by Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and the President's ex-campaign aides, David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, a source familiar with the guest list said.\n\nTwo other sources close to the White House said that Trump is already blaming retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan for what the President's team is billing as a bad night.\n\n\"He is really angry at Ryan,\" one source said on \"everything.\"\n\nAlongside all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate on the ballot on Tuesday are 36 gubernatorial races. Several have history making potential, especially in Florida where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, is trying to become the state's first African-American governor in an ill-tempered duel with former Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Trump favorite. In an even more bitter contest that has been rocked by race rows and feuds over ballot access, Democrat Stacey Abrams is trying to become the nation's first black female governor in Georgia.\n\nCNN/SSRS poll released Monday showed Democrats with a gaping 55% to 42% lead over Republicans among likely voters in a generic congressional ballot. Trump was badly underwater among women voters -- who favor Democrats 62% to 35% -- a gender gap, that if borne out by real votes, could prove devastating to Republican hopes."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Key GOP wins in Tennessee and Indiana are dashing Democrats' chances of taking the Senate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/x8gCtzCiDx0/h_b57e5abc1cee3357b038b4c398100fde", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:10", "body_paragraphs": "Rep.

Germany claimed the region prior to World War I, but after losing the war the territories were split and \"given\" to the English and French governments.\n\nThe nation that become Cameroon was an awkward amalgamation of those two colonies.\n\nThe current unrest escalated in late 2016 after lawyers, teachers and students went on strike and held street demonstrations about what they said was continued discrimination against Anglophones.\n\nThe strikes and boycotts led to a severe crackdown by police and soldiers, say groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. These groups and local activists say that scores of villages have been burned and civilians killed by the government actions.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said the kidnapping \"may only be the tip of the iceberg.\" The group called on international actors to \"unanimously condemn violence against civilians\" and to \"ensure that this horrific event doesn't become a justification for further abuses by any of the parties to this crisis.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Protests in Cameroon turn deadly Replay More Videos ...

One daughter flew in from California.\n\nMaria Valles de Bonilla said she was fulfilling a dream that she and her late husband shared.\n\nHer family had feared Valles wouldn't make it after suffering two heart attacks in April.\n\nBut Valles was beaming as they wheeled her into the Fairfax office building, wearing her new blue velvet dress.\n\nShe sat in the front row of the ceremony room, her great-granddaughter, 7-year-old Asia, leaning against her wheelchair and giggling as they waited for the event to start.\n\nListening to a message from President Trump\n\nValles looked on attentively as a video of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright began the naturalization ceremony.\n\n\"When I'm asked about the most important event in my life,\" Albright said, \"my answer is becoming an American.\"\n\nBecoming a US citizen had been a dream of Valles' for years.\n\nOriginally from El Salvador, she became a permanent resident of the United States about six years ago, after one of her sons sponsored her. Six of Valles' children live in the United States. Most of them are citizens, too.\n\nWhen she met with a USCIS officer for her citizenship interview, family was on Valles' mind.\n\n\"She told the officer that it was her husband's dream to become a US citizen,\" said Jim McKinney, a spokesman for the agency. \"But unfortunately, he passed away before he could do so, so she is becoming a citizen for both of them.\"\n\nValles holds her naturalization certificate during Tuesday's ceremony.\n\nOn Tuesday, immigrants from about a dozen other countries joined Valles in the Washington district office as she took the oath and covered her heart during the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem.\n\nAn image of the Statue of Liberty with the famous words of poet Emma Lazarus flashed across the screen: \"Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nA video message from President Trump also played.\n\n\"This country is now your country. ... We share one American heart and one American destiny,\" he said.\n\n\"You now share the obligation to teach our values to others,\" he continued, \"to help newcomers assimilate to our way of life.\"\n\nTuesday's ceremony, just miles from the White House, came after days of fierce criticism from Trump about migrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries who are traveling in large groups to seek asylum in the United States\n\nBut Valles and her family weren't dwelling on any messages from Trump.\n\n\"The President says what he thinks is the truth. I always say that American people who God gave the opportunity to be born in this country shouldn't think less of anyone just because of where they were born,\" said Bernarda Bonilla, one of Valles' daughters. \"Every person thinks what he wants, and I respect that. Only God knows the correct response.\"\n\n'Even if you're not that young, you can do it'\n\nValles isn't the oldest person to become a naturalized US citizen. That record belongs to a Turkish immigrant who was 117 when she took the oath in Los Angeles in 1997.\n\nValles receives her certificate as her daughter, Bernarda Bonilla, looks on.\n\nBut McKinney said Valles is the oldest person anyone in the agency's Washington district office can remember naturalizing.\n\n\"Even if you're not that young, you can do it,\" Valles said after Tuesday's ceremony. \"I did it at this age.\"\n\nThe USCIS officer who had interviewed Valles and approved her application attended the ceremony.\n\n\"Buena suerte,\" Immigration Services Officer Felix Zamot told Valles afterward. Good luck.\n\n\"She prays for you every day,\" Valles' granddaughter said.\n\nReady to vote after a 'day of change'\n\nValles -- who was born eight years before women got the right to vote in the United States, and 38 years before women voted for the first time in her native El Salvador -- has never cast a ballot. But she's always been fascinated by watching her children and grandchildren vote in the United States.\n\nEven though she's a US citizen now, Valles wasn't eligible to vote on Tuesday. Virginia's voter registration deadline was in mid-October.\n\nBut her family says that doesn't dampen their enthusiasm, and that having the ceremony on Election Day was particularly meaningful.\n\nValles was joined by her great-grandchildren Asia and Josh Cortes.\n\n\"God's timing is perfect. It was a perfect day. It is a day of change,\" Bonilla said, \"and a day of changing her life.\"\n\nBonilla said Valles' entire family is grateful for every day they spend with her. And hoping that in the future, they'll be able to take her to vote.\n\n\"I would like to one day,\" Valles said, \"if I can.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Pittsburgh polling sites distribute 'Stronger Than Hate' voting stickers", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/el-xNhlJVNM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:23", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Some Pittsburgh polling stations on Tuesday handed out voting stickers that reflected the mood of a grieving and healing city.\n\nPolling places near Tree of Life synagogue, where a gunman killed 11 Jews on October 27 in the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history, distributed the now familiar \"Stronger Than Hate\" stickers featuring a modified version of the Steelers logo, according to Jeanne Clark, chair of the Shadyside Democratic Committee, who said she came up with the idea.\n\nOn the sticker, the yellow star is substituted with the Jewish Star of David.\n\n\"Obviously we've been having a tough time here in Pittsburgh,\" Clark told CNN Tuesday evening. \"I've been trying to figure out how we can support one another.\"\n\nHer answer: Voting stickers honoring the massacre victims.

That threatens Republicans with widespread losses in well-educated, often racially diverse, suburbs in major metropolitan areas around the country, as well as the possible loss of Senate seats in the diverse and growing Southwest states of Nevada, Arizona and possibly (though less likely) Texas.\n\nOn the other side, Trump retains strong support among evangelical, rural and non-college-educated white voters, including women. Trump has energized these voters with a campaign closing argument that appeals to white racial fears and resentments more overtly than any national political figure since George Wallace in the late 1960s.\n\nTrump's efforts are aimed primarily at reinforcing Republican opportunities to oust incumbent Democratic senators in several older, preponderantly white interior states that voted for him in 2016. The high energy among Trump's base is also sustaining long-shot Republican hopes of narrowly holding the House -- or at least minimizing any Democratic majority -- by maintaining the GOP's control of most exurban and blue-collar seats outside the major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe result could be a bifurcated midterm result that simultaneously repudiates Trump while providing him some reaffirmation. While most debate has focused on whether a backlash to Trump will spur a \"wave\" of Democratic gains, today's election seems more likely to solidify and even deepen the stark geographic and demographic divisions that marked Trump's election in 2016. The prospect that turnout will vastly exceed the level in 2014, the most recent midterm election, by perhaps 20 million votes or more, underscores the sense that this campaign may mark a new peak in the partitioning of American society between two political coalitions separated above all by whether they welcome or fear the profound demographic, cultural and economic changes remaking US life.\n\nOn balance, Democrats appear positioned to secure the best results. Beyond the battle for Congress, Democrats are on track for significant gains in governors' races , including in several of the key Rust Belt battlegrounds that keyed Trump's victory. And last-minute polls suggest that if there are surprises in the House and Senate contests, it is more likely to be Democrats prevailing in Trump's terrain than Republicans showing unexpected strength in culturally liberal suburban areas. But the GOP's continued strength among working class and non-urban white voters could allow it to gain Senate seats, and, though much less likely, narrowly defend its House majority.\n\nCoalitions of restoration and transformation\n\nThe election will provide a vivid snapshot of the ongoing polarization of the electorate that Trump has deepened and solidified. Final polling at the national and state level shows Democrats running extremely well among what I've called their \"coalition of transformation\": minorities, millennials and college-educated white voters, especially, but not exclusively, women. All of these groups register intense antipathy for Trump in polls: In the latest CNN survey, conducted by SSRS , Trump's approval rating stood at just 22% among minorities, 32% among young adults and 37% among college-educated whites. That bleak assessment keyed a Democratic advantage in the congressional ballot of 49 percentage points among minorities, 26 points among voters ages 18 to 29 and 22 points among college-educated whites, according to the poll.\n\nOver two-thirds of college-educated white women, an unprecedented number, said they planned to vote Democratic for Congress, according to figures provided by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. Just over half of college-educated white men also preferred Democrats in the survey. That represents a sharp swing from their usual congressional voting behavior: Democrats haven't won even 40% percent of college-educated white men in any congressional election since 2008, according to exit polls.\n\nBut Trump retains substantial loyalty among the competing Republican \"coalition of restoration\" revolving around older, evangelical, rural and blue-collar whites -- the sorts of voters who dominate the mostly small-town and red-state sites where he has held nonstop rallies in recent days.\n\nIn both the CNN survey, and an ABC/Washington Post survey released Sunday, Trump's approval rating among non-college whites stood at 56%. That represents an erosion from his 2016 vote among them, according to exit polls (67%) but it is still enough to provide Republicans big leads over Democrats with those voters in these surveys. The CNN poll shows non-college whites preferring Republicans for Congress by a 20-percentage-point margin, while the NBC/WSJ survey also released Sunday showed them with a 24-point advantage and the ABC/WP put their lead at 25 points.\n\nIn a mirror image to the well-educated women, nearly two-thirds of white men without a college education said they planned to vote Republican in the CNN poll. Non-college white women also preferred Republicans in the CNN survey, albeit by a much slimmer 53% to 45%; that would be the best showing for Democrats in congressional races since 2006, but might still leave them scrambling to build a winning coalition in House and Senate races dominated by working-class whites.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH officials warn Trump to brace for GOP losses in House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH officials warn Trump to brace for GOP losses in House 03:45\n\nThe Democratic strength with the \"coalition of transformation\" positions the party for significant gains in suburban districts outside the South where large numbers of ordinarily Republican-leaning college-educated voters dislike or even disdain Trump. This recoil virtually guarantees substantial Republican losses in well-educated House districts the party now holds in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Northern Virginia and Miami in the East; Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City and Minneapolis in the Midwest; and Denver, Tucson, Orange County, California, and probably Seattle in the West. That geography underscores the irony that House Republicans today face their greatest risk in the places that are doing best in the economy -- but where large numbers of voters reject Trump's values and behavior.\n\nFor Republicans to have any chance of preserving their House majority -- or even to hold down a potential Democratic majority to a level that maintains a reasonable chance of the GOP recapturing control in 2020 -- the party needs to minimize its losses beyond those places. The reverse is true too: Unless Democrats can expand beyond the epicenter of Republican vulnerability in the white-collar suburbs outside the South (especially the Republican-held districts that voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016) they will be operating with little margin for error in their drive to recapture 23 seats and the House majority.\n\nRepublicans need a firewall\n\nThat means one key question is whether Republicans can build a firewall around two other groups of districts. One is white-collar suburbs in the South. Traditionally Southern suburbanites have embraced much more conservative positions (especially on social issues) than their counterparts in other regions. But this year Democrats are mounting serious challenges for suburban seats near Raleigh, North Carolina; Atlanta; Houston; Dallas; Tampa, Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia. Republicans can't afford to lose many of those.\n\nLikewise, the GOP can't afford many losses in blue-collar and exurban districts outside the South that are dominated by the key groups in the \"coalition of restoration.\" Top-tier Democratic targets fitting that description include seats in Maine, upstate New York, northeastern Iowa and central and northwestern Pennsylvania that have drawn increasing attention in the campaign's final turn. One especially revealing group of seats may be those that sit at the intersection of the parties' competing coalitions: places like the districts near Pittsburgh; Seattle; Des Moines, Iowa; Lexington, Kentucky; and Charlotte, North Carolina, that combine suburban with rural populations. The results in those seats will measure the relative enthusiasm of the suburban coalition mobilizing against Trump and the small-town and rural coalition rallying to his defense.\n\nTrump is dividing the country but solidifying his base\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump on racist campaign ad: 'Just telling the truth' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on racist campaign ad: 'Just telling the truth' 01:01\n\nTrump's embrace of such a racially polarizing final message can be interpreted as a form of triage in the House. Almost all Republican consultants agree he is compounding the problems for the GOP incumbents trying to survive in the suburban seats at greatest risk. But he may also be fortifying Republican defenses in the blue-collar, exurban and small-town seats beyond that inner circle of vulnerability. Put another way, Trump's divisive close may be reducing the odds that Democrats win 45 seats in the House -- but at the price of increasing the odds that they win the 23 they need to recapture the majority.\n\nTrump's open appeals to racial anxieties and xenophobia are intended above all to boost Republican prospects against nine Democratic senators seeking re-election in preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar and older interior states that he carried in 2016. (A 10th Democratic senator, Bill Nelson, is seeking re-election in Florida, a much more diverse state that Trump also carried.)\n\nFour of those states across the industrial Rust Belt have essentially moved off the board for Republicans, with Democratic incumbent Sens. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow in Michigan and Bob Casey in Pennsylvania all holding commanding leads. (Democrats also have an opportunity to win the governorship in each of those states, as well as Iowa.)\n\nBut Republicans are considered solid favorites to beat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and have mounted strong challenges to Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana, though late polls give each Democrat reasons for optimism. Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia appears the best positioned of these remaining Trump-state Democrats to survive, but Sen. Jon Tester in Montana remains a wild card amid conflicting polls in the campaign's final days.\n\nIn both the House and Senate, the strong emotions surrounding Trump appear likely to accelerate the transformation of congressional races into quasi-parliamentary contests in which individual assessments of the two candidates are overshadowed by broader judgments about the President and the two parties.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the relationship has grown stronger between how voters grade the sitting president and whether they support his party's candidates in House races. But 2018 may push that trajectory to a new peak. In the past three midterms (2006, 2010 and 2014) between 82% and 84% of voters who disapproved of the president's performance voted against his party's candidates in House races, while 84% to 87% of those who approved voted for them, exit polls found. In the new CNN survey, 91% of Trump approvers said they planned to vote Republican while 92% of disapprovers said they intended to vote Democratic; in the ABC/WP survey the numbers were just under 9 in 10.\n\nRed states and blue states\n\nJUST WATCHED These 2 things could hold back Dems in Arizona Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These 2 things could hold back Dems in Arizona 03:35\n\nBy historic standards, the number of representatives in districts that voted for the other party's presidential candidates is already very low: Just 25 Republicans are in districts that preferred Clinton and only 12 Democrats hold seats in districts that backed Trump. At least two-thirds of the Republicans in Clinton districts are in serious jeopardy today, which means that the number of GOP members from such seats could fall into single digits after the election. Republicans, in turn, have at least some chance of dislodging about one-third of the Democrats in Trump districts, though Democrats today also have opportunities to offset that by capturing over a dozen districts that Trump won. Still, the number of House districts that \"split their ticket\" between the presidential and congressional votes will likely remain very low by historic standards, and could even shrink further.\n\nThe Senate could see the same pattern. Already it's grown much more difficult for senators to win in states that usually vote the other way in presidential elections. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who faces re-election in 2020, for instance, is the only Republican left among the 30 senators elected in the 15 states that have voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992.\n\nThis election could further cull the already diminished ranks of Democratic senators in red-leaning terrain:\n\n13 states have voted Republican in all seven presidential elections since 1992. Democrats hold just two of their 26 Senate seats and are at high risk of losing one of them, Heitkamp's seat in North Dakota. (They could replace that seat if Beto O'Rourke upsets Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, which has also voted Republican in each of the past seven presidential races.)\n\nDemocrats hold just two of their 26 Senate seats and are at high risk of losing one of them, Heitkamp's seat in North Dakota. (They could replace that seat if Beto O'Rourke upsets Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, which has also voted Republican in each of the past seven presidential races.) 5 states have voted Republican in six of the past seven presidential elections.

(Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, which has also voted Republican five of seven, could replace one of them.)\n\nDemocrats hold only two of their 12 seats. Manchin and especially McCaskill both face tough races. (Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, which has also voted Republican five of seven, could replace one of them.) 2 states have voted Republican in four of the past seven elections. Democrats hold three of their four Senate seats, but Nelson is in a tough race to hold one of those in Florida.\n\nIn all, Republicans already hold 43 of the 52 Senate seats in the 26 states they have carried in at least four of the seven presidential elections since 1992. If Democrats have a bad night, Republicans could emerge with more than 45 of those seats.\n\nBy contrast, with their Rust Belt recovery, Democrats do not appear at serious risk of losing any the 40 Senate seats they now hold in the 24 states they have won in at least four of the past seven presidential elections. They have a good chance even of adding one, in Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is pressing Republican Sen. Dean Heller.\n\nAll of these dynamics point to the same bracing conclusion: This election is likely to intensify the realignment of the nation into two distinct blocks with inimical visions not only of Trump's belligerent presidency but also of the underlying social, racial and economic changes remaking American life.\n\nAcross the country, Democrats appear on track to consolidate their control of House seats in metropolitan areas that are more diverse, younger, secular and connected to the information age and global economy. (Only the South might resist that pattern.) But they may do little to dent the Republican dominance in non-metro areas that are predominantly white, older, heavily Christian and grounded in traditional industries of manufacturing, energy and agriculture. (The Midwest offers Democrats the best chances to make such inroads.) In the Senate, Democrats could gain ground in younger diverse Sun Belt states (Nevada and/or Arizona, conceivably Texas) and simultaneously lose ground in older, mostly white interior states (North Dakota and the others).\n\nIn both the House and Senate, each party's caucus may be tilted even more than it is today toward one side of this divide.\n\nThe result is that on Wednesday morning, the distance and discord between the coalitions of transformation and restoration may be more vividly apparent than ever. What's less clear is whether America can find any political common ground, or even maintain its social cohesion, as that fault line grows more jagged and volatile."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Election 2018: Control of House too close to call, GOP wins key Senate seat", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/IzFYKVEUPWQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:27", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The House of Representatives is still too close to call after an acrimonious midterm election as Democrats seek to win a key check on President Donald Trump's White House. And so far, Republicans are performing strongly in several Senate races though key races remain on a knife edge, reflecting the deep political divide right down the middle of America.\n\nDemocrats have won the first two of the 23 seats they need to seize back the House for the first time in eight years. But Republicans look well positioned to keep the Senate after Marsha Blackburn won one of the key contests in Tennessee, according to a CNN projection.\n\nBut other high-profile contests have yet to be decided.\n\nFlorida is living up to its history as a cliffhanger state, with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson hoping late votes in Democratic counties could narrow his slim deficit to his challenger, the outgoing Gov. Rick Scott. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum is narrowly trailing his challenger Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn Texas, Democrat Beto O'Rourke and incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz are neck-and-neck as votes are counted in Texas and the race remains too early to call.\n\nBut incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly is trailing his Republican challenger in Indiana with more than half the votes counted. The Democrats need to pick up two Senate seats and not lose any to have a majority.\n\nTrump is trying to defy historic omens that suggest that commanders in chief often get a rebuke from voters in the midterm election of their first term. His approval rating -- 39% in the latest CNN poll -- is within the range where the President's party typically suffers heavy losses on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut Trump is such an unusual politician who has made a career overturning conventions and expectations that it's possible he will defy ominous precedents. His connection with his most loyal fans remains so intense that some pundits believe he could help the GOP pull off a surprise.\n\nPreliminary exit poll data found that Trump was a factor for almost two-thirds of House voters. About a quarter supported him and almost 40% said their vote was in opposition to the President. Two-thirds of voters said that they decided how to vote before the last month of the election. Only 1-in-5 decided in the last month and even fewer said they made up their mind in the last few days or the last week.\n\nChange in the air?\n\nIf Democrats do manage to take the House, they will be in position to provide the first institutional check on Trump's presidency -- a role Republicans have chosen not to play given his political dominance on the right.\n\nA loss of the House will also trigger significant second guessing of the President's tactics, given that he chose not to make the booming economy his primary midterm argument, instead turning to a searing indictment of Democrats focusing on immigration and laden with racial language.\n\nTrump is still trusting his feel for what voters want to hear. But if Democrats have a good night, the entire premise of his presidency -- an incessant effort to please his loyal political base, will be called into question. But if Republicans do better than expected, Trump will be able to claim vindication for his campaign strategy and his unconventional approach to the presidency.\n\n\"There's a great electricity in the air, like we haven't seen, in my opinion, since the '16 election. So, something is happening,\" Trump told reporters on Monday, shrugging off suggestions that Democrats had the momentum.\n\nIt would take a disastrous showing for Republicans to lose control of the Senate since most of the endangered lawmakers up for re-election are Democrats from conservative states like Indiana, West Virginia, Montana and North Dakota, where Trump won big two years ago and is still wildly popular.\n\nFor Democrats to have any chance, they need to win at least one of the races in Arizona, Texas or Tennessee, which have not traditionally been favorable to them in recent decades and then virtually run the table in other toss up states.\n\nWaiting for results\n\nThe President planned to have dinner with his family and to watch the results, which could have a profound impact on the rest of his term and could reshape Washington's balance of power, in the residence of the White House.\n\nHe was due to be joined by Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and the President's ex-campaign aides, David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, a source familiar with the guest list said.\n\nTwo other sources close to the White House said that Trump is already blaming retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan for what the President's team is billing as a bad night.\n\n\"He is really angry at Ryan,\" one source said on \"everything.\"\n\nAlongside all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate on the ballot on Tuesday are 36 gubernatorial races. Several have history making potential, especially in Florida where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, is trying to become the state's first African-American governor in an ill-tempered duel with former Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Trump favorite. In an even more bitter contest that has been rocked by race rows and feuds over ballot access, Democrat Stacey Abrams is trying to become the nation's first black female governor in Georgia.\n\nCNN/SSRS poll released Monday showed Democrats with a gaping 55% to 42% lead over Republicans among likely voters in a generic congressional ballot. Trump was badly underwater among women voters -- who favor Democrats 62% to 35% -- a gender gap, that if borne out by real votes, could prove devastating to Republican hopes."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Exit polls: This election is about Donald Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/f5nfoZlbiyY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:28", "body_paragraphs": "Below is early analysis of CNN's 2018 national exit polls.\n\nPreliminary CNN exit polls show voters between the ages of 18-29 reported supporting a Democratic candidate in the race for the House in higher numbers than in 2014. In the last midterm election, 54% of 18-29-year-olds voted Democratic while more than two-thirds said they voted for the Democrat so far in 2018.\n\nWhile all age groups have supported a Democratic candidate in higher numbers than the previous midterm election, according to the early exit polling, the jump among the youngest voters is around 14 percentage points while those in other age groups moved up less than 10 percentage points.\n\n9:24 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMost say Russia investigation is politically motivated\n\nSlightly over half of voters in the 2018 election said that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is politically motivated, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll. Around 40% said that it's a justified investigation. President Donald Trump often refers to the investigation as a smear campaign and \"witch hunt.\"\n\nAround the same number who think the investigation is justified, about 40%, approve of the job Robert Mueller is doing handling the investigation, while slightly more disapprove of his job.\n\n8:14 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nAmericans more worried about voters being blocked from casting ballots\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of voter fraud, warning as recently as Monday that law enforcement will be watching closely for any illegal voting.\n\n\"Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday's Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThat's not in step with what worries Americans, however. More than half of voters said they were more concerned that people who should be able to vote will be prevented from doing so, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nJust over a third said they were more concerned that people who shouldn't be able to vote will cast ballots.\n\nPrecincts in a multitude of states extended hours today because of voting issues.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign interference, half of voters said they don't think the government has done enough to protect this election, while just over one-third said enough has been done.\n\n8:08 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoters didn't support Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court\n\nAlmost half of voters opposed Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to preliminary data from CNN's national exit polls. A little over 40% supported his appointment. Around half of men supported Kavanaugh's confirmation compared to fewer than 40% of women who voted in this election, a significant gender divide.\n\nOn Roe v. Wade, two-thirds of 2018 voters said they would like to keep the landmark Supreme Court decision in place while only a quarter want it overturned. More than 80% said that sexual harassment is a very or somewhat serious problem in our country today and almost half said it's very serious.\n\n7:43 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nHigher support for Trump in some key states\n\nIn Indiana, around half of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as President around the same as in Missouri, slightly higher than the nationwide average. Both states feature tight Senate races where Democrats are trying to hold on to seats in states Trump won in 2016.\n\nVoters in Indiana and Missouri are split between whether their vote for Senate was in support of the President, opposition, or whether Trump isn't a factor in their vote. Around a third in both states said that their Senate vote was in opposition to Trump while around three-in-ten said it was in support of him or Trump wasn't a factor.\n\n7:38 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMixed views of Trump's agenda\n\nThe election was very much about President Donald Trump, as many voters cast their ballot specifically to oppose or support him. Similarly, reviews of his agenda and his accomplishments were mixed. About half of voters said that Trump's immigration policies are too tough, while around a third think they're just right and few, only about 15%, think he's not tough enough, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit polls.\n\nThe tax law passed by Republicans and touted by Trump hasn't had a lot of impact on American voters' personal finances, according to the poll. Close to half say they've seen no impact, while around three-in-10 said the law has helped and a quarter report the tax law has hurt them.\n\nFor his trade policies, which include new tariffs imposed on foreign countries and an update to NAFTA, about a third say they've had no impact on the economy in their area, but about 30% said that his trade policies have hurt them. A quarter indicate that his trade policies have helped their area's economy.\n\n6:34 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nExtremist violence was a factor in many votes in 2018\n\nAround three-quarters said that extremist violence is an important factor in their vote for the US House in 2018, according to preliminary CNN exit data, with a quarter who said it's the most important factor and half who said it's an important factor. Few said that extremist violence is a minor or not a factor to their vote.\n\nAnother three-quarters of 2018 voters said that Americans are becoming more divided politically. Fewer than one-in-10 think the country is becoming more united, and slightly more say the country is staying about the same.\n\n6:20 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nVoters want more women and racial minorities elected to public office\n\nAlmost 80% of voters said that it's very or somewhat important that more women be elected to public office and almost half said it's very important. Slightly more women than men placed a priority on electing more women to public office, but not by much.\n\nSlightly fewer but around seven-in-ten said that it's very or somewhat important for racial and ethnic minorities to be elected to public office. Around two-thirds of white voters said it's important to elect more minorities while around 80% of African Americans agreed.\n\n6:17 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMost voters, particularly Democratic voters, want major changes in health care\n\nIt's no surprise that health care was the top issue for most voters. Roughly four in 10 voters listed it as their top concern, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nThis was especially true among Democrats.\n\nWhat is more surprising is that roughly seven in 10 voters said they wanted major changes to the nation's health care system, with more Democrats feeling this way than Republicans. Among voters who felt that health care needs minor, more were Republicans. More Democrats wanted no changes.\n\nThis is a huge swing from two years ago, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans saw their big wins at the polls as a mandate to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort ultimately failed, though the Trump administration continues to undermine the landmark health reform law through regulatory changes.\n\nThis election, however, revolved around retaining Obamacare's key provisions that protect those with pre-existing conditions. Democratic candidates repeatedly attacked their Republican rivals as jeopardizing the health insurance of millions of Americans who are or have been sick. The popularity of these Obamacare protections forced Republican candidates to promise to uphold these measures.\n\nMany voters weren't convinced. More than half said Democrats would better protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions, while only one-third said Republicans would.\n\n6:03 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect it was more Republicans and not a majority of Republicans who support minor changes and more Democrats support no changes to the health care law.\n\nNancy Pelosi more unpopular than Donald Trump\n\nThe Democratic Party has slightly higher favorability than the Republican Party in preliminary data from CNN's national exit poll. About half of voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party, while the Republican Party is upside down, with slightly more than 40% saying they had a positive view of the Republicans.\n\nThe downside for Democrats is an extremely low favorable rating for Nancy Pelosi, the woman who would like to again be Speaker of the House if Democrats win control of the House of Representatives. Only about three-in-10 voters had a positive view of Pelosi and more than half had an unfavorable view. In fact, more voters had an unfavorable view of Pelosi than had an unfavorable view of President Trump, according to preliminary results.\n\n-- 5:56 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMost voters feel good or great about the economy\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted how good the economy is doing under his watch.\n\nMany voters agreed. More than two-thirds said the economy is excellent or good, though Republicans were much more likely to feel that way, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nJust under a third of voters said the economy is not good or poor, and bof them were Democrats.\n\nThe economy, however, was not the key issue for many voters this midterm election. It ranked third, behind health care and immigration but well ahead of gun policy. The economy mattered more to Republicans than Democrats.\n\nNearly half of voters felt their financial situation is the same as it was two years ago. Just over a third said it was better, while a little less than 15% said it was worse.\n\nRepublicans were initially running on the tax cut package they passed at the end of 2017, though that fervor faded as the midterms approached. Voters were more muted about the tax cuts' effect on their lives. Nearly half said it had no impact, while just under a quarter said it hurt them. Just over a quarter said they were helped by the tax cuts.\n\n-- 5:50 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nCorrection: The percentage of Democrats saying the economy was not good or poor has been corrected.\n\nVoters decided a long time ago\n\nA big majority of voters, about two-thirds, made their 2018 election decision before the last month, according to preliminary exit poll results. Only one-in-five said they decided in the last month and even fewer said they made up their minds in the last few days or last week.\n\nAbout four-in-five have voted in a midterm election before, but about 15% said that this is the first time they've voted in a midterm. About 10% said they were first-time voters in the 2016 election.\n\n5:34 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMore voted opposing Trump than supporting him\n\nMore than 40% of voters in the 2018 election approve of the job Trump is doing as President, according to the preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll. About three-in-10 said they strongly approve of Trump while almost half said they strongly disapprove of him.\n\nAlmost two-thirds said that Trump was a factor in their vote for the House today. About a quarter said their vote was in support of the President and almost 40% said that their vote was in opposition to him.\n\nA majority, a little more than half, said things in the country are on the wrong track. About 40% say they're going in the right direction.\n\n5:20 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nThis election is about Donald Trump\n\nTwo-thirds of voters say their vote in today's congressional election is about Donald Trump, according to early exit polls, and more say they're showing up at the polls to express opposition than support for the President. The President's approval rating is net negative among the nation's voters, and more say things in the country are on the wrong track than that they are going in the right direction. Still, nearly 7 in 10 say the economy is in good shape, and those who say their personal finances are in better shape now than two years ago outnumber those who feel their finances have worsened.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 voters turning out to vote across the country choose health care as the most important problem facing the country, and more, 7 in 10, say the nation's health care system needs major changes. About 2 in 10 each choose the economy and immigration as their top issue, and 1 in 10 say it's gun policy.\n\nWith a historically diverse slate of candidates on ballots nationwide, about half of voters say it's very important to them that more women are elected to public office and that more racial and ethnic minorities are elected.\n\nA sizeable 1 in 6 voters say this election is the first time they're casting a ballot in a midterm contest.\n\n-- 5 p.m. ET / Jennifer Agiesta"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Election night viewers' guide: How the midterms will unfold, hour by hour", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/fmrDj2JHzZ8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:29", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) It could take a few hours -- or a few weeks -- to sort out who wins control of Congress after Tuesday's midterm elections .\n\nBut while results are flying in from all over the country beginning at 6 p.m. ET, we'll see indicators of whether Democrats will achieve the net gain of 23 seats they need to control the House , whether the GOP's two-seat Senate majority will grow or shrink and how key governors' races will shape up.\n\nWe tried to make it as easy as possible to keep track of it all. Here's an in-depth, hour-by-hour look at what to watch, and where:\n\nThe first polls close (6 p.m. ET)\n\nPolls close at 6 p.m. ET in most of Indiana and Kentucky . Parts of both states are in the Central time zone, so it'll take time to see whether Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly survives a challenge from Republican businessman Mike Braun.\n\nThe one we'll all be talking about first: Kentucky's 6th District. Amy McGrath, a former combat pilot, is challenging Republican Rep. Andy Barr.\n\nIt might not be a great national bellwether. In an unusual twist -- in part due to the brutal ads Barr has aired -- the race has largely become about McGrath and whether she is too progressive for the district, rather than a referendum on Trump or the incumbent congressman. But it will be an early indicator of the environment, and a Barr loss would give Republicans reason to panic.\n\nExpect to see McGrath up early as the city of Lexington's results come in first -- but the margin is likely to tighten up quickly.\n\nThe early indicators (7-7:30 p.m. ET)\n\nDemocrats saw one more district in Virginia emerge as competitive late in the cycle: the 5th District, where former journalist Leslie Cockburn takes on Republican Denver Riggleman, an Air Force veteran and distillery owner. A Democratic win here would be a sign of a tidal wave threatening to wipe out Republicans whose races weren't even on the national radar.\n\nThe Atlanta suburbs feature two wave-maker districts -- if Democrats win either, it'd mean they're in for a big night. In Georgia's 6th District, Republican Rep. Karen Handel -- who won a ballyhooed special election against Jon Ossoff last year -- faces Lucy McBath, a challenger whose unarmed son was shot and killed over a dispute about loud music . And in the 7th District, Republicans are furious that Rep. Rob Woodall never took his race seriously. \"If you don't think it behooves you to put paid media on air, we're not going to come help you. We're not a welfare organization,\" a Republican official said.\n\nAlso keep your eye on a few wave-makers in Florida . The Tampa-area 15th District is an open seat that emerged as competitive late -- so late, in fact, that Republicans couldn't afford a rescue effort. On the Atlantic coast side, the 6th District's open-seat contest for former Rep. Ron DeSantis' old seat is another potential Democratic pick-up that would suggest the party is soaring past the 23 seats it needs for a House majority. If either of Republican Reps. Brian Mast or Vern Buchanan lose, it's another sign that Democrats are on the path to winning the House.\n\nHistory-makers. In In Georgia , the headliner is the governor's race between Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams, an emerging Democratic star who has combined a progressive platform with an appeal to black voters -- all with a chance to become the nation's first black female governor . If neither candidate tops 50%, the race will head to a runoff.\n\nIn Florida , a small portion of the panhandle is in Central time, so we'll need to wait an extra hour for full results to come in for the governor's race between Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a progressive favorite, and DeSantis, who has aligned himself so closely with Trump that this is a potential preview of 2020.\n\nDemocrats' Senate must-wins. The The Florida Senate contest, with Republican Gov. Rick Scott challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, is one of the nation's most expensive and closely watched -- and if Nelson loses, it would severely diminish Democrats' shot at a majority.\n\nA Midwestern state-level resurgence?

The two major battlegrounds are Pennsylvania and New Jersey\n\nIn Pennsylvania , where the state Supreme Court made a mid-year decision to redraw the state's congressional district lines, Democrats look likely to pick up four seats -- the open 5th, 6th and 7th districts around Philadelphia, and the 17th District, where Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb and Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus were drawn together into the same suburban Pittsburgh race. One to watch as a sign of a Democratic wave: Whether Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents Philadelphia's northern suburbs, holds on. If Republican Reps. Scott Perry (10th District) or Mike Kelly (16th District) start to sweat, it's a disaster for the GOP.\n\nIn New Jersey , Democrats need to win at least two races with two of their strongest recruits of the cycle: the open 2nd District, where conservative Democratic state Sen. Jeff Van Drew is the heavy favorite, and the 11th District, with Mikie Sherrill.\n\nBut it's the next two that would clearly show Democrats on their way to a huge House majority: Republican incumbents Leonard Lance and Tom MacArthur, one of the architects of the House's health care repeal bill who also backed Trump's tax bill, are also in the fights of their political lives. If MacArthur loses, it'd show how potent health care is as an issue for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats could also pick off House seats in Illinois . Sean Casten is their best bet -- he faces GOP Rep. Peter Roskam in the Chicago suburbs. Also near Chicago, Rep. Randy Hultgren faces a stiff challenge from Lauren Underwood, who campaigned with former President Barack Obama over the weekend. The 12th and 13th Districts are two more wave-maker types with GOP incumbents Mike Bost and Rodney Davis.\n\nMore key races to watch this hour:\n\n-- Maine's 2nd District : Can Rep. Bruce Poliquin stave off Democratic challenger Jared Golden?\n\n-- Mississippi Senate : Does Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith hold off conservative Chris McDaniel and advance to a one-on-one runoff against Democratic former Rep. Mike Espy?\n\nThe majority makers (9 p.m. ET)\n\nSuburban revolt? A slew of House seats are up for grabs in the 9 p.m. ET poll closings and, depending on which way states early in the night tilt, a Democratic House majority could come together based on poll closings in Texas, A slew of House seats are up for grabs in the 9 p.m. ET poll closings and, depending on which way states early in the night tilt, a Democratic House majority could come together based on poll closings in Colorado Minnesota and a dozen more states.\n\nAll eyes will be on Minnesota , where Democrats are now poised to turn the state blue two years after it came close to going for Trump in 2016. Democrats appear likely to hold the state's two Senate seats and the governor's mansion, but four closely watched House contests, including two where Democrats are on defense, will indicate how successful Democrats are in breaking down Trump's red wall.\n\nThe big question: Will either party gain House seats in Minnesota , or will it be a wash?\n\nDemocrats are confident in Minnesota's 2nd and 3rd Districts -- where Democrats Angie Craig and Dean Phillips are running against embattled Republican incumbents -- and Republicans have largely written off the two races. But Republican Jim Hagedorn in southern Minnesota and Pete Stauber in the northern reaches of the state are both on offense and party operatives are hopeful they can be two bright stops in what could otherwise be a tough night.\n\nThe poll closing at 9 p.m. ET could also cement 2018 as the year of the suburban revolt against Republicans. Republicans have all but written off Kansas' 3rd and Colorado's 6th districts, both suburban seats currently held by Republicans, but Democratic wins in suburban Dallas with Colin Allred, Houston with Lizzie Fletcher and Detroit with Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens could cement House majorities for Democrats.\n\nHistory in Texas? Texas hasn't elected a state-wide Democrat since 1988. But Rep. Beto O'Rourke, fueled by Democratic enthusiasm and a Brinks Truck worth of cash, has given Sen. Ted Cruz a real race. Polls have the upstart Democrat down and Republicans believe the state's Republican tendencies will be evident on Election Day, but staggeringly high early voting numbers and national attention on the race have given O'Rourke a chance. A win here would be earth-shattering for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats hope that a loss in North Dakota (or earlier in the night) could be erased by a win in Arizona , where two congresswomen -- Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally -- are fighting in a state Trump won in 2016.\n\nThe race has become a judgment on Walker, who is asking voters for a third term in the state, an ask that even Republicans admit makes his re-election difficult.\n\nThe dark horse gubernatorial race of the 9 p.m. ET hour is in South Dakota , where Republican Rep. Kristi Noem is in a surprisingly tough fight against Democrat Billie Sutton, an anti-abortion, pro-gun Democrat who is running to oversee a state that backed Trump by 30 percentage points in 2016.\n\nPut the coffee on (10 p.m. ET and later)\n\nEyeing Orange County. If control of the House comes down to these hours, it's time to make more coffee.\n\nPolls will close on competitive House races in Iowa Nevada and Washington state in this two-hour span -- all states where Democrats believe it is likely they will pick up seats -- but the biggest prize of these late-night hours comes from California , where at least nine House races up and down the state are worth watching.\n\nAn important note: If Democratic control of the House comes down to California, the country is in for a long ordeal. California is notoriously slow at counting votes, meaning races could be decided in days and weeks, not hours.\n\nWhile Democrats are fighting in competitive races throughout California's Central Valley -- where Democrats Josh Harder and T.J. Cox are looking to oust Republicans in districts Clinton won two years ago -- the bulk of Democratic focus will be on Southern California, namely the Los Angeles and Orange County area.\n\nKatie Hill, Gil Cisneros, Katie Porter, Harley Rouda and Mike Levin are the five Democrats looking to flip seats in the traditionally Republican area. Depending on how races earlier in the night go, these five seats in Southern California could either be the cherry on top of a good night for Democrats or the focus of considerable attention over the next weeks.\n\nNevada and Montana Senate contests. The most hotly contested races, though, are in The most hotly contested races, though, are in Montana , where Democrat Jon Tester is looking to hold onto his seat against Republican Matt Rosendale, and Nevada , where Democrat Jacky Rosen is on offense against Republican incumbent Dean Heller.\n\nDemocrats expect to hold Montana, where Tester is running on his connections to the state and authenticity , but Nevada is expected to be a fight, despite that fact that Heller for months has been seen as the most vulnerable Republican incumbent running for Senate this year.\n\nGovernors' races wrap with a late night in Alaska. Democrats are looking to flip gubernatorial seats in Nevada, where Democrat Steve Sisolak and Republican Adam Laxalt are fighting over the governor's mansion currently held by Republicans, and Iowa, where Democrat Fred Hubbell is looking to oust Republican incumbent Kim Reynolds.\n\nA win by either Democrat would cement each as a key figure in the 2020 presidential nomination fight; both Nevada and Iowa are key early states.\n\nThe most unexpected race of the night could be in Alaska , where the current governor, independent Bill Walker, ended his re-election campaign in October to back former Sen. Mark Begich, the Democratic candidate running against Republican Mike Dunleavy. Republicans believe the race will be an easy pick up for them, but the lack of reliable polling and unexpected withdrawal of the current governor has a chance of delivering a late-night surprise.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correctly state that Trump lost the state of Minnesota in 2016."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Your health is on the ballot in the midterm election", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/r42qPiRb8Ek/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:30", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Voters in 37 states will have more than candidates to choose in Tuesday's election. There are more than 150 statewide measures on ballots this midterm election , and several involve health-related issues such as Medicaid expansion, marijuana, abortion, grocery taxes and charges related to drug use and possession.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlabama, Oregon and West Virginia have measures that are aimed at restricting abortion access. If passed, Alabama's Amendment 2 will add language to the state Constitution to give a fetus the same rights as a human who has been born.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters in Alabama worry that the amendment could be used to criminalize some forms of in-vitro fertilization and contraception. There are also concerns that should the US Supreme Court end Roe v. Wade, this amendment would be a \"trigger ban,\" meaning abortion would be outlawed in the state.\n\nThis \"personhood\" ballot measure doesn't have exemptions like in other states' laws that carve out the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or the danger to the life of the mother.\n\nOregon's Measure 106 would end state funding for abortions. Women who are public employees or who are on Medicaid would no longer get coverage for the procedure. There are exceptions for rape, incest, and a pregnancy that is a threat to the woman's health.\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1 , also known as the No Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment, would explicitly state that its Constitution has nothing in it that \"secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" It also has an exception for rape, incest, fetal anomaly or threats to the woman's life. It would essentially restrict Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nMarijuana\n\nVoters in four states will have to decide how they feel about marijuana. In Michigan and North Dakota, they will consider whether recreational use should be legal for adults over 21. North Dakota's amendment would also automatically expunge the record of someone who had a conviction related to weed.\n\nOther states' weed-related initiatives focus on medical marijuana; 31 states and the District of Columbia have laws that legalize or decriminalize it.\n\nMissouri has three medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot this year. Amendment 2 would legalize medical marijuana, tax it at 4% and guarantee that the money would be spent on health care services for veterans. Amendment 3 also would legalize it for medical reasons and tax it at 15%, and the money would have to be spent to create a Biomedical Research and Drug Development Institute, a state-run institution that would look for cures for disease. The money that the drugs would earn would go back to the state.\n\nIf voters say yes Proposition C , a separate ballot question, would also legalize medical marijuana and tax it at 2%, and the money would have to go toward veterans, drug treatment, education and law enforcement.If voters say yes to all three , the one that gets the \"largest affirmative vote shall prevail.\"\n\nIn Utah, if voters say yes to Proposition 2, individuals with qualifying illnesses would get access to medical marijuana.\n\nHealth care\n\nMontana, Idaho, Nebraska and Utah will consider expanding Medicaid. Montana's I-185 would also raise taxes on tobacco products to help fund the expansion and other health care programs.\n\nIdaho's Proposition 2 would expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level, as would Nebraska's Initiative 427 and Utah's Proposition 3 . In Utah, that expansion would be funded in part by a sales tax increase.\n\nThere may be additional election-related changes with Medicaid. If Democrats win in Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Florida, there's a possibility those states could expand Medicaid as well. In Florida alone, a million people would get health care coverage if Medicare is expanded in that state. Potentially, 2.7 million additional Americans could get coverage if elections go Democrats way in those states.\n\nIn Montana, the ballot question could end the Medicaid expansion there. The Tobacco industry has spent millions in the state to fight the initiative since it would double the cigarette task to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion.\n\nOther health care initiatives are on the ballot in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 4 would authorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. Proposition 8 would require dialysis clinics to refund patients for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care. Supporters of the initiative believe this would incentivize clinics to spend money on health care improvements rather than putting it toward their profits.\n\nProposition 11 would require people who work on ambulances to stay on call during breaks and require employers to give EMTs and paramedics additional training and some paid mental health services.\n\nQuestion 1 in Massachusetts would limit the number of patients assigned to registered nurses working in a hospital. The state has such restrictions for intensive care units but not for any other part of the hospital.\n\nNevada's Question 4 would require the state legislature to remove taxes on durable medical equipment, oxygen equipment and mobility devices that are prescribed by a licensed provider.\n\nOther health matters\n\nIn Massachusetts, with Question 3 , voters will decide whether they want to keep a law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public places like restaurants, stores, hotels and hospitals. There's no federal law that provides such protections. Without them, supporters of the ballot question say, people who identify as transgender could be denied access to doctors' offices, hospitals and other medical care.\n\nSouth Dakota's Initiated Measure 25 would increase taxes on tobacco products. Virginia's Question 2 would remove a restriction on tax exemption for the surviving spouse of a disabled veteran. Maine's Question 1 would create a payroll tax and non-wage income tax that would fund a home health care program.\n\nIn New Mexico, Bond Question A would provide $10.77 million in bonds for senior citizen facilities.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOhio will vote on Issue 1 , which would eliminate the option for a felony charge for the possession or use of drugs, would require the state to spend on programs that would include helping people get into drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, would create sentencing programs that involve drug rehab, and would prohibit courts from sending a person to prison for non-criminal probation violations."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Mother's booklet for son with autism: 'Voting is really important.

Batchelder voted for the first time in 2016, but when he voted in this year's primaries, he felt anxious and rushed. He went through a couple of ballots before he was able to fill one out properly.\n\nSo Senator created a booklet for her son titled \"Voting is really important. Here's how to do it.\"\n\nThe nine-page resource walks him through the process, complete with pictures of the ballot, which he could practice bubbling in, and reminders about the candidates running for different positions.\n\n\"Nat uses the pen to color in ONLY ONE CIRCLE: That is how you vote!\" the guide says. \"What are you going to be? Republican or Democrat?\"\n\nHis dad read it with him, as did his caregivers -- and right before voting, he practiced filling in the bubbles one by one. For Senator's son, knowing the rules and structure beforehand is key in addressing his anxiety before he can exercise his civic duty.\n\n\"For any person, the more you know about how something works, the better you're going to perform,\" Senator said.\n\nOn the final page of her booklet: a photo of a ballot being inserted into the voting machine, with an encouraging note:\n\n\"Put the paper in the slot of the machine! You did it!\"\n\nSusan Senator created a booklet about how to cast a ballot in the midterm elections for her son Nathaniel Batchelder, who was diagnosed with autism.\n\n'More at stake'\n\nSenator isn't the only one trying to develop a voting resource for people like her son.\n\n\"Is this something that's easily accessible or known about in the autism world? I don't think so,\" said Michael Bowman, senior developmental specialist at 3LPlace , an organization that provides support for adults with autism and other developmental disabilities in the Boston area.\n\nBowman has been putting together a nonpartisan lesson plan for members of the organization that uses a five-point scale indicating where candidates fall on certain issues. When he heard about Senator's booklet, he requested it so that he might incorporate how she described the physical process of voting to her son.\n\n\"It's something that we felt that we had to create in order to help empower our members,\" Bowman said.\n\nBowman said that many adults like those he works with might have difficulties communicating, but that doesn't mean they have a hard time putting together their thoughts or being informed voters.\n\nFor example, when Bowman first discussed marriage equality and abortion, he realized that members initially thought he was asking whether they themselves wanted to marry someone of the same gender or have a baby. So he reframed the questions in order to communicate these issues effectively.\n\nPeople with intellectual disabilities \"rarely receive instruction or other supports to encourage their participation in voting,\" according to a 2015 survey of people who care for and work with them. Most respondents said they \"believed that teaching individuals to vote was important and worthwhile and that instructional materials could be prepared that would allow people ... to understand varying political platforms or positions on at least some political issues.\"\n\nSome respondents also expressed concerns, saying they were \"mindful of the time requirements and the potential for personal bias to influence the instructional process.\"\n\nSenator said she guides all three of her sons as a parent would, and only one has a diagnosis of autism. Her family doesn't always agree on everything, she said -- but one of the things that's different about Batchelder is that \"he's a very black-and-white thinker.\" In order to have those conversations, she finds ways to be clear and concrete about issues that impact his everyday life.\n\nFor example, support from Medicaid allows Batchelder to live in an apartment with caregivers and lead an active life, playing sports, singing in a rock band, volunteering and recycling at a high school, Senator said.\n\nBatchelder sings at a Special Olympics event in Marlborough, Massachusetts, in August 2017.\n\nFor many people with disabilities, \"their livelihood depends on their health care,\" said Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n\n\"They have arguably more at stake than many of us.\"\n\n'Nobody should be invisible'\n\nA number of states have requirements that voters be \"competent\" in order to vote, which can have the effect of stripping away the right to vote from people with certain disabilities, Mathis said.\n\nThe US Election Assistance Commission keeps data on voters removed from registration rolls due to \"mental incompetency,\" but it's hard to say exactly how many people across the country have been prevented from voting due to disability, she added.\n\n\"Our problem with those laws is that they hold people with disabilities to a higher standard than all other voters,\" Mathis said.\n\nAccording to this year's voting rights guide led by the Bazelon Center, 40 states and the District of Columbia have policies in state constitutions or election laws that could restrict someone's right to vote if they have such a disability.\n\nOften, these policies are based on guardianship status, Mathis said, which may have been imposed after a single episode in which the person was in crisis -- as with someone who didn't take their medications or who didn't have access to services they needed.\n\n\"The consequence of that: The person is now living with the inability to make decisions about basic things for the rest of their life,\" she said.\n\nMore restrictive state policies might prevent people under guardianship from voting, while other states have less restrictive policies or ones that are difficult to enforce. Some \"middle-ground\" states might require some sort of challenge in order to prove \"competence\" -- for example, by answering questions about the governor's name or issues on the ballot, Mathis added.\n\n\"We don't expect that of voters without disabilities. We don't scrutinize the rationality of their choices,\" she said.\n\n\"I think if you ask the average voter on the street some of the questions that people with disabilities get asked in these guardianship proceedings, they wouldn't be able to answer them.\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, where Batchelder lives, people with intellectual disabilities can vote in elections unless that person's guardianship specifically states that they can't vote.\n\nSeven states' laws also use \"outmoded and stigmatizing terms\" such as \"idiots,\" \"insane persons\" and \"of unsound mind,\" according to the Bazelon Center guide.\n\n\"Even though the laws evolve over time and they may get better in some ways, it takes a very long time to get away from these fundamental views of people with disabilities as incapable,\" Mathis said. \"That's the biggest stereotype of people with disabilities.\"\n\nShe questioned why we need a voter competence standard at all, especially when 10 states have no such standard. \"The way that we know that people are competent to vote is if they show up to vote and they want to make a choice,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHowever, barriers to voting go beyond which laws are on the books, experts say. Some people may lack transportation, not know how to use the voting equipment, feel discouraged from failed attempts in the past or have a physical disability that makes a polling place inaccessible to them, according to one report\n\nBut for Batchelder, who proudly wore an \"I Voted\" sticker after casting his ballot Thursday, \"everything from start to finish was so nice -- and so easy,\" Senator said.\n\nThe polling workers sensed that he was different from some of the other voters, Senator said, \"and they immediately took Nat under their wing. And I was just so touched about that.\"\n\n\"Just because someone has a diagnosis of developmental disability, that should not disqualify someone,\" she said. \"Nobody should be invisible.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Japan's youth suicide rate highest in 30 years", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/27NY6iSR6V8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:31", "body_paragraphs": "Tokyo (CNN) More Japanese children and teenagers killed themselves between 2016 and 2017 than in any year since 1986, according to a new government report.\n\nThe latest survey shows 250 elementary and high school age children took their own lives in that year for a variety of reasons including bullying, family issues and stress, the country's Ministry of Education said Monday, according to local media.\n\nThose figures were 5 up on the previous year, and the highest since 1986, when 268 pupils died.\n\n\"The number of suicides of students have stayed high, and that is an alarming issue which should be tackled,\" ministry official Noriaki Kitazaki told reporters.

Sege said there are other forms of discipline that parents can employ, no matter their child's age.\n\nFor instance, for children younger than 1 who might be misbehaving, \"the best thing to do is just pick them up and move them somewhere else, distract them, change the subject -- and that's usually all they need and they can handle it,\" he said. \"Your average 6-month-old child doesn't have the ability to learn the rules. They will eventually.\"\n\nFor toddlers and preschoolers, Sege recommended using the time-out method , which involves a child sitting quietly by him- or herself.\n\n\"What we talk to parents about is paying attention to your child's good behavior and paying less attention when they're misbehaving,\" Sege said.\n\n\"Kids like attention, they crave that, and if they misbehave, we recommend something called a time-out,\" he said. \"If they're 2 years old, you have to ignore them for two entire minutes.\"\n\nFor older children, Sege said, typically allowing the natural consequence of misbehavior play out can be effective.\n\n\"So if they run out in the street, you don't want the natural consequence to be that they get run over by a car. But a natural consequence might be that they have to hold your hand when they're in the street or they can't go out on their own past a busy street until you've observed them always looking both ways,\" Sege said.\n\nIn other words, holding Mom's or Dad's hand becomes the consequence.\n\nAll in all, \"the loving relationship between a child and their parents is the most important relationship that there is,\" Sege said.\n\n\"Parents can use that relationship to teach their children right from wrong without inserting violence, shame and humiliation into that relationship,\" he said. \"As a result, children are more likely to grow up feeling secure and positive, knowing how to regulate their own behavior.\"\n\nThe science on spanking and child development\n\nThe policy statement is consistent with what research has found on the relationship between corporal punishment and adverse outcomes among children, said Rebecca Ryan, a developmental psychologist and associate professor at Georgetown University who was not involved in the statement.\n\nYet Ryan, who has studied the use of corporal punishment, noted that only a correlational relationship has been found, not a causal one.\n\n\"Nobody has randomly assigned children to receive different types of parenting or different types of discipline strategies, per se. ... So it's difficult for anybody to say spanking a child causes that child later on to be more aggressive, even though there are theories to suggest that could be why the correlation exists,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"Although all the evidence is correlational, there's little correlational evidence that it's an effective strategy, and if it were effective, you should see correlational evidence,\" she said.\n\n\"If it were an effective strategy, you would either see no correlation between spanking and child behavior, or you would see a correlation that's the opposite of what you do see,\" she said. \"What you see is a positive correlation between spanking and higher levels of behavior problems. If it were effective you should see the opposite.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince research shows only a correlational relationship, some question whether children who are more aggressive or misbehave more are subsequently spanked more -- and could that be why corporal punishment has been linked with higher levels of behavioral problems among children?\n\n\"There probably is reverse causation, but one of the things that some of the longitudinal research suggests is that when you look at kids over time -- so controlling for baseline rates of misbehavior -- children who are disciplined with corporal punishment versus those who are not, who have the same kinds of behavior problems, show increases in behavior problems over time in a way that children who aren't disciplined that way don't,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"So yes, there is probably some truth to the idea that kids who are predisposed to misbehavior for whatever reason are more likely to be spanked by parents who use that form of discipline than kids who are less likely to misbehave for whatever reason,\" she said. \"But it's also true that spanking is correlated with an increase in behavior problems over time among children with similar levels of misbehavior relative to nonphysical forms of discipline.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "US mid-term election results 2018", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46076389", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:35", "body_paragraphs": "The polls have closed in all but the western states and the first results are being announced.\n\nThe Democrats have gained a few House districts in eastern states, but have lost the Senate seat of Indiana.\n\nThe Republican Party currently controls both the Senate and the House.\n\nClick on the box below for detailed results as they come in, provided by AP.

Whenever these satellites have been in storage, there is a health review,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"The instruments are switched on and tested and we see whether there has been a degradation. The European Space Agency (Esa) and industry did a tremendous job to put all the spacecraft parts - in terms of payload module, service module and instruments - into a shape where they're ready for launch.\"\n\nAll three platforms in the Metop series were purchased from European industry at the turn of the millennium. It is the most efficient and cheapest way to acquire these multi-billion-euro systems.\n\nMetop-A was the first to launch, in 2006; Metop-B followed in 2012. Both satellites were expected to work for at least five years, and their continued operation today is a boon to weather forecasters. They will now get additional data to ingest in numerical models with the launch of Metop-C.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Metop-C being prepared for launch at the European spaceport in French Guiana\n\nThe satellites are different from their geostationary spacecraft \"cousins\" which image developing weather activity from a vantage point some 36,000km above the equator.\n\nThe polar orbiting satellites fly much lower, only 800km above the ground. Their job is to probe atmospheric conditions, detailing parameters such as humidity and temperature at different heights.\n\nThe introduction of the Metops has had an astounding impact on forecast quality. Assessments indicate the data from the first two platforms reduced errors in the 24-hour lookahead by 27%. And there have been big gains also in medium-range forecasts - those that go out to several days hence.\n\nEumetsat operates Europe's weather spacecraft from its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. But the satellites' design and procurement is overseen by Esa. It is currently working on Metop-SG (Second Generation).\n\nThese spacecraft will have much more advanced instrumentation, and in a change to the current observing strategy - those instruments will be deployed across pairs of platforms.\n\nImage caption The Microwave Humidity Sounders were batch-bought\n\nThe British MHS will be succeeded by the MicroWave Sounder (MWS). It will have significantly improved performance.\n\nThe first Metop-SG pairing is set to roll out at the end of 2022.\n\nThese are interesting times in satellite meteorology because we are starting to see very small spacecraft being launched to monitor the state of the atmosphere. The new platforms are shoebox-sized, versus the 4-tonne Goliaths like Metop.\n\n\"New space\" companies - good examples would include Spire and Orbital Micro Systems - are looking to sell weather data and forecasts to private clients.\n\nDr Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at Esa, told BBC News that his agency was evaluating the data from smallsats but it was too early to say how these novel systems would eventually fit into the general observing system.\n\n\"One should be careful not to make simple comparisons between the quality of a smallsat with a big sat,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes the illusion is created that you can just replace the big ones with the small ones. Smallsats provide what they are designed for - to be small, to be quick and for there to be many of them. Their measurements are therefore complementary to the more precise data from classical satellites like Metop.\"\n\nMetop-C lifted off on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Kourou spaceport on schedule at 21:47 local time, Tuesday (00:47 GMT Wednesday).\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Flexible office space demand 'to soar over five years'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46112503", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:48", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nFlexible working spaces are set to grow by up to 30% every year for the next five years across Europe, according to property firm Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL).\n\nAnd it says that will change the way thousands of businesses of all sizes organise their work force.\n\nJLL described it as one of the biggest shifts ever in the property industry.\n\nFirms like WeWork and IWG offer office space and services, allowing clients to shrink or grow their number of desks, or the time period they need them for.\n\nFounded in the US in 2010, WeWork is already London and New York's largest private office occupier.\n\n'Reshaping business models'\n\nSo far this year, flexible workspace operators have taken up one sixth of all new commercial property in the UK capital and last year their footprint outside the capital tripled with Manchester and Birmingham seeing the fastest growth.\n\nInitially popular with small start-up companies, these facilities are increasingly being used by large multi-national organisations who need to expand or reduce their workforce in line with the volume of work they have.\n\nDan Jones of JLL, says: \"The consumerisation of real estate is reshaping business models.\"\n\nThe rapid growth in this \"office on demand\" business has seen the value of WeWork balloon to $20bn and is not without risk.\n\nOne technology investor warned that it was beginning to look like \"a bubble\".\n\nSome property investors have pointed out that when any company buys up a huge amount of the stock of office space in the hope of selling it on in bits and pieces, there is a risk you can be left with a lot of empty offices if the economy takes a turn for the worse.\n\nFree beer\n\nWeWork has borrowed heavily to finance its expansion and the rating agencies have given it a \"junk\" or risky credit score.\n\nHowever, the flexibility of this new model is proving popular with small employers and workers who enjoy the modern collaborative feel of a shared office, as well as larger employers who are not forced to sign long leases on expensive, bespoke, trophy buildings.\n\nPerks like free beer for tenants of WeWork offices in New York proved so popular that the company was forced to impose a four pint limit per person after reports of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nFour pints is still enough to create a feel good mood about one of the biggest disruptions for decades in the way we think about heading to \"the office\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "US mid-term elections 2018: Senate slipping from Democratic reach", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46106086", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:12:51", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch live: BBC News US mid-term elections special\n\nThe Democrats' hopes of winning control of the US Senate have been dealt a blow in the mid-term elections.\n\nA Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nDemocrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, including two districts seized by the party in Virginia and Florida.\n\nRepublicans currently control both legislative chambers.\n\nPresident Trump is not up for re-election until 2020, but Tuesday's poll will shape his agenda for the remainder of his two years in office.\n\nWhat's happening in Senate races?\n\nRepublicans look likely now to retain control of the Senate -

Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on.\n\nInstead, he was the first to fall.\n\nMr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee.\n\nIn West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power.\n\nIt also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate.

Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts.\n\nThe ICO said it had identified \"serious breaches of data protection principles\" and would have issued a \"substantial fine\" if the company had not already been in administration.\n\nThe report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum.\n\nIt said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a \"view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes\", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned.\n\nFines for Banks\n\nElsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance.\n\nBoth organisations face fines of \u00a360,000 for emails which breached data laws.\n\nThe ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent.\n\nIt also imposed a \u00a315,000 fine for a separate \"serious\" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database.\n\nA final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data.\n\nThe Vote Leave campaign\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Leave campaigners celebrate the referendum result in June 2016\n\nVote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ.\n\nThe ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws.\n\nIt said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had \"transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects\".\n\nBut it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered \"electronic marketing communications\" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules.\n\n\"We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,\" it added.\n\nRemain campaigners\n\nThe ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign.\n\nThis includes looking at \"the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker\", as well as \"inadequate third party consents\", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said.\n\nIt also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about \u00a3100,000.\n\nThis was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign.\n\n\"We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,\" the report added.\n\nDid this affect the referendum?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Remain lost the EU referendum by 51.9% to 48.1%\n\nThe ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be \"transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process\".\n\n\"We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,\" it said.\n\n\"But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.\"\n\nHow wide are the ICO's concerns?\n\nThe ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet.\n\nAlthough its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider.\n\nThe watchdog's report said all the UK's 11 major political parties were engaged in risky behaviour and it had sent each a formal warning.\n\nSpecifically, the ICO is worried about their use of third-party data brokers and analytics firms that pull in and process the public's personal information via a variety of sources without necessarily checking that consent has been properly obtained.\n\nIn addition, it believes that self-regulation by Facebook and other social media firms has not been consistent or rigorous enough and now believes a code of practice \"enshrined by law\" is required to govern the way their data and platforms are used.\n\nThe regulator also highlighted deep concerns about university researchers' handling of personal data.\n\nIt said that while measures were in place to try to make sure academics behaved ethically, the same could not be said for whether they had taken enough steps to protect the public's information - particularly in cases where the same academics also did work for private companies.\n\nAs a result, the ICO said it was now working with the higher education sector to make sure privacy rules are followed."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link":

benefit sanctions, a committee of MPs has said.\n\nBenefit sanctions are penalties imposed on claimants who do not meet conditions such as attending job centre meetings.\n\nThe Work and Pensions Committee found single parents, care leavers and people with disabilities and health conditions were \"disproportionately vulnerable\" to, and affected by, sanctions.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions insisted its scheme was \"reasonable\".\n\nA DWP spokesman added that sanctions were \"only used in the minority of cases\".\n\nHowever, the committee's report stated the human cost of the current system was \"too high\".\n\nAs well as missing appointments, sanctions can be imposed for failure to show efforts to find work, and can see claimants lose 100% of their jobseeker's allowance or universal credit standard allowance.\n\nIn some \"higher level\" cases - such as a failure to take up paid work - claimants can lose benefits for as long as three years.\n\nThe committee's report recommended the maximum period for such sanctions should be two months for the first failure to comply and four to six months for subsequent breaches.\n\nIt also warned that children risked becoming \"collateral damage\" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare.\n\n'Extreme hardship and distress'\n\nWithout clear evidence that sanctions were driving a return to work by single parents, it was \"hard to justify\" their inclusion in the system, the report said.\n\nThe committee received more than 500 responses detailing claimants' experience of the sanctions regime, which included cases of \"extreme hardship and distress\".\n\nThese included a wheelchair user who \"sofa-surfed\" with friends or slept in a college library for a year when her entire benefit was wrongly taken away.\n\nAnd the committee heard from a man who was sanctioned when he missed a job centre appointment three days after being taken to hospital suffering from severe epileptic seizures.\n\nMedia

problems meant she had to move from full-time to part-time work.\n\nShe described how her monthly income fell from an average of \u00a3800 per month to \u00a3300, leaving her relying on food parcels from friends.\n\nFrank Field, who chairs the committee, said he had heard accounts of \"terrible and unnecessary hardship\" from people who had been sanctioned.\n\nThe committee said that ministers had \"no idea\" how many people were suffering as a result of the sanctions regime, because of an \"unacceptable\" failure to adequately evaluate its impact."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics",

study presented at the NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow added to a growing understanding of the importance of sleep in all health.\n\nBody clock\n\nEverybody has a body clock, which governs how the body works in a roughly 24-hour pattern. It's also known as a circadian rhythm.\n\nIt affects everything from when we sleep, to our mood and even our risk of a heart attack.\n\nBut not everybody's clock tells the same time.\n\nMorning people or \"larks\" are early to rise, peak earlier in the day and are tired earlier in the evening.\n\nEvening people or \"owls\" find it harder to get up in the morning, are productive later into the evening and prefer to go to sleep late.\n\nTake our quiz to find out whether you are a morning type, or an evening owl.\n\nAnd this is involved in breast cancer?\n\nThe researchers think so. They used a clever new way of analysing data - called Mendelian randomisation.\n\nThey looked at 341 snippets of DNA (the instructions for the human body) that control whether we are likely to be a lark or an owl.\n\nThey used this knowledge to perform an experiment on more than 180,000 women in the UK Biobank project and nearly 230,000 women in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium study.\n\nThey showed people genetically programmed to be \"larks\" were less likely to have breast cancer than those programmed to be owls.\n\nBecause these bits of DNA are set at birth and are not linked to other known causes of cancer, like obesity, it means the researchers are reasonably confident body clocks are involved in cancer.\n\nHow big is the effect?\n\nAround one in seven women in the UK will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.\n\nBut this study only looked at a small, eight-year snapshot of a woman's life.\n\nIn that time it showed two in 100 owls developed breast cancer compared with one in 100 larks.\n\nDr Rebecca Richmond, one of the researchers from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: \"The findings are potentially very important because sleep is ubiquitous and easily modified.\n\n\"Previous research has looked at the impact of shift work, but this is showing there may be a risk factor for all women.\"\n\nAge and family history are some of the main risk factors for breast cancer.

It is the most efficient and cheapest way to acquire these multi-billion-euro systems.\n\nMetop-A was the first to launch, in 2006; Metop-B followed in 2012. Both satellites were expected to work for at least five years, and their continued operation today is a boon to weather forecasters. They will now get additional data to ingest in numerical models with the launch of Metop-C.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Metop-C being prepared for launch at the European spaceport in French Guiana\n\nThe satellites are different from their geostationary spacecraft \"cousins\" which image developing weather activity from a vantage point some 36,000km above the equator.\n\nThe polar orbiting satellites fly much lower, only 800km above the ground. Their job is to probe atmospheric conditions, detailing parameters such as humidity and temperature at different heights.\n\nThe introduction of the Metops has had an astounding impact on forecast quality. Assessments indicate the data from the first two platforms reduced errors in the 24-hour lookahead by 27%. And there have been big gains also in medium-range forecasts - those that go out to several days hence.\n\nEumetsat operates Europe's weather spacecraft from its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. But the satellites' design and procurement is overseen by Esa. It is currently working on Metop-SG (Second Generation).\n\nThese spacecraft will have much more advanced instrumentation, and in a change to the current observing strategy - those instruments will be deployed across pairs of platforms.\n\nImage caption The Microwave Humidity Sounders were batch-bought\n\nThe British MHS will be succeeded by the MicroWave Sounder (MWS).

The new platforms are shoebox-sized, versus the 4-tonne Goliaths like Metop.\n\n\"New space\" companies - good examples would include Spire and Orbital Micro Systems - are looking to sell weather data and forecasts to private clients.\n\nDr Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at Esa, told BBC News that his agency was evaluating the data from smallsats but it was too early to say how these novel systems would eventually fit into the general observing system.\n\n\"One should be careful not to make simple comparisons between the quality of a smallsat with a big sat,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes the illusion is created that you can just replace the big ones with the small ones. Smallsats provide what they are designed for - to be small, to be quick and for there to be many of them. Their measurements are therefore complementary to the more precise data from classical satellites like Metop.\"\n\nMetop-C lifted off on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Kourou spaceport on schedule at 21:47 local time, Tuesday (00:47 GMT Wednesday).\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Helpline to tackle bullying in chemistry", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46100053", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images/Universal Images Group\n\nBullying and harassment is such a problem in the world of chemistry that a dedicated helpline is being set up for victims, a scientific body says.\n\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry says people were being denied opportunities because of \"a culture of secrecy\" and the 'unchecked power of managers'.\n\nThe research showed both men and women have been bullied and harassed by colleagues.\n\nBut it was mostly women who were discriminated against.\n\nIt's hoped the helpline will increase the number of women chemists.\n\n'Rock stars'\n\nProfessor Rachel O'Reilly is now Head of the Chemistry School at the University of Birmingham.\n\nBut, in previous roles, she says she's \"had issues or witnessed others\" facing discrimination.\n\n\"I've been called 'little woman' a lot.\"\n\nImage copyright Rachel O'Reilly Image caption Rachel O'Reilly hopes the helpline will bring changes to her industry\n\nAt a previous university, she was told that having children would create more work for other people in her department.\n\n\"It makes me really cross and really disappointed.\"\n\nShe says: \"Academics can be a bit like rock stars.

With an atmosphere largely consisting of carbon dioxide and temperatures that vary between 20C and -125C, the Red Planet isn't exactly ideal for human occupation.\n\nWe'd have to adapt to living almost entirely within sealed habitats - so outdoors-y types need not apply.\n\nBut there is perhaps a bigger issue in play.

Season two of the series begins on 11 November.\n\nMars' Oscar-winning executive producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer are responsible for a long list of hit Hollywood movies, including Splash, Cocoon, A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13, as well as landmark television series such as From the Earth to the Moon, which told the story of the space race.\n\nRon Howard told BBC News that while he's a big fan of space exploration, he was not initially sold on the importance of settling Mars.\n\n\"When I first began the series a couple of years ago, I thought it was a great idea to do an adventure about going to Mars and we should make it as real as we possibly could,\" Mr Howard says.\n\nImage copyright Dusan Martincek Image caption The series explores conflict between scientific and commercial interests in a burgeoning Mars colony\n\n\"But I wasn't sure I believed in the idea of going to Mars.

Season two is set nine years later and follows the fortunes of the first fully-fledged colony. The script tackles the everyday challenges of the settlers, including the first births on the Red Planet, outbreaks of disease and mechanical breakdowns.\n\nIt also documents the tensions between scientists who want to study the planet and private companies who want to profit from its natural resources.\n\n\"Here in our show, we have interests that are not entirely aligned in the expedition. Private sector vs this international group of scientists. And it hasn't all been worked out on Earth; they each have their agendas and their orders. It's in the fine print that the conflict develops,\" said Mr Howard.\n\nImage copyright NAtional Geographic Image caption An outbreak of disease strikes the colony in season two\n\nThe series features an international organisation that is responsible for the scientific exploration of Mars. Indeed, many experts have argued that spreading the effort and cost of a real-life crewed Mars mission between countries is the only viable course of action if we want to get there anytime soon.\n\nYet, with US support for the International Space Station proposed to end in 2024, and reliance on the Russian Soyuz rocket for flights to the space station to cease in coming years, it might seem that we're approaching the culmination of an unprecedented era of international co-operation in human spaceflight.\n\nViewpoint: When will we send humans to Mars?\n\nViewpoint: Should we send humans to Mars?\n\nAsked what would be needed to make a real Mars settlement a success, Mr Howard told me: \"I think if there's a lesson in our season, it's that the more co-ordinated human beings can be internationally, both in terms of scientific exploration, national interests and corporate interests, the more alignment the better.\"\n\nThe documentary segments of season one featured some high-profile real-life stories, such as the daily operations of Musk's SpaceX and astronaut Scott Kelly's year-long mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015/2016. Mr Howard said he thought it would initially be more difficult to find case studies for season two, but found plentiful material at one of Earth's last frontiers - the Arctic. Here, the interests of oil-drilling abut with those of scientific researchers and environmentalists on a regular basis.\n\nImage copyright SpaceX Image caption The series drew on real-life plans from SpaceX to send humans to Mars; this shows the huge prototype fuel tank for a rocket\n\n\"Exploring various aspects of the parallel stories where industry and science are clashing, and the ecology of the planet is at risk, aligned beautifully with what it would take to begin really settling on Mars, where human beings are having to really impact their environment.\n\n\"So it turned out to be very interesting and useful. Also, because we learned a lot in season one, I think we did a better job of targeting the documentary material that would support and reinforce the drama of the scripted material, so I think the whole thing is even a little bit more seamless. If audiences respond well to this season, and we do more seasons, we're already understanding that there are some great ways to keep applying the documentary side to the ongoing adventure of colonisation and beyond.\"\n\nElon Musk has outlined his real-life plans for Mars colonisation in some detail. Though there is no firm timeline, he envisions a fully reusable transportation system that would take 80 days to get to Mars. His rocket and spaceship combination would stand 122 metres tall - bigger than the Apollo-era Saturn V rocket - and carry 100 people at a time.\n\nMusk has said he believes a Mars colony would need about a million people to make it self-sustaining - one of his ultimate hopes.\n\nImage copyright Dusan Martincek Image caption The colonists run a gamut of challenges as they strive to make humans an interplanetary species\n\nImage copyright NAtional Geographic Image caption The scientists have established a colony known as Olympus Town\n\nMr Howard said the series drew on some of the engineering ideas proposed by SpaceX, Nasa and other sources. \"The spaceniks can probably see it's its own style of hybrid. We didn't use any props from other movies, so we had to create everything. We did our own designs and for our production team, on a TV budget, it was probably like throwing together your own blueprint for going to Mars.\"\n\nSpeaking about the new series to a small group of journalists, Mr Howard explained why he thought space exploration had such enduring appeal: \"My fascination started as a boy witnessing the space race and all that was accomplished.\n\n\"It made the whole world feel like human beings were capable of so much more and there was so much to look forward to. So between the mystery of space and the drama and excitement and thrill of humankind's ability to explore it and actually experience it - it has just captured our imagination.\n\n\"One of the things I learned from working on Apollo 13 and interviewing so many of the astronauts who went on the Moon and walked on the Moon - they were so matter of fact about it.\"\n\nHe added: \"To them it was just proof it was possible to go, and that was the next horizon.

For many Muslims elections are an opportunity to help elect candidates who they think will tackle hateful rhetoric and policies that they believe unfairly target them.\n\nA family friend, an older Muslim woman, is calling all of her friends and driving them to the polls to vote. So far, she's taken 15 people to vote. And its not even noon.\n\n\n\nShe came to the US as a refugee from Iraq in 2002. She's as American as anybody else.#GoVote \u2014 Khaled Beydoun (@KhaledBeydoun) November 6, 2018\n\nStand together. Work together. March together. Vote together.

None of us have ever seen turnout like this before in this Brooklyn district. And it's pouring rain.

Many Native Americans do not live in areas with street addresses, nor can they afford to get new IDs with a street address assigned through the statewide 911 system.\n\nFree programmes have managed to help more than 2,000 voters on four reservations get proper credentials.\n\nFor more on voter suppression in the US, read this.\n\nWalkouts begin\n\nStudents have started walking out of classes to vote in this year's midterms. For many who turned 18 after the 2016 US presidential election, the 2018 vote will be their first chance to cast a ballot.\n\nRead our full report here.\n\nHillary Clinton: 'Today, we say enough'\n\nHillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump, has issued a powerful call to action in a series of Tweets on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Democrat former Secretary of State accused Trump of undermining \"democratic institutions and values\" in the US.\n\n\"We'll vote for fantastic candidates all over the country- including a historic number of women- who want to raise wages, fight for justice, and help more people get health care,\" Clinton wrote.\n\nIf they win, they'll do great things for America. Let's exercise our birthright as Americans today, put those people in office, and continue the hard work of saving our democracy.\n\n\n\nIt'll take all of us. Happy Election Day. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 6, 2018\n\n#IVoted trends on US Twitter\n\nThe hashtag trends every election and it usually includes selfies of voters outside polling stations and people wearing \"I voted\" stickers.\n\nHere are some of the more interesting tweets this year:\n\nMy father instilled in me the importance of my vote from a very young age. I've never missed an election. My vote stands for gun reform, climate change, inclusion, the end of white privilege and racism, women's rights, HUMAN RIGHTS. Forward not backward.

Both major parties claim higher turnout will benefit their final showing.\n\nEarly voting in Texas alone surpassed the state's total turnout for the 2014 midterms.\n\nACLU advice on voter intimidation\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has this advice out on voter intimidation. It comes within a context of widespread allegations of voter suppression and confusion over voter ID laws in some states.\n\nHate speech and the midterms\n\nThis year's midterms have been bitterly fought but beyond everyday electioneering lies something more sinister.\n\nThe run-up to this year's vote including a failed pipe bombing campaign targeting opponents of President Donald Trump, the murder of two African-Americans in a grocery store by a white supremacist, and a massacre of Jewish worshippers by a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nCoupled with the violence, has been a rise in anti-immigration rhetoric within parts of the Republican party, spearheaded by Trump and others on the GOP's far-right.\n\nIn this piece, Al Jazeera looks at how the rise of hate speech and violent acts are linked.\n\nExplaining Trump's appeal in small town Kentucky\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to Trump-supporting residents in Irvine in Kentucky to gauge why the Republican president attracts such strong support.\n\nIssues that came up frequently? Immigration and jobs. Read the story here.\n\nResidents of more eastern states head to the polls\n\nResidents in parts of Alabama, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee are heading to the polls.\n\nMany polling stations across these states and Washington, DC opened at 7am local time (12GMT).\n\nPolls open in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia\n\nPolls opened at 6:30am local time (11:30GMT) in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nThe Senate race in West Virginia will be one to watch as Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin faces off against Republican Patrick Morrisey.

But given that we are only one day away from important elections in the US, we wanted to let people know about the action we've taken and the facts as we know them today.\n\n\"Once we know more - including whether these accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities - we will update this post.\"\n\nThe first polls in the US midterm elections have opened in Vermont. Polling stations in the rest of the state and many other states on the East Coast will soon follow between 6am and 7am local time (11-12GMT)\n\nA look at the US Capitol on the morning of the midterm elections\n\nPolls will open across the East Coast in the coming hours. Here's a look at the US Capitol building early on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. is shrouded in fog as America prepares to head to the polls in the high-stakes 2018 midterm elections. https://t.co/UArp71kKgt pic.twitter.com/mciFJgIEn7 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) November 6, 2018\n\nGoogle tells Americans to 'go vote'\n\nGoogle changed its google doodle in the US to 'go vote' with a link to find a polling place.\n\nIt's #ElectionDay and @Google is making sure everyone knows where to vote.\n\nClicking on \"Go Vote\" will take you to another page to find your polling place. pic.twitter.com/C3ZA4fD25e \u2014 Vicki Bradley (@VickiMarie31) November 6, 2018\n\nTrump: In a sense, I'm on the ticket\n\nTrump used his final pitch to ask voters to help preserve \"fragile\" GOP victories that could be erased by Democratic gains in Congress.\n\nAcknowledging the stakes in the closing days of campaigning, Trump stressed to voters that everything is on the line.\n\n\"It's all fragile. Everything I told you about, it can be undone and changed by the Democrats if they get in,\" Trump told supporters. \"You see how they've behaved. You see what's happening with them. They've really become radicalised.\"\n\nTrump spent his final hours on the campaign trail in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, where his rhetoric on immigration turned harsh and he lobbed attacks at Democrats.\n\n\"The contrast in this election could not be more clear. Democrats produce mobs,\" Trump said at his final rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. \"That's what's happened. Republicans produce jobs.\"\n\nTrump has also sought to distance himself from any potential blame if Republicans lose control of the House, saying, \"My primary focus has been on the Senate.\"\n\nWhatever the outcome, Trump made clear he knew his political future was on the line.\n\n\"In a sense, I am on the ticket,\" he told a raucous crowd in Cleveland.\n\nVoting officials under scrutiny amid heavy election turnout\n\nFederal and state officials have been working for nearly two years to shore up the nation's election infrastructure from cyberattacks by Russians or others seeking to disrupt the voting process.\n\nIt turns out that many of the problems are closer to home.\n\nEarly voting leading up to Tuesday's midterm election have revealed a wide variety of concerns with voting and registration systems around the country - from machines that changed voter selections to registration forms tossed out because of clerical errors.\n\nElection officials and voting rights groups fear that voter confidence in the results could be undermined if such problems become even more widespread on Election Day, as millions of Americans head to the polls to decide pivotal races for Congress and governor.\n\nHannity joins Trump on stage despite claiming he wouldn't\n\nFox News Channel insisted Sean Hannity would not be part of President Donald Trump's last midterm election rally on Monday \u2014 but Trump called on Hannity to join him onstage anyway.\n\nHannity appeared on the podium with the president and delivered brief remarks. Another Fox News personality, Jeanine Pirro, also appeared onstage with the president.\n\nHannity, cable news' most popular personality, told the crowd, \"By the way, all those people in the back are fake news.\"\n\nIt was an extraordinary scene after the news network had worked on Monday to establish distance between Hannity and the campaign. Trump's campaign had billed Hannity as a \"special guest\" at the rally, but Fox had said that wasn't so, insisting he was merely broadcasting his show from the arena.\n\nUS officials warn Americans of 'influence efforts'\n\nAmericans must be aware of \"foreign actors\" attempting to influence their choice as they vote in the midterm elections, a joint statement by US security agencies warned.\n\nNaming Russia, China, and Iran, the statement said local officials would be on hand at polling stations to prevent any attempts to sway American voters.\n\n\"Our agencies have been working in unprecedented ways to combat influence efforts and to support state and local officials in securing our elections,\" it said.\n\n\"But Americans should be aware that foreign actors - and Russia in particular - continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord.\"\n\nThe departments said agents do this by spreading false information on candidates and disseminating propaganda on social media.\n\n\"The United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from Russia, China, Iran, or other nations,\" the statement said.\n\nMonday, November 5\n\nNBC, Fox News and Facebook pulled a widely-condemned anti-immigrant ad by President Donald Trump's campaign as a bitter election fight for control of the US Congress headed on Monday for an unpredictable finish.\n\nThe 30-second ad, which was sponsored by Trump's 2020 re-election campaign and which debuted online last week, featured courtroom video of a Mexican citizen convicted in the 2014 killings of two police officers, juxtaposed with scenes of a US-bound caravan of Central American migrants and refugees.\n\nCritics, including members of Trump's own party, had condemned the spot for its open racism.\n\nThe ad fit into the president's near-daily attacks on immigrants and the caravan, which he has described as an \"invasion\".\n\n\"I now feel one with America.\"\n\n\"I'll finally feel like part of this country.\"\n\n\"Trump doesn't represent our country\"\n\n\"To have a voice as an Arab-American, that's very special\"\n\nThis is what four first-time immigrant voters told Al Jazeera in the leadup to Tuesday's poll. Read more.\n\nFirst polls will open in Vermont at 5am local time (10GMT). Many other states on the East Coast will follow between 6am local time (11GMT) and 7am local time (12GMT).\n\nMost polling places will stay open for at least 12 hours. Many precincts will close between 6pm local time and 8pm local time, in their respective time zones.\n\nWith midterms less than a day away, right-wing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's seven-year grip on the state could be slipping away.\n\nWalker and his opponent, Democrat Tony Evers, were neck-and-neck in the closely-watched gubernatorial race as they made their final pitches to voters on campaign stops, television and online.\n\nOn Friday, Emerson College published a survey putting Evers at 51-percent support and incumbent Walker at 46 percent. Previous polls had the two opponents back and forth in the lead.\n\nRead about other governor races you should check out here.\n\nTrump: 'Everything at stake' in midterms\n\nDonald Trump embarked Monday on a whirlwind final push across three states to stop Democrats from breaking his Republicans' stranglehold on the US Congress.\n\n\n\nCleveland, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana; then Cape Girardeau, Missouri: it will be well after midnight before the real estate billionaire and populist showman gets back to the White House - and only a few hours more before polls open Tuesday across the world's largest economy.\n\n\n\n\"Everything we have created and achieved is at stake on election day,\" Trump told a cheering crowd in Cleveland, as he kicked off his furious last round of campaigning.\n\n\n\nTrump is not on the ballot in the midterms, in which the entire House of Representatives and a third of the Senate are up for grabs. But in a hard-driving series of rallies around the country the most polarising US president for decades has put himself at the centre of every issue.\n\nWays in which voters can be disenfranchised\n\nMillions of Americans will be barred from casting ballots in Tuesday's crucial midterm elections due to electoral rules at the state level, which effectively exclude many minority voters to the detriment of Democrats.\n\nHere's a look at states where these restrictions could impact the poll's outcome.\n\nDisenfranchised convicts\n\nNearly six million Americans are excluded from voting because they are imprisoned, on parole or awaiting sentencing.\n\nAfrican-Americans, who are overrepresented in the US penal system, are four times more likely to be unable to vote than the rest of the population, according to The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organisation.\n\nRules vary widely by state, with some like Maine and New Hampshire allowing inmates to vote.\n\nBut in places such as Kentucky, Iowa, Virginia and Florida, any conviction, even for a minor offense like possession of marijuana, results in lifelong disenfranchisement. In Florida, 1.5 million people are disenfranchised.\n\nProof of residential address\n\nThere is no national identity card in the United States, with each state defining what documents can be used as identification at the polling station.\n\nAnd according to the American Civil Liberties Union, an influential civil rights organisation, several states have imposed restrictive rules since 2010.\n\nExact match rules\n\nIn Georgia, the data voters provide when registering at the polls have since 2017 been compared to those given when applying for a driver's license or social security number.\n\nIf there are discrepancies, authorities might refuse the registration.\n\nSome 53,000 applications are currently pending, 70 percent of which belong to African-Americans, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nStacey Abrams slams Kemp's hacking claims\n\nGeorgia's Democratic candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams, has pushed back against Republican opponent Brian Kemp for accusing Democrats of hacking voter registration systems, a charge he levelled without evidence.\n\n\"I think, unfortunately, Secretary Kemp has not only abused his power, he has failed to do his job,\" Abrams said in an interview with ABC on Monday. \"And you don't deserve a promotion when you do not serve the people you've been hired to serve.\"\n\nKemp, the pro-Trump Republican candidate in Georgia's governor's race, who also oversees the state's elections, made the accusation on Sunday, a move analysts said highlighted the inherent conflict between his twin roles.\n\nEarly voting dramatically higher than 2014\n\nFigures compiled by data analysis firm Catalist, puts the number of people voting before polling day in the 2018 midterms at more than 12 million people higher than 2014.\n\nIn 2014, 19,052,732 people voted early in the midterms, in 2018, the number so far is 31,299,060.\n\nThe number of young people voting early has more than doubled. The figure for people under 30 in 2014 was 1,027,499 and in 2018, the number so far is 2,314,126.\n\nWhy the Democrats will struggle in the Senate.\n\nThe Democrats may be polling higher nationally, but they have their work cut out in trying to get control of the Senate.\n\nAs it stands, the Republicans have a slender 51 to 49 majority in the upper house of Congress.\n\nBirmingham University's Professor Scott Lucas explains that most seats up for election are Democrat and the ones that are Republican are mostly in GOP strongholds.\n\n\"Despite the seven percent polling lead, Democrats have a far tougher task than with the House, as they are defending 25 of the 35 contested seats, and the 10 Republican seats are all in GOP strongholds,\" he said.\n\n\"There are nine key races, with five of the seats currently held by Democrats and four by Republicans: Florida (D), Indiana (D), Missouri (D), North Dakota (D), Montana (D), Tennessee (R), Texas (R), Nevada (R), Arizona (R).\n\n\"Democrats will struggle to take Texas or Tennessee on current projections. So they must win the other two GOP seats and hold their five vulnerable seats.\"\n\nMeeting Trump supporters in small town Kentucky\n\nWhat attracts support for Trump in Estill County, Kentucky? The US president may not be on the ballot but for these voters the Republican's promise to bring new jobs to the deeply Red state resonates strongly.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDemocrats hold double digit popular poll lead over Republicans\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll says the Democrats have a 13 point lead over the Republicans nationally, with 55 percent of voters preferring the party to the GOP's 42 percent.\n\nWomen are more likely to vote Democrat than republican by a margin of almost two to one, while men were evenly split along party lines, according to the poll.\n\nWhite men are most supportive of the Republicans, with 57 percent support, with the number rising to 67 percent for those without college degrees.\n\nRepublican candidate, who oversees election, investigates Democrats for 'hacking'\n\nControversial Republican gubernatorial candidate, Brian Kemp, who is also overseeing Tuesday's election in Georgia has accused his opponents, the Democrats, of trying to hack the state's online voter database.\n\nKemp, has drawn criticism for refusing to relinquish his role as Georgia's secretary of state, while he stands for governor.\n\n\"I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cybercrimes,\" said Candice Broce, who works for Kemp.\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director at the state Democratic Party called the announcement a \"political stunt\" to cover up weaknesses of a system Kemp runs.\n\nKemp's opponent, Democrat Stacey Abrams, has called him \"an architect of voter suppression\" and said he's used his current position to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots.\n\nIf elected, Abrams would be the first black governor of a US state.\n\nSunday, November 4\n\nRNC chairperson: 'Good people too trying to get into country'\n\nRepublican National Committee chairperson Ronna McDaniel has said she knows \"good people too are trying to get into this country\".\n\n\"They see the prosperity, they see the economic growth\", she said in an interview with CNN on Sunday regarding a controversial video US President Donald Trump tweeted last Wednesday that critics have called \"racist\".\n\nThe video depicts Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican immigrant who was deported from the US, but returned and was convicted in February of killing two California deputies.\n\nText on the video alleges Democrats \"let him\" into the US, followed by images of the migrant caravan, composed largely of Hondurans, currently passing through Mexico on way to the US.\n\n\"Who else would Democrats let in?\" the video asks.\n\nThe video's claims about Bracamontes were rated as \"pants on fire\" by Politifact, a fact-checking journalistic outlet.\n\nThe rating is a reference to the idiom - \"Liar, liar, pants on fire\" - and Politifact considers statements worthy of this designation as those which are \"not accurate\" and make a \"ridiculous\" claim.\n\n\"The reality is that Bracamontes' last illegal entry was under Bush, a Republican president. The majority of his time going undetected was also on the Republican watch,\" Politifact wrote.\n\nMidterms to see record $5.2bn political spending: report\n\nThe 2018 midterms are set to be the most expensive on record, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), a Washington, DC-based group that tracks political spending.\n\nCRP estimates total spending to cross $5.2bn, a 35 percent increase over the 2014 midterms, in which spending remained short of $4bn. The group said it would be the largest increase in at least two decades.\n\n\"The significance of this election is clear. But whether it's a blue wave or a red wave, one thing is certain: a wave of money is surging towards Election Day, much of it coming from the wealthiest donors targeting this year's most competitive races,\" Sheila Krumholz, CRP's executive director, said on the group's website.\n\nBoth the US parties are raising funds at record levels, but CRP said the sizeable increase is being driven primarily by Democrats.\n\nDemocrat candidates are expected to spend over $2.5bn this year, while the figure for the Republicans stands at roughly $2.2bn, according to the group.\n\nDemocrats expected to win House, Republicans to keep the Senate\n\nMost opinion polls and political handicappers expect Democrats to win the 23 seats they need to assume control of the 435-seat House of Representatives.\n\nDemocrats currently hold 193 seats in the House, while Republicans control 235.

On his watch, wages are up, unemployment is down, and the poverty rate has continued a four-year decline.\n\nLast summer, the Trump administration even declared the country's war on poverty \"largely over and a success\".\n\nYet, experts say that little of the country's economic boom is reaching poor and middle-class households. On top of that, the Trump administration has pursued a long-standing Republican economic agenda of tax cuts, reduced social spending, and deregulation, which benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and poor.\n\n\"When we look under the hood, we see that the Trump economy is one in which gains haven't been equally shared - not even close - across the income spectrum,\" said Rachel West, director of poverty research at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think-tank.\n\n\"As a result, there are many, many families today \u2026 who are sort of squeezed between stagnant wages that really haven't increased appreciably in decades and rising costs,\" West said.\n\nThe diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and the rest of the country have been accelerated by Trump administration initiatives such as last year's tax overhaul, West said.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, one of the biggest changes to the tax code in US history, contained numerous measures benefiting large corporations and the wealthy.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think-tank, 53 percent of the law's tax benefits will accrue to the wealthiest five percent of taxpayers, while the bottom 60 percent will receive just 13 percent of benefits.\n\nAmong the measures benefiting the wealthy are a reduction in marginal tax rates and easing of the estate tax, which primarily affects large net worth individuals.\n\nSome industries gained more than others. For example, the law increases the amount that real estate developers can deduct from their taxes by claiming that their property depreciated due to wear and tear.\n\nThis massive giveaway to the wealthiest taxpayers is projected to increase the national debt by nearly $2 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Growing deficits will provide Republicans with a pretext for slashing public programmes on which lower and middle class Americans rely, said Josh Hoxie, a researcher at the Institute for Policy Studies.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"We are, by not taxing [the rich], bankrupting the public sector,\" Hoxie said. \"The most direct impact of this comes from people like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said that we have to blame our budget deficit on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security and thus need to look at cutting those programs.\"\n\n\"I'd say that is a fairly direct and imminent threat to poor and middle class families,\" Hoxie said.\n\nAs an example of how Trump and his Republican party seesaw between tax cuts for the wealthy and attacks on government programmes that help the poor, Hoxie pointed to the debate earlier this year over the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. The federal programme provides health insurance to millions of children from low-income families. Last spring, the Trump administration called on Congress to cut $7bn from CHIP's budget, sparking a legislative fight between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAround the same time, the technology company Apple took advantage of the new tax law to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars it had held offshore, saving approximately $40bn of the more than $78bn that it would have paid under the former tax code.\n\n\"With one hand, they're saying, 'we can't afford to provide health insurance to 9 million low-income children',\" Hoxie said. \"With the other hand, they're doling out tens of billions of dollars of tax cuts to one of the most profitable corporations in the history of money.\"\n\nSocial spending cuts\n\nThe Trump administration and Congressional Republicans have sought to roll back federal spending on welfare and poverty reduction programmes, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nSNAP, a 2008 rebranding of the Food Stamp Program, is the government's premier anti-hunger initiative, with a history dating to the 1930s. At the cost of about $70bn in 2017, SNAP helps one in eight Americans meet their nutritional needs. Two thirds of SNAP aid goes to families with children.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed moving SNAP from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Health and Human Services, along with other federal programmes that provide aid to poorer Americans.\n\nConservative advocates argue that consolidating programmes within a single agency will allow the federal government to do a better job of tracking beneficiaries and enforcing restrictions like work requirements.\n\nIn addition, Congressional Republicans have pushed a Farm Bill, which funds SNAP, that would make it significantly harder for low-income Americans to enroll or remain in the programme, in part by expanding work requirements.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, or CBPP, the bill would also require states to expand their bureaucracies to track SNAP recipients, enforce restrictions on benefits, and report data to the federal government.\n\nThe net effect of these changes, according to the CBPP, would be to \"take away SNAP benefits from recipients across the country who need them while failing to achieve the proponents' stated goals of improving employment outcomes.\"\n\nPartisan disagreements over these proposed changes to SNAP have stalled the 2018 Farm Bill. Republicans plan to bring the bill to a vote after Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nDeregulation\n\nOne of Trump's first actions as president was to sign an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation. The president often brags about slashing Washington, DC's \"red tape\" on behalf of business, a perennial Republican goal.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nTrump's handling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, shows what this looks like in practice, as well as the potential effects on lower-income Americans.\n\nThe CFPB was formed under the Obama administration in response to the 2008 financial crisis and tasked with protecting US citizens from abusive financial practices such as predatory lending. Under Obama, the CFPB investigated businesses like the payday loan industry, which provides loans primarily to low-income workers at very high interest rates.\n\nPresident Trump tapped Republican Mick Mulvaney to serve as acting director of the CFPB. Mulvaney had previously sponsored legislation as a US representative that would have abolished the CFPB.\n\nAs acting director, Mulvaney has slowed the CFPB's activities to a crawl, prompting some staffers to leave. One former CFPB employee, who left the bureau during the Obama administration and requested not to be identified, speculated that the Trump administration has opted to cripple the bureau rather than abolish it outright in an effort to limit the CFPB's long-term regulatory scope.\n\nThe CFPB is one of the few federal agencies regulating nonbank financial businesses, which provide financial services without a full banking license and are subject to less oversight than banks. At the same time, financial services such as mortgages have increasingly moved to the nonbank sector - last year, nonbank financial companies issued more than half of all mortgages. Some analysts worry that these potentially under-regulated loans could recreate the conditions that produced the 2008 financial crisis."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:20", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:25", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Pompeo Allows Sanctions Exception for Iran Port Development", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pompeo-allows-sanctions-exception-for-iran-port-development/4647841.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:31", "body_paragraphs": "The top U.S. diplomat has granted an exception to certain U.S. sanctions that will allow the India-led development of a port in Iran as part of a new transportation corridor designed to boost Afghanistan's economy, a State Department spokesman said Tuesday.\n\nThe exception granted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to U.S. sanctions reimposed on Iran on Monday also will permit the construction of a railway line from Chabahar port to Afghanistan, and for shipments to the war-torn country of non-sanctionable goods, like food and medicines, the spokesman said.\n\nIn addition, Afghanistan will be allowed to continue importing Iranian petroleum products, the spokesman said.\n\n\"These activities are vital for the ongoing support of Afghanistan's growth and humanitarian relief,\" the spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters.\n\nThe sanctions reimposed on Iran's oil exports \u2014 its main revenue source \u2014 and financial sector were triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to abandon the 2015 international deal designed to block Tehran's development of nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump denounced the deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program.

Though not on the ballot, the president loomed large over decision day, among both supporters and detractors. Across the country, people talked about this election as one of the most momentous in their lifetimes \u2014 a fight for the very soul of America.\n\n\n\nHere's what some of them had to say.\n\n\n\nFirst-timers\n\n\n\nThe extreme divisions in politics helped motivate Lance Whatley, 29, to vote for the first time in his life Tuesday. Whatley was among dozens of people standing in line as a cold rain drenched their clothes outside the Vinings Library northwest of Atlanta.\n\n\"I feel like there's a lot of polarization with the rhetoric you're hearing on both sides,'' he said. Whatley, a software engineer, was still unsure whom he would vote for in the hotly contested race for Georgia governor. His wife favored Democrat Stacey Abrams, but he was leaning toward the Republican, Brian Kemp. \"It might be a game-time decision for me when I get in the voting booth.''\n\nRafael Acosta, a college student in McAllen, Texas, rose early on the first day of early voting in his state. The 22-year-old wanted to be sure he was at the head of the line for his first time voting. In doing so, he said he was making a statement for his many friends who are part of the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrival, or DACA, program that has protected young immigrants from deportation.\n\nThe son of Mexican immigrants, Acosta watched as Trump stirred fears of the migrant caravan in Mexico, and it troubled him that troops have been dispatched to his community. \"I think [the Republicans] are exaggerating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't need the Army here.''\n\n\u200bWashington \u2018out of control\u2019?\n\nBonnie Slade, 45, a federal employee who lives in Potomac, Md., said politics in the nearby nation's capital shaped her vote this year. \"Washington is out of control,'' she said. \"The politics are kind of dirty always, but this time is a bit much ... like do I want to vote? Does it really make a difference? But I felt like it's my duty.''\n\nSlade, who is black, said Trump was part of what motivated her to vote. \"He doesn't stand for anything that I believe in, period,'' Slade said. \"I'm a minority. I'm a woman. And he's just not the best choice for me, personally, or my family.''\n\n\n\nKeith Lesage, 50, a design engineer in Plainfield, Conn., said he was focused more on state issues but was concerned about the division he saw in the country. \"It's horrible, some of the rhetoric that's coming out of Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not picking on Republicans or Democrats, but we're all adults. Let's come together for the American people \u2014 not this is what the red side wants, this is what the blue side wants. It's getting to the point where it's just dividing the country \u2014 and it's real sad to watch.''\n\n\n\nStay the economic course\n\n\n\nRichard and Aleshia Murphy took their 7-month-old daughter when they voted early in suburban Los Angeles. The couple, who moved seven months ago from Reno, Nevada, to Lakewood, Calif., said the economy was foremost on their minds.\n\n\"I want to keep things going,'' said Richard, a Republican train operations manager. \"My work feels the booming economy. We're hiring more people, all positions, from the bottom to the top.''\n\nBoth Murphy and his wife, an independent, voted for Trump in 2016 and like where the country's headed. \"I'd rather have somebody who's going to come off as a complete jerk \u2014 but you know exactly what they're thinking because they have no filter \u2014 than a slick-haired politician that literally tells you anything you want to hear just so that you support them,'' Aleshia Murphy said.\n\nRepublican Susan Riebold, 53, who owns a homebuilding business in Imperial, Mo., described herself as a nationalist and called Trump's tariffs \"amazing.'' She said business in Imperial, south of St. Louis, was thriving, and she decried Democrats \u2014 including Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill \u2014 for voting against the recent tax overhaul.\n\n\"Trump has fought for the middle class and the small businesses, and Claire voted against everything that is benefiting us in the middle class,'' Riebold said. \"The country is more strong, confident and unified than it's ever been, and most of the confidence and people feeling unified and patriotic again has come right before Trump got in and since he's been in.''\n\nSwitching sides\n\nJosh Rent, 43, a small-business owner and registered Republican in Portland, Maine, voted mostly for Democrats this time as \"a protest vote to Trump.''\n\n\"I'm generally a fairly reliable Republican,'' he said. \"This is the first time I ever voted pretty much Democrat all the way down the ballot.'' Of the president, he said: \"I don't think that dividing us is getting us anywhere. We need to actually solve this stuff.''\n\nKevin Benson, 38, a graphic designer from Westerville, Ohio, said he's registered as a Republican, considers himself an independent, and voted all Democrat on Tuesday. Why? \"Mostly Trump, just as a check. I'm frustrated with the way he's acting,\u201c he said. \u201cPlus, just Republicans in general. ... I'm just kind of dissatisfied across the board with them.''\n\nBenson said health care was his No. 1 issue and that he'd like to see a single-payer system. \"We're heading in the wrong direction.''\n\n\n\nHealth care concerns\n\nFred Hoy, 61, of Reno, Nevada, said he'd been out of work for 13 years but was scraping by to pay his rent and care for several ill family members and friends. Hoy has diabetes and is on Medicaid. He was taking care of his aunt in California but returned to Reno to make sure he could vote in time \u2014 and he was voting Democratic because he was worried Republicans will cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security and threaten protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"If we don't have some kind of medical,'' he said, \"we're going to collapse as a nation.''\n\nIn Juneau, Alaska, Will Muldoon, 34, considers himself nonpartisan. Health care is an issue he'd like to see Congress take up, \"but that's scary. It's almost an \u2018I don't know that they could come up with better than what we have right now\u2019 type of thing. My confidence in them having the competency to do OK on that's not too high,'' said Muldoon, a mainframe technician.\n\nCordell Chaney, 30, works at Superior Essex, a company that manufactures wire and cable products in Fort Wayne, Ind. A member of the steelworkers union, Chaney is a father of four with a fifth on the way. He said affordable health care \u2014 including maintaining coverage of pre-existing conditions \u2014 was the most important issue for him. He voted straight Democratic Tuesday, which included supporting U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly.\n\nChaney worries that if the Republicans remain in control of Congress, they'll get rid of Obamacare: \"It really upsets me. ... Decent health insurance should be a right. Everybody should have that. Right now, it's endangered.''\n\nAt odds over immigration\n\nRachel Geiger's purple hair matched her black and purple dress and helped her stand out among hundreds of people waiting to get into an arena in Orlando, Fla., where U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke ahead of the election on behalf of Florida's Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Geiger, 33, a blogger from Ocala, said \"Trump and immigration'' were the two motivating issues for her when she early-voted.\n\n\"It's completely inhumane what he's doing,'' she said, referring to policies that have included sending troops to the border, separating immigrant children from their parents and efforts to build a wall. She voted a straight Democratic ticket.\n\nIn Phoenix, substitute teacher and lifelong Republican Kay Matthews said that while the economy was important to her, immigration was just as important. She's troubled by any influx of immigrants entering the country illegally.\n\n\"I've been taught as a young child that you respect the law. You don't have to always agree with it, but you do respect it,'' the 72-year-old said. Matthews doesn't want Democrats taking control of either chamber of Congress, because she fears they would try to impeach Trump.\n\nMelvin Rubi Avila, 19, voted in his first national election Tuesday, and he was mindful of what weight that carried. The son of a Mexican mother and Honduran father, the Raleigh, N.C., native said he was voting for an America that won't see people like them as a threat.\n\n\"They are very proud,'' Avila said, an \"I Voted'' sticker shining brightly from the breast of his black leather jacket. \"They feel like me voting is them voting as well. His father has temporary protected status, but Trump's rhetoric has made him fearful that his parents will be deported. \"I sometimes have nightmares about it.'' And as a so-called \"birthright citizen,'' Avila is disturbed by the president's recent attacks on the 14th Amendment. \"That's not what America's all about.''\n\nA few miles north in the town of Wake Forest, N.C., Diana Zambrano \u2014 also a child of immigrants \u2014 had a different take. Wake Forest is in the 2nd Congressional District, where Republican incumbent Rep. George Holding was facing a serious Democratic challenge from Linda Coleman, an African-American. The GOP has run ads criticizing Coleman's support of sanctuary cities. Zambrano's mother is from the Dominican Republic, and her father is from Venezuela. Both came legally, and she was born here.\n\n\"This country provides a lot of opportunities,'' she said. \"So if you're able to come here legally ... I think that that should be something that is open to you. But for those that sort of circumvent that system, I don't necessarily agree with that.'' Zambrano, 43, wouldn't reveal how she voted, other than to say \"conservative.''\n\n\n\n#MeToo still on minds\n\n\n\nLea Grover, 34, a mother of three young daughters in Cary, Ill., saw the midterms as a referendum on Trump and \"a referendum on empathy, and whether or not we as a nation have any.''\n\nGrover, a former independent and now a registered Democrat, was particularly outraged by the hearings over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct. \"The Kavanaugh hearings were so upsetting, for every woman I know, not just because of Kavanaugh specifically but because it was an opportunity for the entire Republican establishment to say [to women], 'We don't care.' Not 'We don't believe you,' but 'We don't care.' ''\n\nGrover is a victim of sexual violence and works for a nonprofit that helps survivors. \"My congressman has refused to speak out in defense of survivors of sexual violence. He refused to speak out against Brett Kavanaugh. He refused to speak out against the president. He has been utterly silent in the face of #MeToo.''\n\n\n\nNatalie Pig, 31, an attorney in Arnold, Mo., said she'd back Republican candidates because she wanted to see Congress do more to support Trump. She cited what she called the \"smear campaign'' against Kavanaugh, calling him \"a victim of the current political environment.''\n\n\"If there are facts that someone has committed a crime, I'm the first person to want to hear all about that,'' she said. \"But at the same time, if we're taking measures to slander someone or defame them in a way that is going to inhibit the American process, then that's not helping us. So we need people who are going to support President Trump.''\n\n\n\n\u200bMoment for young voters?\n\n\n\nAt 22, Porter Nelson considers himself an independent and says he is a regular voter, but a ballot measure in Washington state creating a carbon tax motivated him even more this year.\n\n\"It seems kind of like the world's ending and if we don't do something pretty quick, you know, I would like to have kids that have a planet. I would like to have a planet. So anything on any ballot anywhere that I see as being for the environment ... I'm all for that,'' he said.\n\nNelson thinks Congress, too, needs to take climate change more seriously. \"I would love to see our political body finally get it through their heads that the gerrymandering, the politicking, the races, the runoffs don't matter if in 20 years the whole West Coast is on fire.\"\n\nAdam Alhanti was a typical high school student looking forward to graduating. Turning 18 and voting wasn't really on his mind. But after his classmates and teachers were gunned down at his Parkland, Fla., school in February, everything changed.\n\n\"I realized there's so much more going on than what's in my city,\" he said. \"There are so many things that we need to take charge of, and we can really make a difference \u2014 not just in our nation but right down to our local communities with who represents us in office.'' He'd like to see Congress take up gun reform. \"Gun violence ... is something we really need to talk about more. Even though it seems like it's something being spoken about day after day, there's nothing being done \u2014 not a single thing that will really save the lives of American citizens.''\n\nA steady stream of voters turned out in a light drizzle in the Albany suburb of Guilderland, N.Y., Tuesday morning. Lauryn Schrom, 27, a graphic designer, did not vote in the last off-year election but made a point to do it this time because of her dissatisfaction with the Trump administration. She said recent political events had \"opened my eyes'' on issues like civil rights and women's rights.\n\n\"If you are not engaged enough in the political process, then you can lose your rights,'' she said, holding an \"I Voted'' sticker. \"I have a significant number of friends who are LGBT, and it's disturbing that they could lose civil rights as well.''\n\nStraight ticket\n\n\n\nKeri Cook, 47, a Democrat from Westerville, Ohio, said she voted for Democrats straight down her ballot, including Danny O'Connor in his U.S. House rematch against Republican Rep. Troy Balderson. \"I'm hoping that the House flips,'' Cook said, adding that Democrats' stances on health care and gun control factored into her vote and she wanted Trump out of office. \"I think he's poison. ... His stance on the LGBTQ community, on women, on African-Americans, on immigrants \u2014 is just, to me, hate.''\n\n\n\nJudy Jenkins, 60, a Republican who works in accounting, also cast her ballot in Westerville, Ohio, and also went straight ticket: for all GOP candidates. She said she used to vote for people from both major parties but was so upset by how Kavanaugh was treated that she vowed not to vote for a Democrat again. \"I'm not even going to consider it because of the hell they put his family through. No one should have to go through that, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.''\n\nTest of Trumpism\n\nIf the midterm elections are a referendum on Trump, then Patricia Maynard, a 63-year-old retired teacher in Skowhegan, Maine, is clear: \"I think he's doing a great job. ... He's doing better than I expected. I'm not saying that I always like his rhetoric; I wince when I hear that. But I feel like he really loves this country and has a good head on his shoulders as far as his ability to get things done.''\n\nShe goes on: \"I think he's very capable and very smart, a lot smarter than people think he is. Some people think he is too high and mighty to get along with the common people, but I think that's where he feels most comfortable, with average people. And he feels their pain.''\n\n\n\nRepublican Tina Kazee, a 50-year-old hospital worker from Canal Winchester, Ohio, said she stuck with her party when voting early. She said Trump has \"his flaws,'' but she feels he and the Republicans have done a good job for the country. \"I think he's helped our economy. I think there's more for him than there is against him, as far as my standards and my beliefs. I don't think he's a perfect man, but I think he loves America \u2014 I think his heart is for America \u2014 and I stand for that. ... It's just that his tone needs to be turned down a little bit. Speak from the heart, but do it a little bit softer.''\n\n\n\nMorris Lee Williams, a 67-year-old member of Zion Travelers Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis and an Army veteran, said he's worried the country \"is going down the tubes.''\n\n\"We've forgotten our decency. We've forgotten the truth. We're supposed to be a group of people, Americans, who are supposed to be that light in the world. Instead of a light, it's turned into a nightmare.'' Williams said Trump is the catalyst \"for a lot of crazy stuff going on, inciting people into hatred, to doing things that go against what this country stands for. It's just so divisive. It's almost as if he wants the country to go back to the way it was in the 1920s and before. Everybody's got their place and a certain group of people rule. ... This is supposed to be a place where if you have the desire, the education, the guts and the fortitude to do better, you can do better.''\n\n\u200bMourning the lost middle\n\nFamily law attorney Patrick Markey, 43, voted in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. He generally votes Democratic but has supported Republican candidates in Illinois, including in this election. Markey dislikes the two-party system because the polarization that dominates Capitol Hill creates a logjam. \"It's almost two tribal camps. I'd like to see more [elected officials] with middle-ground views who can vote conservatively sometimes and sometimes more liberally. ... I think that most of the country is like that. But in order to get into politics, you have to kiss the ring of the party. ... A lot of the normal moderate people just feel left out.''\n\nVirginia Gollin, 75, describes herself as a moderate Republican but says she changed parties to become a Democrat because moderates are \"like a dinosaur.''\n\n\"I'm not by nature a progressive. But we're at a point in our country where all of the things I think we should have are being fiercely attacked,'' said Gollin, a retired airline worker in Hopatcong, N.J. She cited as an example the Affordable Care Act, which she does not want to see gutted.\n\n\n\nTory Dibbins, a physical therapist from Portland, Maine, said she'd like to see more independent candidates, but she understands that many voters believe there's too much at stake to risk vote-splitting. The 53-year-old Democrat cast her ballot Tuesday. If Democrats do win big, she said, they should show they're willing to compromise. \"If you're going to talk about 'Let's end the divisiveness and be inclusive,' then you have to try to get people to be more bipartisan. ...

Lawyers for the state say that although lethal gas is authorized, it has never been used and there are no protocols for it.\n\nThe high court on March 20 blocked Bucklew's execution on a 5-4 vote, with four of the court's five conservative justices voting to deny the request. The conservative justice who voted with the court's four liberals to grant the stay, Anthony Kennedy, has since retired and was replaced by Kavanaugh.\n\nBucklew was convicted of the 1996 murder in southeastern Missouri of Michael Sanders, who was living with Bucklew's former girlfriend Stephanie Ray at the time. Bucklew fatally shot Sanders at his trailer home, kidnapped and raped Ray, shot at Sanders' 6-year-old son and wounded a police officer before being apprehended, according to court papers.\n\nBucklew's condition has caused large, blood-filled tumors to grow on his face, head, neck and throat, according to court papers.\n\nA ruling is due by the end of June."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Afghan Pilot Writes Moving Tribute to Fallen American Soldier", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-pilot-writes-moving-tribute-to-fallen-american-soldier-/4647401.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:33", "body_paragraphs": "The Afghan pilot who penned a moving letter to the wife and seven children of a U.S. service member and city mayor killed in Afghanistan told VOA he wrote the tribute to let them know how much their husband and father had inspired him.\n\nMaj.

Though not on the ballot, the president loomed large over decision day, among both supporters and detractors. Across the country, people talked about this election as one of the most momentous in their lifetimes \u2014 a fight for the very soul of America.\n\n\n\nHere's what some of them had to say.\n\n\n\nFirst-timers\n\n\n\nThe extreme divisions in politics helped motivate Lance Whatley, 29, to vote for the first time in his life Tuesday. Whatley was among dozens of people standing in line as a cold rain drenched their clothes outside the Vinings Library northwest of Atlanta.\n\n\"I feel like there's a lot of polarization with the rhetoric you're hearing on both sides,'' he said. Whatley, a software engineer, was still unsure whom he would vote for in the hotly contested race for Georgia governor. His wife favored Democrat Stacey Abrams, but he was leaning toward the Republican, Brian Kemp. \"It might be a game-time decision for me when I get in the voting booth.''\n\nRafael Acosta, a college student in McAllen, Texas, rose early on the first day of early voting in his state. The 22-year-old wanted to be sure he was at the head of the line for his first time voting. In doing so, he said he was making a statement for his many friends who are part of the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrival, or DACA, program that has protected young immigrants from deportation.\n\nThe son of Mexican immigrants, Acosta watched as Trump stirred fears of the migrant caravan in Mexico, and it troubled him that troops have been dispatched to his community. \"I think [the Republicans] are exaggerating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't need the Army here.''\n\n\u200bWashington \u2018out of control\u2019?\n\nBonnie Slade, 45, a federal employee who lives in Potomac, Md., said politics in the nearby nation's capital shaped her vote this year. \"Washington is out of control,'' she said. \"The politics are kind of dirty always, but this time is a bit much ... like do I want to vote? Does it really make a difference? But I felt like it's my duty.''\n\nSlade, who is black, said Trump was part of what motivated her to vote. \"He doesn't stand for anything that I believe in, period,'' Slade said. \"I'm a minority. I'm a woman. And he's just not the best choice for me, personally, or my family.''\n\n\n\nKeith Lesage, 50, a design engineer in Plainfield, Conn., said he was focused more on state issues but was concerned about the division he saw in the country. \"It's horrible, some of the rhetoric that's coming out of Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not picking on Republicans or Democrats, but we're all adults. Let's come together for the American people \u2014 not this is what the red side wants, this is what the blue side wants. It's getting to the point where it's just dividing the country \u2014 and it's real sad to watch.''\n\n\n\nStay the economic course\n\n\n\nRichard and Aleshia Murphy took their 7-month-old daughter when they voted early in suburban Los Angeles. The couple, who moved seven months ago from Reno, Nevada, to Lakewood, Calif., said the economy was foremost on their minds.\n\n\"I want to keep things going,'' said Richard, a Republican train operations manager. \"My work feels the booming economy. We're hiring more people, all positions, from the bottom to the top.''\n\nBoth Murphy and his wife, an independent, voted for Trump in 2016 and like where the country's headed. \"I'd rather have somebody who's going to come off as a complete jerk \u2014 but you know exactly what they're thinking because they have no filter \u2014 than a slick-haired politician that literally tells you anything you want to hear just so that you support them,'' Aleshia Murphy said.\n\nRepublican Susan Riebold, 53, who owns a homebuilding business in Imperial, Mo., described herself as a nationalist and called Trump's tariffs \"amazing.'' She said business in Imperial, south of St. Louis, was thriving, and she decried Democrats \u2014 including Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill \u2014 for voting against the recent tax overhaul.\n\n\"Trump has fought for the middle class and the small businesses, and Claire voted against everything that is benefiting us in the middle class,'' Riebold said. \"The country is more strong, confident and unified than it's ever been, and most of the confidence and people feeling unified and patriotic again has come right before Trump got in and since he's been in.''\n\nSwitching sides\n\nJosh Rent, 43, a small-business owner and registered Republican in Portland, Maine, voted mostly for Democrats this time as \"a protest vote to Trump.''\n\n\"I'm generally a fairly reliable Republican,'' he said. \"This is the first time I ever voted pretty much Democrat all the way down the ballot.'' Of the president, he said: \"I don't think that dividing us is getting us anywhere. We need to actually solve this stuff.''\n\nKevin Benson, 38, a graphic designer from Westerville, Ohio, said he's registered as a Republican, considers himself an independent, and voted all Democrat on Tuesday. Why? \"Mostly Trump, just as a check. I'm frustrated with the way he's acting,\u201c he said. \u201cPlus, just Republicans in general. ... I'm just kind of dissatisfied across the board with them.''\n\nBenson said health care was his No. 1 issue and that he'd like to see a single-payer system. \"We're heading in the wrong direction.''\n\n\n\nHealth care concerns\n\nFred Hoy, 61, of Reno, Nevada, said he'd been out of work for 13 years but was scraping by to pay his rent and care for several ill family members and friends. Hoy has diabetes and is on Medicaid. He was taking care of his aunt in California but returned to Reno to make sure he could vote in time \u2014 and he was voting Democratic because he was worried Republicans will cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security and threaten protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"If we don't have some kind of medical,'' he said, \"we're going to collapse as a nation.''\n\nIn Juneau, Alaska, Will Muldoon, 34, considers himself nonpartisan. Health care is an issue he'd like to see Congress take up, \"but that's scary. It's almost an \u2018I don't know that they could come up with better than what we have right now\u2019 type of thing. My confidence in them having the competency to do OK on that's not too high,'' said Muldoon, a mainframe technician.\n\nCordell Chaney, 30, works at Superior Essex, a company that manufactures wire and cable products in Fort Wayne, Ind. A member of the steelworkers union, Chaney is a father of four with a fifth on the way. He said affordable health care \u2014 including maintaining coverage of pre-existing conditions \u2014 was the most important issue for him. He voted straight Democratic Tuesday, which included supporting U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly.\n\nChaney worries that if the Republicans remain in control of Congress, they'll get rid of Obamacare: \"It really upsets me. ... Decent health insurance should be a right. Everybody should have that. Right now, it's endangered.''\n\nAt odds over immigration\n\nRachel Geiger's purple hair matched her black and purple dress and helped her stand out among hundreds of people waiting to get into an arena in Orlando, Fla., where U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke ahead of the election on behalf of Florida's Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Geiger, 33, a blogger from Ocala, said \"Trump and immigration'' were the two motivating issues for her when she early-voted.\n\n\"It's completely inhumane what he's doing,'' she said, referring to policies that have included sending troops to the border, separating immigrant children from their parents and efforts to build a wall. She voted a straight Democratic ticket.\n\nIn Phoenix, substitute teacher and lifelong Republican Kay Matthews said that while the economy was important to her, immigration was just as important. She's troubled by any influx of immigrants entering the country illegally.\n\n\"I've been taught as a young child that you respect the law. You don't have to always agree with it, but you do respect it,'' the 72-year-old said. Matthews doesn't want Democrats taking control of either chamber of Congress, because she fears they would try to impeach Trump.\n\nMelvin Rubi Avila, 19, voted in his first national election Tuesday, and he was mindful of what weight that carried. The son of a Mexican mother and Honduran father, the Raleigh, N.C., native said he was voting for an America that won't see people like them as a threat.\n\n\"They are very proud,'' Avila said, an \"I Voted'' sticker shining brightly from the breast of his black leather jacket. \"They feel like me voting is them voting as well. His father has temporary protected status, but Trump's rhetoric has made him fearful that his parents will be deported. \"I sometimes have nightmares about it.'' And as a so-called \"birthright citizen,'' Avila is disturbed by the president's recent attacks on the 14th Amendment. \"That's not what America's all about.''\n\nA few miles north in the town of Wake Forest, N.C., Diana Zambrano \u2014 also a child of immigrants \u2014 had a different take. Wake Forest is in the 2nd Congressional District, where Republican incumbent Rep. George Holding was facing a serious Democratic challenge from Linda Coleman, an African-American. The GOP has run ads criticizing Coleman's support of sanctuary cities. Zambrano's mother is from the Dominican Republic, and her father is from Venezuela. Both came legally, and she was born here.\n\n\"This country provides a lot of opportunities,'' she said. \"So if you're able to come here legally ... I think that that should be something that is open to you. But for those that sort of circumvent that system, I don't necessarily agree with that.'' Zambrano, 43, wouldn't reveal how she voted, other than to say \"conservative.''\n\n\n\n#MeToo still on minds\n\n\n\nLea Grover, 34, a mother of three young daughters in Cary, Ill., saw the midterms as a referendum on Trump and \"a referendum on empathy, and whether or not we as a nation have any.''\n\nGrover, a former independent and now a registered Democrat, was particularly outraged by the hearings over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct. \"The Kavanaugh hearings were so upsetting, for every woman I know, not just because of Kavanaugh specifically but because it was an opportunity for the entire Republican establishment to say [to women], 'We don't care.' Not 'We don't believe you,' but 'We don't care.' ''\n\nGrover is a victim of sexual violence and works for a nonprofit that helps survivors. \"My congressman has refused to speak out in defense of survivors of sexual violence. He refused to speak out against Brett Kavanaugh. He refused to speak out against the president. He has been utterly silent in the face of #MeToo.''\n\n\n\nNatalie Pig, 31, an attorney in Arnold, Mo., said she'd back Republican candidates because she wanted to see Congress do more to support Trump. She cited what she called the \"smear campaign'' against Kavanaugh, calling him \"a victim of the current political environment.''\n\n\"If there are facts that someone has committed a crime, I'm the first person to want to hear all about that,'' she said. \"But at the same time, if we're taking measures to slander someone or defame them in a way that is going to inhibit the American process, then that's not helping us. So we need people who are going to support President Trump.''\n\n\n\n\u200bMoment for young voters?\n\n\n\nAt 22, Porter Nelson considers himself an independent and says he is a regular voter, but a ballot measure in Washington state creating a carbon tax motivated him even more this year.\n\n\"It seems kind of like the world's ending and if we don't do something pretty quick, you know, I would like to have kids that have a planet. I would like to have a planet. So anything on any ballot anywhere that I see as being for the environment ... I'm all for that,'' he said.\n\nNelson thinks Congress, too, needs to take climate change more seriously. \"I would love to see our political body finally get it through their heads that the gerrymandering, the politicking, the races, the runoffs don't matter if in 20 years the whole West Coast is on fire.\"\n\nAdam Alhanti was a typical high school student looking forward to graduating. Turning 18 and voting wasn't really on his mind. But after his classmates and teachers were gunned down at his Parkland, Fla., school in February, everything changed.\n\n\"I realized there's so much more going on than what's in my city,\" he said. \"There are so many things that we need to take charge of, and we can really make a difference \u2014 not just in our nation but right down to our local communities with who represents us in office.'' He'd like to see Congress take up gun reform. \"Gun violence ... is something we really need to talk about more. Even though it seems like it's something being spoken about day after day, there's nothing being done \u2014 not a single thing that will really save the lives of American citizens.''\n\nA steady stream of voters turned out in a light drizzle in the Albany suburb of Guilderland, N.Y., Tuesday morning. Lauryn Schrom, 27, a graphic designer, did not vote in the last off-year election but made a point to do it this time because of her dissatisfaction with the Trump administration. She said recent political events had \"opened my eyes'' on issues like civil rights and women's rights.\n\n\"If you are not engaged enough in the political process, then you can lose your rights,'' she said, holding an \"I Voted'' sticker. \"I have a significant number of friends who are LGBT, and it's disturbing that they could lose civil rights as well.''\n\nStraight ticket\n\n\n\nKeri Cook, 47, a Democrat from Westerville, Ohio, said she voted for Democrats straight down her ballot, including Danny O'Connor in his U.S. House rematch against Republican Rep. Troy Balderson. \"I'm hoping that the House flips,'' Cook said, adding that Democrats' stances on health care and gun control factored into her vote and she wanted Trump out of office. \"I think he's poison. ... His stance on the LGBTQ community, on women, on African-Americans, on immigrants \u2014 is just, to me, hate.''\n\n\n\nJudy Jenkins, 60, a Republican who works in accounting, also cast her ballot in Westerville, Ohio, and also went straight ticket: for all GOP candidates. She said she used to vote for people from both major parties but was so upset by how Kavanaugh was treated that she vowed not to vote for a Democrat again. \"I'm not even going to consider it because of the hell they put his family through. No one should have to go through that, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.''\n\nTest of Trumpism\n\nIf the midterm elections are a referendum on Trump, then Patricia Maynard, a 63-year-old retired teacher in Skowhegan, Maine, is clear: \"I think he's doing a great job. ... He's doing better than I expected. I'm not saying that I always like his rhetoric; I wince when I hear that. But I feel like he really loves this country and has a good head on his shoulders as far as his ability to get things done.''\n\nShe goes on: \"I think he's very capable and very smart, a lot smarter than people think he is. Some people think he is too high and mighty to get along with the common people, but I think that's where he feels most comfortable, with average people. And he feels their pain.''\n\n\n\nRepublican Tina Kazee, a 50-year-old hospital worker from Canal Winchester, Ohio, said she stuck with her party when voting early. She said Trump has \"his flaws,'' but she feels he and the Republicans have done a good job for the country. \"I think he's helped our economy. I think there's more for him than there is against him, as far as my standards and my beliefs. I don't think he's a perfect man, but I think he loves America \u2014 I think his heart is for America \u2014 and I stand for that. ... It's just that his tone needs to be turned down a little bit. Speak from the heart, but do it a little bit softer.''\n\n\n\nMorris Lee Williams, a 67-year-old member of Zion Travelers Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis and an Army veteran, said he's worried the country \"is going down the tubes.''\n\n\"We've forgotten our decency. We've forgotten the truth. We're supposed to be a group of people, Americans, who are supposed to be that light in the world. Instead of a light, it's turned into a nightmare.'' Williams said Trump is the catalyst \"for a lot of crazy stuff going on, inciting people into hatred, to doing things that go against what this country stands for. It's just so divisive. It's almost as if he wants the country to go back to the way it was in the 1920s and before. Everybody's got their place and a certain group of people rule. ... This is supposed to be a place where if you have the desire, the education, the guts and the fortitude to do better, you can do better.''\n\n\u200bMourning the lost middle\n\nFamily law attorney Patrick Markey, 43, voted in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. He generally votes Democratic but has supported Republican candidates in Illinois, including in this election. Markey dislikes the two-party system because the polarization that dominates Capitol Hill creates a logjam. \"It's almost two tribal camps. I'd like to see more [elected officials] with middle-ground views who can vote conservatively sometimes and sometimes more liberally. ... I think that most of the country is like that. But in order to get into politics, you have to kiss the ring of the party. ... A lot of the normal moderate people just feel left out.''\n\nVirginia Gollin, 75, describes herself as a moderate Republican but says she changed parties to become a Democrat because moderates are \"like a dinosaur.''\n\n\"I'm not by nature a progressive. But we're at a point in our country where all of the things I think we should have are being fiercely attacked,'' said Gollin, a retired airline worker in Hopatcong, N.J. She cited as an example the Affordable Care Act, which she does not want to see gutted.\n\n\n\nTory Dibbins, a physical therapist from Portland, Maine, said she'd like to see more independent candidates, but she understands that many voters believe there's too much at stake to risk vote-splitting. The 53-year-old Democrat cast her ballot Tuesday. If Democrats do win big, she said, they should show they're willing to compromise. \"If you're going to talk about 'Let's end the divisiveness and be inclusive,' then you have to try to get people to be more bipartisan. ... You have to win people back to the center.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Democrats Leading in Some Key Races as Midterm Polls Close", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/lines-are-long-as-americans-render-midterm-verdict-on-trump/4647377.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:35", "body_paragraphs": "Polls were closing across the Eastern United States on Tuesday, with Democrats winning or leading several key races in a midterm election that could shift the balance of power in Washington.\n\nDemocrats picked up their first big win of the night in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., where Jennifer Wexton, a prosecutor and state senator, defeated the Republican incumbent, Representative Barbara Comstock.\n\nComstock had been expected to lose, but her defeat may be indicative of wider Democratic success, especially in the suburbs, where polls show women strongly favoring Democratic candidates.\n\nWith the Comstock result and another Democratic pickup in Florida, Democrats now need to pick up 21 more seats to retake the House of Representatives.

Many stepped up as candidates across the country in the past two years, energized by reports of Donald Trump\u2019s behavior toward women, the rise of the #MeToo movement that has publicized the pervasiveness of sexual assault, and Republican policy platforms on issues including the right to abortion.\n\nReferendum on Trump\n\nPublic opinion polls suggest opposition Democrats will retake the House but will be unable to seize the Senate from Republicans in a congressional and gubernatorial election that evolved into a referendum on President Trump's first two years in office.\n\nVoting sites have closed in more than two dozen states. Media outlets project that, as expected, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will retain their seats. But so far very few competitive races have been called.\n\nVoter turnout appeared to be very high, despite bad weather in virtually the entire Eastern United States. Polling stations across the country saw long lines, and in some cases there were problems with voting machines, in part because of wet conditions.\n\nMain issues for voters are health care, immigration and the economy, according to polls. However, Trump, who has barnstormed across the country spurring fear of a cavalcade of Central American immigrants moving north toward the U.S.-Mexico border, was also on the minds of most voters, according to exit polling.\n\n\n\n\"Of course it's motivation. I mean, I only became a citizen last year,\" said Kevin Ombija, a first-time voter originally from Kenya who now lives in Washington, D.C. \"Issues of immigrants are very dear to me. ... I definitely want to vote everything against (Trump).\"\n\nIn Orange County, California, William Moody cast his vote for Republicans, even while offering qualified support for Trump.\n\n\"I defend his belief that the border has to be protected, (but) maybe not as severe as he would do it,\" Moody said. \"The president is his own worst enemy with some of his remarks. If he'd tone it down and just do his job quietly, it'd help us all.\"\n\nImmigration focus\n\nMidterm elections are traditionally seen as a referendum on a sitting president, but this election seems especially so -- in part because Trump has held an unusually large number of rallies in support of Republicans and urged supporters to treat the election as a confirmation of his policies.\n\nAt those rallies, Trump has consistently stoked fear of immigrants, insisting his political opponents support things like \"open borders\" and crime. The strategy could backfire, however, if preliminary results from exit polls are accurate.\n\nTrump conceded in an interview on Monday that he could have taken a softer tone in his rhetoric, but denied any suggestion that his stump speeches had fostered racism in the country.\n\nAbout half of voters say Trump's immigration policies are too tough, while around a third think they're just right, according to a CNN national exit poll.\n\nThe CNN poll suggested 55 percent of voters disapprove of Trump's performance, while 44 percent approve of it. Moreover, 56 percent of those surveyed believe the country is on the wrong track and only 41 percent said it was on the right track.\n\nPower balance\n\nIf Democrats do win enough House seats to reclaim the majority, Trump would be forced to deal with a shift in the balance of power in Washington.\n\n\"The House has been a rubber stamp for the Trump agenda. It will no longer be a rubber stamp,\" said Jim Kessler of the centrist Democratic group Third Way. \"Anything that gets done will have to be a bipartisan basis.\"\n\nDemocrats are hoping for a wave election that would bring them control of the House and gubernatorial victories in key states such as Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nVoters are also deciding governor races in 36 states, as well as local positions."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Fox News Doesn't Condone Hannity Appearance with Trump", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fox-news-sean-hannity-appearance-donald-trump/4647318.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:35", "body_paragraphs": "Fox News said Tuesday that it has addressed the \"unfortunate distraction\" of Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro speaking at President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Missouri the night before, and that it doesn't condone such behavior.\n\nThe network did not say what, if any, discipline that the two network personalities would face.\n\nMeanwhile, Hannity tweeted on Tuesday that he was being \"100 percent truthful\" earlier Monday when he tweeted that \"I will not be on stage campaigning with the president.\"\n\n\"When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president's request,\" Hannity tweeted. \"This was NOT planned.\"\n\nHannity, who told the audience at Trump's rally that \"all these people in the back are fake news,\" also tweeted Tuesday that he was not referring to any of his Fox News colleagues. Fox reporter Kristin Fisher, who tweeted a copy of Fox's statement Tuesday, was covering the rally.\n\nIt's considered standard for employees of news organizations not to engage in political campaign activities, so their outlets do not appear unfair; some journalists go so far as to not vote at all for this reason. Fox News resisted Monday when the Trump campaign had advertised to its followers that Hannity would appear as a \"special guest\" at the Missouri rally, saying Hannity was only there to cover the event.\n\nHannity, cable news' most popular personality and a vocal Trump defender, has twice been publicly rebuked by Fox for campaign activity. Hannity was made to cancel a 2010 appearance in Cincinnati when it was revealed he was participating in a fundraiser for the tea party. When he was featured in a 2016 Trump campaign video, Fox told him to never do it again.\n\nSince then, Fox opinion personalities have doubled down on their support of Trump. Already No. 1 in the cable news ratings, Fox has had a strong fall with the campaign and hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with Hannity leading the way.\n\nCritics have claimed that Fox News Channel is less of a news organization than an arm of the Trump campaign, and Monday's rally gave them fresh ammunition. In the past, Hannity has said that he's a talk show host, not a journalist. But in an interview with The New York Times a year ago, he said he was a journalist, more specifically an advocacy or opinion journalist.\n\nRally appearance\n\nHannity broadcast his show from the site of the rally Monday, where he exhorted viewers to vote Republican and echoed a Trump campaign theme seen on banners: \"Promises made, promises kept.\" He spoke briefly on camera with Trump at the end of the show.\n\nWhen it was done, White House Communications director Bill Shine, a former Fox News Channel executive, high-fived Hannity, according to the White House pool report.\n\nTrump called Hannity to the stage after praising Fox, saying, \"they're very special, they've done an incredible job for us. They've been with us from the beginning.\" Hannity hugged Trump and, after lobbing his crowd-pleasing insult at the media, recited economic statistics. Pirro, a former New York state attorney general who has a weekend show on Fox, spoke after him.\n\nTheir speeches weren't televised on Fox News, but were seen on C-SPAN.\n\nHannity's appearance meant either Fox lied Monday about its collaboration with the Trump campaign, or that it has no control over Hannity, said Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal think tank Media Matters for America, which has unsuccessfully called for an advertiser boycott of Hannity's show in the past.\n\n\"Fox's admitted lack of control is only reinforced by the absence of sanction here,\" Carusone said. \"Anyone doing business with Fox News should worry about the network's inability to enforce even the most bare-minimum standards.\"\n\nIt's not clear, however, whether Hannity was sanctioned or not. Fox has not addressed the question publicly.\n\nCriticism\n\nSome surprised journalists at other news organizations didn't hesitate to make their feelings known on social media. \"The White House-Fox News nexus has rarely been as evident as tonight in Cape Girardeau,\" Philip Rucker, White House bureau chief at The Washington Post, said on Twitter.\n\nWhite House reporter Maggie Haberman of The New York Times tweeted: \"Still can't get over Hannity denying he would be on stage the whole day, getting brought up by Trump, and then pointing to actual news reporters and calling them fake.\"\n\nAlisyn Camerota, a former Fox News anchor who now hosts a morning show on CNN, said executives at Fox \"know vaguely\" that they're not supposed to have one of their hosts endorse a candidate or party, but that Hannity can't help himself.\n\n\"They're having a schizophrenic moment over there trying to figure out what their role is going to be with the Trump presidency,\" Camerota said on CNN."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "NASA Conducts Quiet Sonic Boom Tests Near Texas Gulf Coast", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-conducts-quiet-sonic-boom-tests-near-texas-gulf-coast/4647187.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:37", "body_paragraphs": "NASA is monitoring how residents near the Texas Gulf Coast react to quiet sonic booms from an experimental aircraft that could reduce commercial flight times by half.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reports that the space agency on Monday launched a two-week research project on quiet supersonic research flights near Galveston.

This can fill a gap in facial recognition, which needs close-up, high-resolution images of a person\u2019s face to work.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need people\u2019s cooperation for us to be able to recognize their identity,\u201d Huang said in an interview in his Beijing office. \u201cGait analysis can\u2019t be fooled by simply limping, walking with splayed feet or hunching over, because we\u2019re analyzing all the features of an entire body.\u201d\n\nWatrix announced last month that it had raised 100 million yuan ($14.5 million) to accelerate the development and sale of its gait recognition technology, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nChinese police are using facial recognition to identify people in crowds and nab jaywalkers, and are developing an integrated national system of surveillance camera data. Not everyone is comfortable with gait recognition\u2019s use.\n\nSecurity officials in China\u2019s far-western province of Xinjiang, a region whose Muslim population is already subject to intense surveillance and control, have expressed interest in the software.\n\nShi Shusi, a Chinese columnist and commentator, says it\u2019s unsurprising that the technology is catching on in China faster than the rest of the world because of Beijing\u2019s emphasis on social control.\n\n\u201cUsing biometric recognition to maintain social stability and manage society is an unstoppable trend,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great business.\u201d\n\nThe technology isn\u2019t new. Scientists in Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency have been researching gait recognition for over a decade, trying different ways to overcome skepticism that people could be recognized by the way they walk. Professors from Osaka University have worked with Japan\u2019s National Police Agency to use gait recognition software on a pilot basis since 2013.\n\nBut few have tried to commercialize gait recognition. Israel-based FST Biometrics shut down earlier this year amid company infighting after encountering technical difficulties with its products, according to former advisory board member Gabriel Tal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more complex than other biometrics, computationally,\u201d said Mark Nixon, a leading expert on gait recognition at the University of Southampton in Britain. \u201cIt takes bigger computers to do gait because you need a sequence of images rather than a single image.\u201d\n\nWatrix\u2019s software extracts a person\u2019s silhouette from video and analyzes the silhouette\u2019s movement to create a model of the way the person walks. It isn\u2019t capable of identifying people in real-time yet. Users must upload video into the program, which takes about 10 minutes to search through an hour of video. It doesn\u2019t require special cameras \u2014 the software can use footage from surveillance cameras to analyze gait.\n\nHuang, a former researcher, said he left academia to co-found Watrix in 2016 after seeing how promising the technology had become. The company was incubated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Though the software isn\u2019t as good as facial recognition, Huang said its 94 percent accuracy rate is good enough for commercial use.\n\nHe envisions gait recognition being used alongside face-scanning software.\n\nBeyond surveillance, Huang says gait recognition can also be used to spot people in distress such as elderly individuals who have fallen down. Nixon believes that the technology can make life safer and more convenient.\n\n\u201cPeople still don\u2019t recognize they can be recognized by their gait, whereas everybody knows you can be recognized by your face,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cWe believe you are totally unique in the way you walk.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Amazon Mum on Reports it Will Split New Headquarters", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-mum-on-reports-it-will-split-new-headquarters/4646849.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:44", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon isn\u2019t commenting on reports that it plans to split its new headquarters between facilities in two cities rather than choosing just one.\n\nThe New York Times, citing unnamed people familiar with the decision-making process, said the company is nearing deals to locate in Queens in New York City and in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., outside Washington, D.C.

In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \u201cEinsatzgruppen.\u201d\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Republican Kevin Cramer Wins North Dakota Senate Race In Pickup For GOP", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-cramer-heidi-heitkamp-north-dakota_us_5be06a9de4b09d43e3215de8", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:45", "body_paragraphs": "Republican Rep.

Following her upset win in 2012, she was seeking a second term in a state Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDespite selling herself as an agriculture-friendly, gun-supporting moderate who was willing to work with Trump, Heitkamp struggled to win over his supporters, especially in the wake of her surprise vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent with anyone other than North Dakota,\u201d Heitkamp said in a debate with Cramer last month, portraying herself as an independent-minded Democrat.\n\nPolls consistently showed Cramer leading the race.\n\nThe 57-year-old Republican initially won his House seat \u2015 the state\u2019s only one \u2015 since 2012. He surprised many political observers early this year by announcing that rather than run for the Senate, he would seek another House term. But Trump ultimately persuaded him to take on Heitkamp, an intervention by the president that Cramer stressed on the campaign trail.\n\nHe lambasted Heitkamp, 63, for opposing key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda, including last year\u2019s massive tax cut bill.\n\nHeitkamp sided with the president, however, on some of his more controversial nominations, including his picks of Gina Haspel to head the CIA and Mike Pompeo to serve as secretary of state.\n\nIn her campaign, Heitkamp spotlighted Cramer\u2019s votes for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its insurance protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. She also criticized him for supporting Trump\u2019s trade policy and his tariffs on countries like China. The consequences of that trade dispute are particularly acute in North Dakota, where soybean farmers are struggling to store mountains of the unsold crop that in the past would be bound for hungry markets in China.\n\n\u201cThis president plays hardball, no doubt about it,\u201d Cramer said of Trump\u2019s trade policy during the debate with Heitkamp. He insisted that Trump was pursuing a long-term strategy that would pay off, and that the administration would take care of struggling farmers.\n\nThe fall\u2019s controversy over Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation and Heitkamp\u2019s decision to oppose him may have ultimately signed her political death warrant \u2015 something she seemed to recognize. During an interview after her vote, Heitkamp talked about needing to follow her conscience, regardless of the political repercussions, in the wake of the sexual abuse allegations that surfaced against Kavanaugh. Last year, she had revealed her own experience with sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cIf this were a political decision for me I certainly would be deciding this the other way. There\u2019s an old saying, \u2018History will judge you, but most importantly you\u2019ll judge yourself,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I\u2019ve had and say yes\u201d to Kavanaugh."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Mitt Romney Is Back: Utah Elects Former GOP Presidential Nominee To The Senate", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitts-back-utah-elects-romney-to-senate_us_5be1d2aee4b01ffb1d06cb2f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:46", "body_paragraphs": "Mitt Romney completed one of the most circuitous comebacks in political history on Tuesday, with voters in Utah electing the one-time Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee to be the state\u2019s next senator.\n\nThe Michigan-born-and-raised Romney handily defeated Democratic nominee Jenny Wilson, an at-large member of the Salt Lake City City Council.\n\nRomney\u2019s election in heavily Republican Utah was never really in question.

The confusion was a result of an October court ruling that allowed Missourians to cast ballots with multiple forms of identification.\n\nTaylor Fritz, 25, brought the voter registration card mailed to him by the state to cast a ballot at his polling station, the Legacy Park Community Center in Lees Summit. But poll workers there told him the card was not an acceptable form of ID, even though a state website specifically says it is. There was even a poster in the gymnasium where he cast a ballot that stated registration cards were acceptable, Fritz said.\n\n\u201cLucky for me I was able to show my valid state-issued ID,\u201d Fritz, an insurance broker, said in an interview. \u201cThe problem is not everyone has a state ID like me.\u201d\n\nKristen Mitchell, a retired 51-year-old, had a similar experience when she went to vote in Dallas County, in southwest Missouri. She said she saw signs at the polls telling people that photo ID was required to vote. Poll workers told voters they had to have photo ID to cast ballots, she said, and refused to take down the erroneous signs.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nMissouri\u2019s voter ID law, which went into effect in 2017, required voters to show a photo ID at the polls. But if a voter didn\u2019t have an acceptable form of photo ID, they could verify their identity using other documents, such as a bank statement or utility bill. Under the 2017 law, if voters used one of those other forms of verification, they had to sign an affidavit swearing they \u201cdidn\u2019t have a form of identification approved for voting.\u201d In October, Cole County Judge Richard Callahan struck down the affidavit requirement, saying it was confusing. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft appealed the ruling, but the Missouri Supreme Court declined to overturn it.\n\nCallahan\u2019s ruling meant that Missourians did not legally have to show photo ID at the polls on Tuesday and did not have to sign any additional documents swearing they were unable to obtain an acceptable form of ID.\n\nMany poll workers were not clear about the new rules.\n\nDallas County Clerk Stephanie Hendricks said she was unaware of problems at her polling place.\n\nHendricks said the small county had to \u201cscrape the bottom of the barrel\u201d for poll workers, who received only 90 minutes of training. This, combined with the very short notice for the legal change, made it difficult to ensure that poll workers understood the law.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can get people to absorb in an hour or an hour and a half. We do the best we can, but I can\u2019t say it always soaks in,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cThe last few elections it\u2019s been photo ID, photo ID, photo ID, and now all of a sudden the brakes have been thrown on. It\u2019s confusing for people.\u201d\n\nBritt Eubanks, 53, decided to use his U.S. passport to vote in St. Charles because he has had issues voting with his driver\u2019s license in the past. When he presented his passport, Eubanks said a poll worker told him he needed his driver\u2019s license. When Eubanks replied that a passport was acceptable, he said the poll workers told him it would take longer to vote because they would have to enter that ID manually. It ultimately took them a few minutes to enter his information, he said.\n\n\u201cI would like to think it was just lack of training,\u201d Eubanks said in an interview.\n\nSt. Charles County appears to be instructing its poll workers to disregard Judge Callahan\u2019s ruling and has so far ignored demand letters from lawyers at Advancement Project, a civil rights group. Advancement Project attorney Denise Lieberman said the group is considering legal remedies due to the county\u2019s \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d for the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nLieberman said dozens of voters have called Advancement Project with complaints about poll workers, who are reportedly telling voters who present non-photo forms of ID that they \u201cdon\u2019t agree\u201d with the ruling and don\u2019t believe they are required to follow it. Lieberman said the group first sent a demand letter to Rich Chrismer, the local director of elections in St. Charles County, on Tuesday afternoon. He did not respond, and follow-up calls to his office were not returned. A letter to the county\u2019s attorney did not receive a response.\n\nCalls to St. Charles County were not returned. Each time reporters called the county, hold time estimates were greater than one hour.\n\nAdvancement Project also sent Franklin County a demand letter after voters at two polling locations there reported poll workers were refusing to accept non-photo ID. Debbe Door, the Franklin County clerk, said she was surprised to get the letter but immediately called both locations to review the new rules. She said that the late notice made it difficult to impress the rules upon poll workers and that the county was doing \u201cthe best we can\u201d to make sure everyone could vote.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we could given that we were on such short notice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got election judges that are 70 or 80 years old and we threw something new at them without an opportunity to train.\u201d\n\nVoters who called the national Election Protection hotline also reported that poll workers demanded driver\u2019s licenses and rejected other forms of ID allowed under the ruling, and that they pushed back when voters explained that was no longer allowed. Lieberman said her group is seeing the same across St. Charles County.\n\nMaura Browning, a spokeswoman for the Missouri secretary of state, said the state\u2019s top election official has not received many complaints over the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have had very few reports of problems,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThere may have been some confusion in a few of the 3,000 polling places in Missouri, but Judge Callahan\u2019s ruling just 13 days before the election opened up the opportunity for that. Aside from those minor hiccups, the day has gone very smoothly.\u201d\n\nMarc Elias, an attorney with Priorities USA, the group that brought the suit challenging the Missouri law, said that if workers were indeed requiring people to show photo ID or sign an affidavit, they would be violating a court order.\n\nTrey Grayson, who served as Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state from 2004 to 2011, said it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see poll workers confused about voter ID requirements, particularly when there had been a court-ordered change so close to an election.\n\n\u201cI think one of the challenges is that voter ID laws vary state by state,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re always in the news. It\u2019s easy for even well-meaning poll workers to kind of get confused.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "The Election Arrived, But Where The Heck Was The NYT's Election Needle?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyt-election-needle-midterms-vote_us_5be24142e4b0e8438891040f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:46", "body_paragraphs": "Polls were closing, votes were being counted and some races had already been called, but there was one thing noticeably missing from the start of this year\u2019s election night: The New York Times needle.\n\nRest assured, by 10 p.m. EST, the Times\u2019 torture device needle was back in business (and ready to give the anxiety levels of countless Americans an unwanted boost).\n\nPeople of earth!

With a stack of mail-in ballot request forms in one arm, she used the tablet in her hand to identify homes in the area where registered Latino voters live.\n\nAfter almost three months without power and water in their hometown of Manat\u00ed, Puerto Rico, the former pastry chef and her family were able to buy plane tickets and relocate to Altamonte Springs, a suburban city in North Orlando. They spent two months living in a hotel, with the help of FEMA, and moved into an apartment of their own once the aid ran out.\n\nSince then, they\u2019ve struggled to adapt. Sevilla and her son, who has autism, don\u2019t speak English, and the family says they\u2019ve faced discrimination from people who accuse them of wanting to live off the government. Sevilla and her husband grow particularly upset when people, President Donald Trump included, praise hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cHe did do something: He threw toilet paper at us as if we were crap,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cIt makes me angry because there are so many lies that they\u2019re telling and people really believe they helped Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nSo when a fellow Maria survivor told Sevilla about Vamos4PR, she was eager to join their ranks, despite never having been involved in politics in Puerto Rico.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Arleen Sevilla walks by a house with signs supporting Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) while canvassing in Orlando.\n\nPuerto Ricans\u2019 political power is growing in central Florida, becoming an emerging political force since the island\u2019s economic crisis sparked an exodus from Puerto Rico to the U.S. mainland more than a decade ago.\n\nMost of the Latinos that Vamos4PR targets are unlike Sevilla \u2015 longtime U.S. residents who are already registered as either Democrats or independents, but who may not have voted in previous elections.\n\nThe organization is endorsing Democratic candidates \u2015 Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum for governor and incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, whose seat is being challenged by the state\u2019s current governor, Gov. Rick Scott (R). Though canvassers talk about candidates\u2019 stances on a variety of issues \u2015 including universal health care and raising the minimum wage \u2015 Hurricane Maria, and Trump\u2019s response to it, comes up frequently.\n\nHurricane Maria represents an important political event for this voting bloc, which is largely unhappy with the federal government\u2019s response to the storm and has found ways to mobilize in its aftermath.\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t vote at all, this is the first time in many years,\u201d said Pablo Gelabert. The 43-year-old Puerto Rican native has lived in Florida for more than 20 years and had already gone to vote by the time Sevilla knocked on his door. \u201cI have never cared as much as I do right now.\u201d\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Pablo Gelabert stands outside his home in Orlando on Oct. 30, 2018.\n\nGelabert has no family left on the island, but told Sevilla the federal response to Hurricane Maria was \u201cterrible\u201d and that it\u2019s one of the many reasons he supports candidates that are \u201cthe complete opposite of Trump.\u201d\n\nRecent arrivals, by contrast, are not as mobilized to vote and require a more fundamental education on how the political system works in the mainland U.S. On the island, Puerto Ricans can only vote in local elections \u2015 which revolve around a multi-party political system \u2015 and despite being U.S. citizens, they are unable to vote in either presidential or midterm elections unless they reside on the mainland.\n\n\u201cThe focus has tended to be: \u2018Oh, Puerto Ricans are moving from Puerto Rico to the United States. They are U.S. citizens. They can register to vote automatically,\u2019\u201d said Carlos Vargas-Ramos, political scientist and research associate at the City University of New York\u2019s Center for Puerto Rican Studies.\n\n\u201cYes, that is true, in theory. In practice, we know that for the people who were displaced by the storm, voting is not going to be a priority. The first order of priority is going to be to secure housing, and to secure a job to pay for that housing.\u201d\n\nInstead, Vargas-Ramos said, political science research indicates the longer someone has lived in a particular community the more likely they are to turn up to vote.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that the Puerto Rican diaspora in Florida has been growing since deteriorating economic conditions on the island sparked a mass migration in 2006 \u2015 and when Puerto Rican voters show up, they tend to go Democratic.\n\nI usually don\u2019t vote at all; this is the first time in many years. I have never cared as much as I do right now. Pablo Gelabert, 43\n\n\u201cThe raw impact of the Puerto Rican vote in central Florida is significant,\u201d according to Steve Schale, a Tallahassee-based political strategist and Barack Obama\u2019s state director in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to just the 2006 midterm election, the counties that make up the Orlando metropolitan area voted overwhelmingly Republican. Today those counties make up very much the core of the Democratic base in Florida, and it\u2019s a function largely of that Puerto Rican population.\u201d\n\nEdwin Mel\u00e9ndez, director of CUNY\u2019s Center for Puerto Rican Studies, told HuffPost he estimates that in the year after Hurricane Maria, between 67,000 to 73,000 survivors joined the more than 1 million Puerto Ricans already living in Florida. Most of them relocated to central Florida counties like Orange and Osceola where the Puerto Rican population is concentrated.\n\n\n\nVoter registration data in Florida doesn\u2019t include a breakdown of voters by origin, but a recent Pew Research Center study found that Latino registered voters in the state increased by 6.2 percent since the 2016 presidential election. More telling is that registration numbers for Latinos grew fastest in 14 of the 18 Florida counties with the largest Puerto Rican populations.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost Canvassers working with Vamos4PR participate in a training exercise on how to approach people at their homes.\n\nVargas-Ramos estimates that based on census data, Puerto Ricans currently make up about 5.4 percent of the eligible voting population in Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a huge number, but in a race that is very tight, 5 percent may make a big difference at election time,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly voting data suggests that Latino turnout is higher in Florida this election, according to Schale. As of Monday, there were more early votes by Latinos compared to the same period four years ago. Out of the 1 million voters who\u2019ve already voted in this election but didn\u2019t in the last midterm, 18 percent are Latino, Schale added.\n\n\u201cThat says to me that the Hispanic population is bigger but also that turnout is probably a little bit better,\u201d Schale said, adding that there\u2019s been greater turnout among Latinos and Democrats in areas where Puerto Ricans abound. \u201cI think there\u2019s reason to believe turnout among Puerto Ricans is going to be higher than it was four years ago, and there\u2019s a reason to believe that that\u2019s a very good thing for my party.\u201d\n\nBut Alex Patton, a Gainesville-based Republican campaign consultant, told HuffPost that an uptick in early voting numbers could merely be a sign of enthusiasm and holds little predictive power.\n\n\u201cHistorically, [Latinos] are an unreliable voting bloc in midterm elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess the 5 million dollar question is: Do recent events, in the last six months, change that? And we\u2019re getting ready to find out.\u201d\n\nCollaboration Born Out Of Despair\n\nThe federal response to Hurricane Maria continues to be a sore subject for Puerto Ricans in the diaspora. Marcos Vilar, executive director of Alianza for Progress, a political organization working to mobilize Latinos in central Florida, pointed to a series of focus groups the polling firm Latino Decisions conducted in May.\n\nThe report included commentary from long-term residents and recent arrivals and found that the diaspora largely considered the Trump administration\u2019s hurricane relief efforts to be \u201cinadequate at best, and willful neglect at worst.\u201d The participants also said they felt disrespected and forgotten by federal politicians in Maria\u2019s aftermath.\n\nFlorida Senate candidates Scott and Nelson have appealed to Puerto Rican voters by reminding them of their efforts post-Maria. Scott, for example, offered advice and assistance to the island\u2019s Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which struggled to restore power to residents on the island for months. Meanwhile, Nelson worked to advocate for additional aid for both the island and to Puerto Ricans displaced by the storm.\n\nChris McGonigal/HuffPost An information sheet showing political candidates in Florida.\n\nSchale and Vargas-Ramos said there\u2019s no question that Hurricane Maria was key for Puerto Ricans in the run-up to the midterm elections \u2015 both in influencing how they feel about the federal government and how they mobilize.\n\n\u201cThe Puerto Ricans that I do expect to be highly motivated and likely to turn out to vote in this election are the Puerto Ricans that mobilized themselves [in the mainland] to assist those who were displaced by the storm whether in Puerto Rico or in the United States,\u201d Vargas-Ramos said.\n\n\u201cThey banded together and worked collectively to address the situation with Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico and the United States,\u201d he continued, adding that they found both the federal and local response \u201cinsufficient\u201d and that \u201cmany of them are likely to vote to express their opinion about what the governmental response was like.\u201d\n\nEven before the election cycle began, the Trump administration\u2019s feeble hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico had mobilized the diaspora to act and help the island.\n\n\u201cImmediately after the hurricane, people here started collecting goods and money and resources to send to the island, and networks were born out of that effort,\u201d Vilar said. \u201cPeople in Tampa, Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville, Tallahassee discovered each other, bonded and created relationships that sort of launched us into the election.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the hurricane ... People in Tampa, Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville, Tallahassee discovered each other, bonded and created relationships that sort of launched us into the election. Marcos Vilar, executive director of Alianza for Progress\n\nIn the small, baby-blue house in downtown Kissimmee that serves as Alianza\u2019s headquarters, Puerto Rican flags hang on the wall next to maps of the Osceola County voting district and signs featuring a coqu\u00ed frog holding a megaphone next to the words \u201cRespeta Mi Gente\u201d (Respect My People) \u2015 a campaign the group began earlier this year to rally Puerto Ricans and Latinos overall during the electoral cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s under this campaign that about 10 Latino-led organizations, many with Puerto Rican roots like Vamos4PR, are working to reach registered Latino voters and incentivize them to make it to the ballot box. With the help of its partners, the group intended to visit 110,000 central Florida homes three times before Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf we as [Puerto Rican] progressives are not lifting our part, we are hurting the progressive cause, we are hurting other people that need the same things that we need,\u201d Vilar added. \u201cThis way people can say \u2018Puerto Ricans came to Orlando and they made a difference.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarolina Moreno/HuffPost Inside the headquarters of Alianza for Progress in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nA Vote For The Island\n\nPuerto Ricans are also hoping their votes will help their home island. Wanda Ramos, co-founder of Vamos4PR, told HuffPost the group\u2019s mobilization efforts have not only focused on explaining how the mainland political system works, but also how new arrivals can help the island\u2019s reconstruction efforts by voting.\n\n\u201cIn Puerto Rico, we don\u2019t really have representation on the federal level,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have elected officials that have the power to vote to be able to help us. So we have to make the effort to reach those people to create change for the island.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something that weighs on Sevilla and her husband as well. The couple, who will mark their one-year anniversary in Florida on Tuesday, still have a lot of family left on the island and they\u2019re eager to help any way they can.\n\n\u201cNow we have a vote and what we do counts, so we are gonna make the difference,\u201d said Javier Figueroa, Sevilla\u2019s husband. \u201cI don\u2019t like politics, but anything that I can do here that can potentially benefit Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico can count on me. And everything that\u2019s going to benefit all of us Latino brothers and sisters, they can all count on Puerto Rico to support them.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Senate Outlook Darkens for Democrats as Manchin Wins and Donnelly Loses", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/election-day.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:14:50", "body_paragraphs": "\u2022 Here\u2019s what to watch as results come in. | Get live results here.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know right now\n\nWith a major Senate defeats in Indiana and Tennessee, Democrats watched their chances of an electoral sweep diminish even as they retained a seat in deep-red West Virginia with a victory by Senator Joe Manchin.\n\nWhile money and momentum favored the Democrats, the party seized just a handful of the 23 seats they need to take the House in early returns.

For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don\u2019t come with side effects)."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Spanking Is Ineffective and Harmful to Children, Pediatricians\u2019 Group Says", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/health/spanking-harmful-study-pediatricians.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-06 21:15:01", "body_paragraphs": "Effective discipline involves practicing empathy and \u201cunderstanding how to treat your child in different stages in development to teach them how to cool down when things do get explosive,\u201d said Dr. Vincent J. Palusci, a child abuse pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone.\n\nThe academy\u2019s parenting website, HealthyChildren.org, offers tips for disciplining younger and older children. Rewarding positive behavior, using timeouts and establishing a clear relationship between behavior and consequences can all be effective strategies.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just take away spanking,\u201d Dr. Palusci said. \u201cWe have to give parents something to replace it with.\u201d\n\nThe number of parents who spank their children has been on the decline. A 2013 Harris Poll of 2,286 adults surveyed online found 67 percent of parents said they had spanked their children and 33 percent had not. In 1995, however, 80 percent of parents said they had spanked their children while 19 percent said they had not.\n\nAttitudes about spanking are also changing. Although seven in 10 adults in the United States agreed a \u201cgood, hard spanking is sometimes necessary to discipline a child,\u201d according to the 2014 General Social Survey, spanking has become less popular over time.\n\nIn 1970, Fitzhugh Dodson, a clinical psychologist and best-selling author of books on parenting, was quoted in The New York Times as saying that many discipline problems could be solved by using his \u201cpow wow approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pow, followed by his wow,\u201d he explained, demonstrating how he would swat a child\u2019s bottom.\n\n\u201cI know some books say parents shouldn\u2019t spank, but I think it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cA poor mother is left with nowhere to go. She\u2019s mad at the kid, has had it up to the eyebrows with him, and longs to give him a big smack on the behind, but she\u2019s been told she shouldn\u2019t. She should, and it\u2019s good for her, because it releases her tension. And the child definitely prefers it to long parental harangues.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Where \u2018Yes!

Here in Washington, the industry has spent over $20 million to promote Initiative 1634, according to state finance filings. Those fighting the ballot measure have raised $100,000.\n\nStarting last year, legislatures in Michigan, Arizona and California passed laws that pre-emptively bar local governments from imposing such taxes in the future. The outcome in Oregon and Washington, political analysts say, could determine the future of the country\u2019s soda tax movement by encouraging soda companies to embrace ballot measures in states across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment,\u201d said Mark Pertschuk, director of the advocacy group Grassroots Change. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the chilling effect of having soda taxes barred from the whole West Coast, where so many progressive policies are born.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the approach criticize it as overreach. The Oregon initiative, for example, takes the form of a constitutional amendment and critics say it is so vaguely worded that it could be used to block future taxes on restaurant meals, electronic cigarettes, catering halls and trucking companies that transport McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals.\n\n\u201cThese pre-emptive measures undermine democracy and completely take away a local government\u2019s ability to do what\u2019s best for their communities,\u201d said Jennifer L.

Either they were infected before they were immunized or before immunity took hold, or the fever and aches they experienced were side effects of the vaccination, not the flu itself. 2) As currently formulated, the vaccine is far from perfect. In some years, it has been as little as 20 percent effective in preventing the flu, although it may still lessen the severity of the illness and likelihood of complications.\n\nThe biggest problem with flu vaccine is the need to determine months in advance of flu season which of the virus variants to include. The flu virus is a moving target, highly subject to mutations; even the way the vaccine is made \u2014 often involving growing the virus variants in eggs \u2014 can cause them to mutate.\n\nIf the variants included in the vaccine differ from those that are ultimately responsible for seasonal outbreaks, protection is likely to be greatly reduced, which is what happened in the 2004-05 and 2014-15 flu seasons, when vaccine effectiveness was only 10 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Last season\u2019s vaccine was about 36 percent effective.\n\nThere is also a difference in the protection afforded by the same vaccine given to people in different age categories. For example, the vaccine used against flu in 2012-13 had an overall effectiveness of 49 percent, but was only 11 percent effective for people 65 and older. A higher-potency vaccine is now available for older men and women.\n\nThere is now a concerted effort to create a new \u201cuniversal\u201d flu vaccine that would protect against all manner of variants and not require an annual shot. The goal, Dr. Osterholm said, is \u201ca vaccine that can handle many new changes in the virus and that needs to be given only once every five or 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe basic research needed to develop such a vaccine could cost $1 billion a year for the next five to seven years, he estimated. However, Congress allocated a mere $100 million for the coming fiscal year."}]
