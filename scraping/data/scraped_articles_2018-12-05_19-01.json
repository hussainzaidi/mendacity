He had, until now, avoided any encounters with the collected group, and hadn't spoken at all with three of them. He has neither consulted them on issues nor avoided overt criticism of their presidencies, breaking tradition on matters large and small.\n\nFor the time he is inside the cathedral on Wednesday morning, those hurtful slights are likely to remain unmentioned. But few believe the death of President George H.W. Bush will lead to new camaraderie between Trump and the men who served before him.\n\nAs he was shown to his seat, Trump reached over his wife to shake President Barack Obama's hand, who greeted him with a nod. It was their first interaction since Inauguration Day almost two years ago.\n\nMichelle Obama offered Trump a quick \"good morning\" before looking forward. Trump did not shake hands with the Clintons or the Carters, seated several seats away, though first lady Melania Trump extended a hand to greet President Bill Clinton, who smiled warmly.\n\nThe presidents club, by nature, is complicated by past rivalries and future legacies. Yet regardless of party, the members -- so far, all men -- are bound by their singular experience of serving in the Oval Office. It's impossible to know, at this stage of his presidency, what Trump's ultimate role in the club will be. But he enters the group carrying a long record of dismissive, vitriolic criticism extending well beyond partisan politics.\n\nClub of competitors\n\nThe late President Bush was himself a testament to the bygones-be-bygones nature of a club that is composed of political competitors. After Bush's bruising loss to Clinton in 1992, the two men eventually teamed up to lead humanitarian efforts after a devastating tsunami in Asia.\n\nTrump, who maintains grudges going back decades, has shown little interest in developing relationships with his predecessors during his first two years in office, according to those who have spoken with him. He has reached out to them sparingly, including a birthday phone call to the elder Bush two summers ago. When Trump selected Brett Kavanaugh as his Supreme Court nominee in July, he placed a call to George W. Bush, whom Kavanaugh had served in the West Wing as staff secretary. Later, the younger Bush phoned lawmakers to press for Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\nBut until Wednesday, Trump has not spoken to Obama since they parted ways at the East Front of the US Capitol two Januaries ago, where the new President waved off the last as Obama left Washington in a military helicopter. If protocol abides, the two men will be separated by only one seat at the cathedral, filled by first lady Melania Trump.\n\nNeither has he spoken to Clinton or his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, who will be seated a few feet away at Wednesday's service. And he hasn't phoned President Jimmy Carter, though did take notice when the former president suggested the media don't treat Trump fairly, and Trump praised the Democrat in private to his friends.\n\nThat's a break from how presidents have usually interacted with the men who've held the job in the past. Acrimony, even after fiercely contested elections, is usually cast aside or at least aired only in private. Most presidents occasionally consult in some capacity with one or more of their predecessors, usually in private.\n\nBush family and Trump\n\nThe tensions between the Bush family and Trump, which were a recurring theme of the 2016 Republican primary after Trump belittled GOP rival Jeb Bush, roared back into public view after Barbara Bush died in April. She had been highly critical of Trump, saying at one point: \"He's said terrible things about women, terrible things about the military. I don't understand why people are for him.\"\n\nAnd she made clear she did not want him at her funeral.\n\nBut shortly after her body was laid to rest, when it seemed as though her husband's health was failing and his death was imminent, the Bush family reached out to the White House to inform Trump the state funeral for Bush would be different. The former president wanted the current occupant of the office to attend, two people familiar with the conversations said.\n\nIt was less of an olive branch than a sign of the former president's penchant for protocol, a Bush family friend said. The decision also meant that the week of Bush's death would be devoted to a celebration of his life and service, not a messy public feud with Trump.\n\n\"This is a chance for the country to remember -- and learn again -- about 41,\" a Bush family friend said.\n\nTrump, who campaigned as an outsider and has grown accustomed to not being welcomed into several elite clubs and social circles in New York, has indicated that he appreciates the gesture.\n\n\"The elegance and precision of the last two days have been remarkable!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nHe has maintained a gracious and reverent demeanor this week, including traveling late Monday to view Bush's casket lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda and paying a call to Blair House, where the Bush family is staying, on Tuesday. Former first lady Laura Bush and Melania Trump, who have maintained warmer ties than their husbands, toured the White House Christmas decorations\n\n\"In this case, I think that it is important to show the continuity between presidents, that Donald Trump isn't just an individual, he represents the institution of the presidency, which 41 held so dear,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a CNN presidential historian and professor at Rice University.\n\n\"So it's very appropriate that he's there. My concern is strange tweets in the middle of it, because of all the Mueller investigation things coming out. He very well may be behaved during the ceremony and 15 minutes later be writing strange things,\" Brinkley added.\n\nHarsh words\n\nOnly five months ago, the President was mocking Bush's trademark \"thousand points of light\" philosophy of public service during a rally in Montana.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" Trump asked supporters in July. \"Has anyone ever figured that one out? And it was put out by a Republican, wasn't it? I know one thing: Make America Great Again we understand.\"\n\nHe has bluntly said George W. Bush \"lied\" about the Iraq War -- hardly a controversial sentiment among many Democrats, which Trump was for much of his life -- but he took it a step further while campaigning in 2016.\n\n\"Excuse me, the World Trade Center,\" Trump said, a pointed reference to how the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks took place on Bush's watch. Since taking office, Trump has privately derided the younger Bush as \"genius\" for entering the Iraq War.\n\nTrump's most incendiary comments of all come through his inaccurate and racist questioning of Obama's American citizenship. In her bestselling memoir this year, Michelle Obama wrote that the birther conspiracy had made her worry for her daughters' safety (the former first lady canceled book tour events in Europe this week to attend Bush's funeral).\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The New York Times' Maureen Dowd , George H.W. Bush summed up his view of Trump like this: \"He's an ass.\"\n\nStill, the presidents club is like family -- members have little say in who joins.\n\nIndeed, the club runs more on tradition and the forging of personal relationships than on etched rules or guidelines. It's an exclusive gathering that primarily convenes to christen a presidential library or to bid farewell at a state funeral, though George W. Bush made a point of inviting all the former presidents, including his father, to meet Obama as he was entering office in 2009.\n\nThe services for Bush on Wednesday will be the fourth state funeral at the soaring National Cathedral in Washington, with Gerald Ford's in 2007, Ronald Reagan's in 2004 and Dwight D. Eisenhower's in 1969.\n\nBush \"planned his funeral memorial service right to have President Trump attend. But let's be honest -- there's nobody that wants to see President Trump at this memorial service that's going to be there,\" Brinkley said. \"But he's going to be there. And what's going to be interesting -- people will be looking to see who comes up to him, how does everybody act.\"\n\n\"People will have to endure the fact that President Trump is there,\" Brinkley said. \"But it's good that he's there.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: Why Bush wanted Trump at his funeral", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/1hEV5fR4NMU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) George H.W. Bush can perform one last, posthumous service to his country this week by orchestrating a rare moment of unity and a short-term truce in the rancorous politics swirling around the crisis-stricken Trump presidency.\n\nThe remains of the former president, who died at home in Texas on Friday night at 94, will be brought to Washington on Monday to allow the nation to bid farewell to a man whose one-term presidency looks better with each year that passes.\n\nThe ex-commander-in-chief will lie in state at the US Capitol ahead of a state funeral service in Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday that will see a meeting of the world's most exclusive club \u2014 that of former presidents.\n\nFor a few days, a building showdown over a possible partial government shutdown may ease, and the increasing threat posed to the Trump presidency by special counsel Robert Mueller could fade into the background.\n\nDespite antipathy between the Bush family and President Donald Trump, the 41st president made clear he wanted America's current leader to be at the funeral, putting the institution of the presidency above personal animosities.\n\nTrump has confirmed he will attend the event, which follows a series of national disasters and tragedies and moments of public mourning that have caused critics to fault his behavior as short of that expected of a president.\n\nTo his credit, Trump canceled what was certain to be a contentious news conference at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday out of respect for Bush. He also sent one of the iconic blue-and-white 747 jets that serves as Air Force One when a president is aboard to Texas to carry Bush's casket.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina in a gracious tribute.\n\n\"So we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's ceremony still promises to be an awkward moment of political theater for Trump, since he will come face-to-face with former presidents and other top officials whom he has attacked in recent days.\n\nJust last week for instance, Trump retweeted an image that pictures former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, behind bars. Trump often beams at rallies as his crowds chant \"lock her up!\" about the former Democratic nominee. And Michelle Obama wrote in her new autobiography that she will \"never forgive\" Trump for his conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace that launched the real estate mogul and reality TV star's political career.\n\nTrump is likely to come face to face with all four in the National Cathedral before a huge television audience. The encounter will highlight how several of the former leaders, including Obama and Clinton, forged close relationships with their Republican predecessor as well as the friendly relations between them and Bush's son, former President George W. Bush. No such ties exist between that trio and the current President, who often criticizes his predecessors and has given no sign of taking advantage of their advice and experience of doing one of the toughest and loneliest jobs in global politics.\n\nThe President also belittled another of the elder Bush's sons, former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, during the 2016 campaign, and in July, mocked a signature quote by the 41st president about a \"thousand points of light,\" which was later used as the name of his charity.\n\nUnavoidable comparisons\n\nWednesday's state funeral will offer similarities and contrasts to the final farewell for John McCain in September, to which Trump was not invited after mocking the Arizona senator during the 2016 campaign for being shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam nearly 50 years before.\n\nSuch analogies are likely to be perceived again in the tributes to Bush, who was almost universally regarded as a gentleman and a throwback to a more civil and magnanimous era of politics.\n\nStill, with Trump attending, and if he desists from his trademark inflammatory politics, the nation's divides could be papered over, at least for a few days.\n\nBush's passing also looks set to postpone one of the final political showdowns of the year \u2014 a funding controversy entangled in Trump's demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall.\n\nA source briefed on the talks told CNN that lawmakers are considering taking up a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown by a Friday deadline, since Congress will be out of session at the beginning of the week ahead of Bush's ceremonies.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would be open to such a solution.\n\n\"I would absolutely consider it and probably give it,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia cloud darkens over Trump\n\nWashington's period of mourning come at a fraught moment in Trump's presidency, after a week in which it became clear that Mueller is narrowing in on the President as his investigation gathers pace.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller unveiled a cooperation agreement with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen admitted to lying to Congress to cover up the fact that he was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow right up until June 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nHe had previously said talks about the Moscow project ended in January 2016 and said he lied out of a sense of obligation to Trump.\n\nA pair of developments on Friday night appeared to bring the probe even closer to the White House. CNN reported that Cohen believed that Trump would offer him a pardon in exchange for staying on message in in talks with federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump never indicated any such possibility to Cohen. But the report immediately sparked speculation about communications between the two men. Any proof that Trump had offered a pardon in return for Cohen's testimony would be an abuse of power and possibly an impeachable offense.\n\nThen, in a filing later on Friday, Cohen's lawyers offered the clearest sign yet that he kept Trump informed of his efforts to close the deal in Moscow in 2016.\n\nA political hiatus over the next few days might give Trump some brief relief from Russia questions but could also complicate his effort to celebrate an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stave off an escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn exchange, China will buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance, according to a White House statement."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "President Trump's arrival for Bush's funeral", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/vXt9kL7vNJ0/president-trump-arrival-george-hw-bush-national-cathedral-funeral-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

At least a dozen children in Sweden, the United States and Serbia have been born to women with transplanted uteri donated by a living relative, noted the authors of the study , which was published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\n\"The results provide proof-of-concept for a new treatment option for absolute uterine factor infertility,\" wrote co-authors Dr. Dani Ejzenberg, an ob/gyn at the University of Sao Paulo and Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas in Brazil, and Dr. Wellington Andraus, a transplant surgeon at the Sao Paulo University School of Medicine in the study. Less than 5% of women worldwide have some type of \"absolute uterine factor infertility,\" in which an abnormality of the womb interferes with fetal development.\n\nThe Brazilian team followed protocols established by Dr. Mats Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m and his team at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, where the first successful uterus transplant, that one from a living donor, was performed in 2013. That recipient mother gave birth in 2014.\n\nFrom transplant to birth\n\nfor published case studies.) Her diagnosis: The transplant recipient, who had been born without a uterus, was 32 years old at the time of the surgery in September 2016. (The patient's identity remains anonymous, which is typicalfor published case studies.)Her diagnosis: Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome , a genetic condition that affects one in 4,500 women and causes a patient's vagina and uterus to be either absent or underdeveloped, although her external genitals appear normal and her ovaries still function and contain eggs.\n\nMonths before receiving a uterus transplant, the patient underwent in-vitro fertilization. This resulted in eight good-quality early-stage embryos, which were cryopreserved in the hopes of being used after a uterus transplant.\n\nThe donor, a 45-year-old woman who died of a stroke, was deemed a good candidate because she had had three vaginal deliveries during her life, she had no reported sexual disease and her blood type, O-positive, matched that of the recipient.\n\nThe procedure to transfer the uterus from donor to recipient lasted more than 10 hours. The surgery involved connecting the recipient's veins and arteries, ligaments and vaginal canals with the donated uterus. For eight days, the recipient remained in the hospital, where she received five immunosuppression drugs, which control the body's natural instinct to fight off and reject a transplanted organ.\n\nFive months after the transplant, the recipient showed no signs of rejecting the uterus, and for the first time in her life, she experienced menstruation. Ultrasound scans also showed no abnormalities.\n\nAfter seven months of cautious watching and waiting, doctors implanted a single fertilized egg, though in previous uterus transplants, doctors waited a full year to implant. The shorter timetable was intended to reduce patient expenses and risk, because the possibility of the body rejecting an organ can increase over time.\n\nPregnancy was confirmed 10 days later. Throughout the pregnancy, all the usual tests showed a normal fetus with no anomalies. Other than a kidney infection treated with antibiotics at 32 weeks, the mother had no issues during her pregnancy and continued her immunosuppression regimen to prevent rejection of the implanted womb.\n\nA girl weighing nearly 6 pounds was born on December 15, 2017, at 35 weeks and three days -- a late pre-term birth. Ejzenberg and Andraus said Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m's group \"recommended delivery between 34 and 36 weeks due to the risk of restriction of fetal growth due to immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n\nA sonogram shows the baby developing normally within the transplanted uterus.\n\nThe mother delivered via c-section, which included a removal of the transplanted uterus so she could stop using immunosupressive drugs, according to Ejzenberg and Andraus. The organ showed no evidence of rejection, only the usual changes that occur during pregnancy. Both mother and child were discharged from the hospital three days later.\n\nAt the age of 7 months and 20 days when the case study was written, the baby continued to breastfeed and weighed nearly 16 pounds.\n\nThe baby will celebrate her first birthday within two weeks, Ejzenberg and Andraus said. Mother and child have experienced no complications or abnormalities.\n\nThis birth is the first uterus transplant of any kind performed in Latin America and the first using a cadaver organ. Previous attempts at using a cadaver uterus have not resulted in a live birth.\n\nEjzenberg and Andraus said their team's success \"brings hope to other centers that believe in this type of transplant and that have not been successful until [this] moment. It is also a source of hope for patients who do not have a family member or close friend to donate the uterus.\"\n\nWhy this is unique\n\nDr. Andrew Shennan, a professor of obstetrics at Kings College London, told the Science Media Centre that what is unique about this case is that the pregnancy occurred \"in spite of the uterus (womb) being without oxygen for 8 hours before transplant.\" In fact, the new study proves that it could remain functional after cold, oxygen-less storage at least four times as long as the average time after live donation: nearly eight hours, versus less than than two.\n\nShennan, who was not involved in either the transplant or the birth, added that this case \"opens the possibility of women donating their womb following death, as with many other organs.\" And \"rather than relying on live donors, a surrogate or adoption,\" women who are infertile due to uterine factor infertility might soon have another option.\n\nhave occurred in Europe (Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany, and Serbia), they have also been done in Asia, the Middle East and North America. He added that 53 of the transplants involved women born with no uterus. Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m wrote in an email that \"56 uterine transplant procedures have been performed worldwide,\" and although halfhave occurred in Europe (Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany, and Serbia), they have also been done in Asia, the Middle East and North America. He added that 53 of the transplants involved women born with no uterus.\n\nThese transplants have yielded \"13 babies born worldwide\" via uterus transplants, including the birth documented in the new case study, Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m said. His own team conducted a series of transplants in multiple women resulting in several live births.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThough the success of uterus transplants has been proven, Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m said, \"it is important that it also works with a deceased donor, with longer ischemic time and less time to investigate the organ.\" Ischemic time is the amount of time a donated organ remains chilled and without blood flow. The technique still needs to be \"replicated by several teams around the globe\" for further validation, he said.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine recognizes uterus transplantation as a \"successful medical treatment of absolute uterus factor infertility\" yet cautions that the procedure is still \"highly experimental\" in nature. At the time they wrote the study, the authors recorded 10 cadaver uterus transplants attempted or underway in the United States, Turkey and the Czech Republic.\n\nBr\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m, though, feels hopeful and believes that future transplants will not only create new life, they will \"greatly increase the quality of life for parents and grandparents.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "US senator: Saudi crown prince 'ordered, monitored' killing of Khashoggi", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/NTPPGnwJfQ4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Republican senators reacted with outrage Tuesday after leaving a classified briefing about the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, promising swift action to confront both Saudi Arabia and the White House's timid response to the killing.\n\nGOP Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are leading the charge to offer new legislation that would rebuke Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as potentially limit US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, saying their push was bolstered by the classified briefing, which detailed intelligence linking the Saudi leader to the murder of the US-based journalist.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" said Graham, referring to reports that the Saudi team had included a forensic expert who arrived with equipment to dismember Khashoggi's body.\n\nReferring to the prince, who is known by his initials, Graham said, \"You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the command of MBS and that he was intrinsically involved in the demise of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\n'Ordered, monitored'\n\nCorker added that the prince \"ordered, monitored, the killing\" of the father of four.\n\n\"If he were in front of a jury, he would be convicted of murder in about 30 minutes,\" Corker said.\n\nThe strong comments are the latest development in a controversy that has been building over the last two months as the Saudis have offered changing explanations about the disappearance and murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2.\n\nTrump has made a concerted decision to avoid rebuking Saudi Arabia, claiming the kingdom's role in affecting global oil prices and its arms deals with the United States are more important to the national interest.\n\nTrump, as well as Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have downplayed the crown prince's ties to the murder, with Pompeo saying there was no \"direct evidence\" linking him to Khashoggi's death.\n\nNo doubt, senators say\n\n\"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't,\" Trump said last month about whether the crown prince had known about the murder.\n\nBut senator after senator leaving the CIA briefing said there's no doubt that bin Salman was involved, adding that the United States cannot ignore the matter.\n\n\"Somebody should be punished,\" said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama. \"Now, the question is how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation itself? That might be the real policy question.\"\n\nIndeed, after Haspel's briefing, the groundswell of certainty and disgust will likely complicate the administration's efforts to protect the prince and its relationship with Saudi Arabia, even as lawmakers have yet to coalesce around a legislative response.\n\n'It's time'\n\nAmong the options: pull back from US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen; deny any arms sales with Saudi Arabia; slap the crown prince with sanctions, along with a resolution saying the Senate finds him complicit in murder. How the legislative push gets resolved is uncertain, but the floor fight could begin as soon as Monday -- and put the administration on the defensive.\n\n\"It's time for the United States to be out of that war,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat Connecticut who co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution calling for an end to the US role in Yemen. \"I know there are going to be a lot of efforts to try to remove the underlying language and replace it with something weaker. I don't think that ultimately saves lives in the way that the underlying bill does.\"\n\nCorker said he's not certain he would support pulling back from Yemen but that \"I deserve the right\" to back a withdrawal of US involvement in the war effort.\n\n\"I don't want to do anything to harm our national interest, and I don't think that we've fully spoken to what the crown prince has done,\" Corker told CNN. \"There are a lot of issues with Yemen that need to be addressed.\"\n\n'Deep state' concerns\n\nThe CIA, meanwhile, is facing growing pressure to brief the full Senate, since Tuesday's briefing comprised only roughly a dozen senators from the party leadership and who sit on key committees.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, railed at the \"deep state\" for limiting the information flow to senators, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded the full Senate be briefed as soon as possible.\n\n\"While I will not discuss the content of the Haspel briefing, it reinforced the need for a strong response to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\" the New York Democrat said. \"CIA Director Haspel should brief the full Senate without delay.\"\n\nSen.

Scotland's top court, the Court of Session in Edinburgh, had referred it to Strasbourg for a ruling.\n\nThe case was fiercely opposed by the British government, which unsuccessfully argued that the Supreme Court in London should intervene before it went to Europe.\n\nMay told her Cabinet Tuesday that Brexit would not be reversed, a spokesman said. May stressed that the advocate general's findings were not binding on the court.\n\nJolyon Maugham, one of the petitioners in the case, welcomed the advocate general's opinion, urging UK lawmakers to \"search their consciences and act in the best interests of the country.\"\n\n\"The decision is one that the UK can make unilaterally -- without needing the consent of the other Member States. That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives -- where it belongs,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nConservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general and second referendum supporter, told the BBC the decision by the advocate general was \"clearly significant.\"\n\n\"Of course it doesn't necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court and it reinforces something I have to say I personally always thought was probably the case.\"\n\nAsked whether the decision could lead to a second referendum on EU membership, he added: \"It is certainly helpful because it removes one of the arguments which is 'Oh well, they would never allow us to change our minds'.\"\n\nIn his opinion, Sanchez-Bordona said the possibility of the UK unilaterally revoking Article 50 would be subject to \"certain conditions and limits.\" He noted that it must \"respect national constitutional requirements,\" and that would likely mean a vote in the UK parliament.\n\nECJ justices are expected to decide whether to accept the legal advice in the coming weeks. After that, the case will be referred back to the Court of Session in Edinburgh for a final ruling.\n\nThe decision came on the day that Theresa May begins her quest to sell the Brexit deal to lawmakers in the House of Commons.\n\nMPs will spend the next five days debating the deal before a vote next Tuesday, which May is widely expected to lose.\n\nBefore Tuesday's debate begins, May could face another setback, when MPs vote on whether her government should be held in contempt of parliament for failing to publish the full legal advice on her deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Israel begins operation to 'expose and thwart' Hezbollah tunnels", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/I5iiWqEAPFk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Jerusalem (CNN) Israel has launched an operation along its northern border with Lebanon to \"expose and thwart cross border tunnels\" which it says have been dug by Hezbollah, the Israeli army said on Tuesday.\n\nHours after announcing the operation, Israel's military said it had begun work to neutralize such a tunnel near the Israeli town of Metula, which sits right along the border.

The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an Animal Welfare Council to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview.\n\nThe squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.\n\nThe common squirrel monkey , or Saimiri sciureus , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds.\n\nWhen the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked \"gorgeous\" and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment.\n\nBagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.\n\n\"The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"All of these monkeys were born inside,\" she said. \"They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.\"\n\nFor now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.\n\nA 'scientific, ethical and economic' debate\n\nThe monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.\n\nIn the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the US Department of Agriculture\n\nAs for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida.\n\nSome scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.\n\nMatthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in January that \"undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.\n\n\"Animals played a role in the development of each of the top 25 most prescribed drugs in America,\" he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.\n\n\"Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research,\" he said. \"If you love animals, you really should support animal research.\"\n\nWhile visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.\n\n\"The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur,\" he said. \"Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.\"\n\nAdjusting to the outside world\n\nWhen lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.\n\nThat's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.\n\n\"You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside,\" Bagnall said.\n\nFor the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.\n\n\"So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months,\" she said. \"Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.\"\n\nAnother reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.\n\nMeanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.\n\nOak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends.\n\n\"This is unusual,\" said Collins, who has been treating Oak. \"Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is rheumatoid arthritis? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is rheumatoid arthritis? 03:24\n\nOak has been treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and his care team plans to discuss his health with experts at the University of Florida to better understand his medical problem and needs.\n\n\"The kind of disease that this guy has, it flares up, and he obviously has discomfort and some pain associated with it. It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals,\" Collins said.\n\n\"That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species,\" he said. \"So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a \"music hour\" and listened to the soundtrack of \"Forrest Gump\" while playing in their cages.\n\nOak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: \"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.\"\n\nIn that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.\n\nThe road to retirement\n\nThe saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.\n\nThat year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.\n\nAfter learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, it sued the FDA\n\nAbout a month later, world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall penned a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was \"disturbed\" and shocked\" to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb responded directly to Goodall , writing, \"After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.\"\n\nBecause the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday.\n\nIf the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. \"In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.\"\n\nAccording to the FDA's website , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products.\n\nIn January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but \"the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.\"\n\n\"This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research,\" FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.\n\nThe FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming a working group to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools.\n\n\"These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food,\" she wrote.\n\nSome politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.\n\n\"I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home,\" Florida Rep.

Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.\n\nGlobal leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that \"we are in deep trouble with climate change.\"\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThe new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades.\n\n\"The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,\" according to the report.\n\nThe report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nThose recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation.\n\nThe report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies.\n\nGeneral climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.\n\nOnly about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.\n\n'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'\n\nThe new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication . She was not involved in the report.\n\nJUST WATCHED New climate change report issues stark warning Replay More Videos ...

It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.\n\nThe air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area. For instance, \"after the 2017 Northern California fires were out -- Sonoma and Napa were two of the counties -- survivors who did not have a pre-existing respiratory condition were reporting respiratory symptoms still six months out,\" Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"So that's some of what we're seeing,\" she said. \"And that's just one tiny piece\" of this larger discussion around climate change and health.\n\nAs mentioned in the new WHO report, \"at the local level people can make really important changes, and that can help empower communities and in fact make meaningful changes at those local levels that will both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be helpful in improving health and in terms of making cities more livable,\" she said. \"One of the main -- and critical -- messages in this report is that you can't really separate climate changes from health -- both in the short-run and the long-run.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "10-minute cancer test could detect cancer anywhere in the body, new study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/_i_KIM0pCRk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Researchers in Australia have developed a 10-minute test that can detect the presence of cancer cells anywhere in the human body, according to a newly published study .\n\nThe test was developed after researchers from the University of Queensland found that cancer forms a unique DNA structure when placed in water.\n\nThe test works by identifying the presence of that structure, a discovery which could help detect cancer in humans far earlier than current methods, according to the paper published in journal Nature Communications\n\n\"Discovering that cancerous DNA molecules formed entirely different 3D nanostructures from normal circulating DNA was a breakthrough that has enabled an entirely new approach to detect cancer non-invasively in any tissue type including blood,\" said Professor Matt Trau in a statement.\n\n\"This led to the creation of inexpensive and portable detection devices that could eventually be used as a diagnostic tool, possibly with a mobile phone,\" he added.\n\nJUST WATCHED Experimental treatment uses modified stem cells to fight cancer Replay More Videos ...

The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an Animal Welfare Council to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview.\n\nThe squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.\n\nThe common squirrel monkey , or Saimiri sciureus , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds.\n\nWhen the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked \"gorgeous\" and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment.\n\nBagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.\n\n\"The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"All of these monkeys were born inside,\" she said. \"They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.\"\n\nFor now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.\n\nA 'scientific, ethical and economic' debate\n\nThe monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.\n\nIn the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the US Department of Agriculture\n\nAs for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida.\n\nSome scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.\n\nMatthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in January that \"undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.\n\n\"Animals played a role in the development of each of the top 25 most prescribed drugs in America,\" he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.\n\n\"Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research,\" he said. \"If you love animals, you really should support animal research.\"\n\nWhile visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.\n\n\"The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur,\" he said. \"Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.\"\n\nAdjusting to the outside world\n\nWhen lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.\n\nThat's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.\n\n\"You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside,\" Bagnall said.\n\nFor the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.\n\n\"So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months,\" she said. \"Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.\"\n\nAnother reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.\n\nMeanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.\n\nOak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends.\n\n\"This is unusual,\" said Collins, who has been treating Oak. \"Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is rheumatoid arthritis? Replay More Videos ...

It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals,\" Collins said.\n\n\"That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species,\" he said. \"So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a \"music hour\" and listened to the soundtrack of \"Forrest Gump\" while playing in their cages.\n\nOak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: \"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.\"\n\nIn that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.\n\nThe road to retirement\n\nThe saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.\n\nThat year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.\n\nAfter learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, it sued the FDA\n\nAbout a month later, world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall penned a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was \"disturbed\" and shocked\" to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb responded directly to Goodall , writing, \"After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.\"\n\nBecause the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday.\n\nIf the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. \"In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.\"\n\nAccording to the FDA's website , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products.\n\nIn January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but \"the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.\"\n\n\"This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research,\" FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.\n\nThe FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming a working group to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools.\n\n\"These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food,\" she wrote.\n\nSome politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.\n\n\"I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home,\" Florida Rep.

Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.\n\n\"I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory,\" Murray said. \"I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.\"\n\nBailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.\"Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again,\" Mikell Sheehan said.\n\n\n\nBailey Sheehan's physical therapist, Melissa Murray, researched care for children with polio to help Bailey recover from AFM.\n\nLooking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is \"extraordinary,\" according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of \"Polio: An American Story,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.\n\n\"To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that,\" he said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?\n\nThen she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.\n\nIt was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.\n\nShe knew she was in the right place.\n\nSo did the polio survivors.\n\n\"Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.\n\nThe survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.\n\n\"They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'\" Olivera remembers. \"So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!\"\n\nAs Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.\n\nSeeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.\n\n\"Hey, cover that thing up,\" a passerby yelled.\n\nHe was referring to her leg brace.\n\n\"I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!\" remembers Puch, who's now 65. \"I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?\"\n\nShe told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.\n\n\"When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children,\" Puch said.\n\nThat advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.\n\n\"Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all,\" she remembers. \"After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.\"\n\n\"We were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability,\" Erin Olivera said.\n\nToday, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.\n\nNot wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, \" Too Early for Flowers ,\" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAfter the meeting, one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks, since people with paralysis often have cold feet.\n\nThe socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life.\n\n\"That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight,\" she said. \"They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things, too.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Polio-like illness AFM 'appears to have peaked' in US for the year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ytQMolddxHw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The number of cases of the polio-like illness acute flaccid myelitis \"appears to have peaked\" for 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.\n\nIn its weekly update on cases of the illness, the agency said there have been 134 confirmed cases in 33 states this year.

The UK could not force the EU to conclude an agreement bringing it to an end.\n\nThat punctures the government's optimism on the issue. Whereas Article 50 allowed the UK to pull out of the EU, there is no provision for the UK to pull out of the withdrawal agreement. That will pour petrol on the flames of the political debate.\n\nMay defends advice at Prime Minister's Questions\n\nThe prime minister has insisted there can be no Brexit deal without a backstop of some kind to protect commitments made to Northern Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBut she came under fire at Prime Minister's Questions from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford.\n\n\"The legal advice is clear,\" he said. \"It states: despite statements in the protocol it is not permanent, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely. Since the prime minister returned from Brussels with her deal, the prime minister has been misleading the House inadvertently or otherwise.\n\n\"Is it time that the prime minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public?\n\nThe PM told MPs all the material published in the past few days was consistent.\n\nShe said she had made it clear that the UK could not unilaterally leave the backstop plan, so had not been at odds with the legal advice, which made it clear the UK had no sovereign right to withdraw.\n\nBut she insisted the arrangement would, if it came into force, give the UK a number of competitive advantages and therefore the EU would not want the UK \"to be in it any longer than necessary\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: EU makes 'predatory claim' on Northern Ireland\n\nBut the DUP's Sammy Wilson said other EU members would use the backstop as a \"cudgel\" to obtain concessions from the UK in future trade talks.\n\nAnd former foreign secretary Boris Johnson suggested the backstop could easily be dispensed with as it was \"not essential\" to the wider deal and everybody believed \"you can solve this without a hard border\".\n\n\"Let's just get rid of this nightmarish system that keeps us effectively clamped in the EU, and really stopping Brexit from taking place,\" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.\n\nLabour said the legal advice showed the \"central weakness\" of the PM's Brexit deal while the Lib Dems said it would leave the UK trapped in a \"Brexit hamster wheel\".\n\nDebate on Brexit deal continues\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sam Gyimah: Brexit negotiations have been set up for failure\n\nThe second of five days of debate on Mrs May's Brexit agreement is under way, focusing on security and immigration.\n\nThe government suffered three embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, on the role that MPs will play if Mrs May's deal is rejected as well as the disclosure of the legal advice.\n\nEx-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told MPs he could not support Mrs May's deal, saying it was too much of a \"gamble\" to sign up to EU rules when the UK did not know what it was getting in return.\n\n\"We put all our cards and all our money on the table and we wait for another two years for the EU to set the rules of the game.

This will worry scientists as they had seen CO2 emissions relatively flat for the three years before.\n\nSo what's caused the rise?\n\nWhile coal use remains below the historically high level of 2013, it has grown again this year. China, the world's largest emitter saw emissions rise an estimated 4.7%.\n\nAt UN climate talks in Katowice, the lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the rise in China was down to government activity.\n\n\"For the past two years, the Chinese government has boosted the economy and the economy is based on construction and heavy industry, coal and steel. When you boost the economy you actually see a rise in emissions,\" she said.\n\nOther factors include a rise in the US after several years of decline, which the researchers say is due to a very cold winter and a hot summer driving up demand for energy.\n\nWho are the biggest emitters?\n\n2018's top ten has China on top, followed by the US and the EU as a whole region. After these three come India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada.\n\nA booming economy has seen India's emissions grow by 6.3%. Renewables are growing fast but from a low base.\n\nThe five countries contributing most to growth in global emissions outside of China, the US, the EU and India over the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea.\n\nClimate change: Where we are in seven charts\n\nWhat's happening with cars?\n\nOne common factor across rich and poor countries alike has been the continued rise in the consumption of oil in the transport sector. In the EU, the amount of fuel used for flights and road transport has surged by 4%. In US, use of coal actually fell while fossil fuels used in car journeys rose by 1.4%.\n\n\"Apart from the coal story, the emissions from oil use in cars and lorries and trucks and aviation have not been abated at all,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"They just keep rising and rising and that's associated with an increase in cars everywhere around the world.\"\n\nAccording to the experts, people are driving bigger petrol and diesel cars, travelling further than before, in more countries.\n\nWhat does this year's rise in CO2 mean?\n\nImage copyright Robert Alexander Image caption Electric car use is growing, but many think the transition is not happening fast enough\n\nIt's not good news, says the scientists, who argue that global emissions have to start to fall by 2020 if the world is to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nPeople are simply not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris climate agreement was signed.\n\n\"Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are not yet being matched by proportionate actions,\" said Dr Glen Peters, a Research Director at the CICERO Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who led the emissions analysis.\n\n\"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015.\"\n\nHow are people at COP24 reacting to the rise?\n\nIt is being seen here as another warning shot from the real world that negotiators really need to make progress.\n\n\"All the warm words spoken at the UN climate summit in Poland won't help prevent climate change,\" said Mohammed Adow, who's at the conference for Christian Aid.\n\n\"The climate does not respond to lofty rhetoric, it responds to carbon dioxide emission reductions.\n\n\"If this is the most important issue of our time, as leaders repeatedly say, then why aren't they acting accordingly - and showing up for the climate talks?\"\n\nIs anything being done to limit emissions from cars and trucks?\n\nDespite the gloomy picture on cars in 2018, the future is not so solid for the internal combustion engine.\n\nWhile they were rare 10 years ago, there are now three million plug-in cars in use globally.\n\nNorway will stop selling cars that are not electric in 2025. The UK, France, the Netherlands and India say they will stop before 2040.\n\nCar manufacturers are responding to the fork in the road. Volkswagen says it will launch its last generation of petrol and diesel cars by 2026.\n\nThe move has been welcomed but many think it is not fast enough.\n\n\"We simply cannot wait nearly a quarter of a century to phase out the cars warming our climate and making our air toxic,\" said Rosie Rogers from Greenpeace.\n\n\"People living in polluted cities and facing climate change-related disasters deserve better than that.\"\n\nWhere's the good news here?\n\nThe overall growth in green energy has not been enough to keep pace with the rise in emissions - but that bald headline masks some significant progress, say experts.\n\nThe costs of renewables continue to plummet. Morocco, Mexico, Chile and Egypt are now producing solar energy for three US cents or less per kilowatt hour. That's cheaper than natural gas.\n\nMore than 50% of new electricity generating capacity being installed right now is green. Wind and solar are doubling every four years. Coal is going backwards in most of the developed world.\n\nWhile the US may not be staying in the Paris agreement, most US citizens live in a jurisdiction that still supports the Paris goals.\n\nAround the world, some 9,000 cities and municipalities representing some 16% of the world's population are committed to Paris.\n\nOver the past decade, 19 countries including the UK, Ireland, France and the US have all cut emissions while growing their economies.\n\n\"Before 2015, many people thought the Paris Agreement was impossible, yet thousands of people and institutions made the shift from impossible to unstoppable,\" wrote former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, in a commentary on the research.\n\n\"The same is true of decarbonising the economy. Propelled by the pursuit of clean air, jobs and energy-independence among other benefits, the intrepid, collective efforts of young people, civil society, businesses, investors, cities and states are charting the course to net zero emissions by 2050.\"\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\n\nUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018\n\nThe summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions.

It is dated 24 January 2012.\n\nJustin Osofksy (Facebook vice president):\n\n\"Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video... Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. We've prepared reactive PR, and I will let Jana know our decision.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg (Facebook chief executive):\n\n\"Yup, go for it.\"\n\nAndroid update\n\nThe following is part of a discussion about giving Facebook's Android app permission to read users' call logs.

They are going to include the 'read call log' permission... This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it.\"\n\nData leaks\n\nThe following is from a discussion in which Mark Zuckerberg mulled the idea of selling developers access to users' friends' data. It is dated October 2012, pre-dating the quiz involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was sent to Sam Mullin, who was vice president of product management.\n\nMark Zuckerberg (Facebook chief executive):\n\n\"It's not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale. I'm getting more on board with locking down some parts of platform, including friends' data and potentially email addresses for mobile apps. I'm generally sceptical that there is as much data leak strategic risk as you think... I think we leak info to developers but I just can't think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us.\"\n\nMembership fees\n\nThe following is from an email sent by Mark Zuckerberg to several of his executives in which he explains why he does not think making users pay for Facebook would be a good idea. It is dated 19 November 2012.\n\nMark Zuckerberg (Facebook chief executive):\n\n\"The question is whether we could charge and still achieve ubiquity. Theoretically, if we could do that, it would be better to get ubiquity and get paid. My sense is there may be some price we could charge that wouldn't interfere with ubiquity, but this price wouldn't be enough to make us real money.

That is a risk too far\".\n\nBut Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that if the deal was rejected, either the UK could end up leaving without a deal or Brexit could unravel entirely, leaving \"half the nation feeling betrayed\".\n\n\"I take the judgement that when there is a deal on the table that has very, very modest costs to the economy, which will allow us to move on as a nation both economically and politically, I judge that even narrowly, economically that will be in the best interests of the country,\" he told the Treasury committee.\n\nEarlier, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned there was a risk of Parliament trying to \"steal Brexit from the British people\".\n\nHe said there was a \"natural Remain majority\" in Parliament and that any attempts to delay the UK's departure or overturn the 2016 referendum result would be a \"democratic affront\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46457644", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters\n\nThe government has been forced to publish the legal advice given to Prime Minister Theresa May by the Attorney General on the proposed backstop plan, which aims to avoid a hard border in Ireland under all circumstances.\n\nThe backstop, or guarantee, appears in a \"Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland\", which forms part of the UK's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.\n\nIt would only come into effect if a UK-EU trade agreement keeping the border open is not ready by the end of a post-Brexit transition period.\n\nMuch of the advice given by the Attorney General is not new, but it is set out in black and white for the first time.\n\nHere are some excerpts from the six-page document.\n\nThis is a reminder that Northern Ireland would be more deeply entwined in the EU's customs rules and procedures than the rest of the UK.\n\nNorthern Ireland would retain full membership of the EU customs union, while Great Britain would be in a separate customs union with the EU.\n\nThe outcome of this complex arrangement is that the whole of the United Kingdom would be in a single customs territory with the EU.\n\nThat means there would be no tariffs on goods passing between anywhere in the UK and the EU, but declarations would have to be made (not involving any kind of border checks) for goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is a carefully crafted fudge, in other words, with which no-one is entirely happy.\n\nThis section spells out clearly the implications of Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK does not.\n\nAgain, there are no surprises here, but the Attorney General emphasises that, for regulatory purposes, Great Britain would be treated as a third (or separate) country by Northern Ireland.\n\nThat means that for goods crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland (but not in the other direction) regulatory checks would have to take place.\n\nThe EU has conceded that many of them (on things like product standards) could take place online or away from ports or airports.\n\nBut that is not the case for checks on food and animal produce. There are already checks on live animals arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, but this would be a much broader system of controls.\n\nThis point is already clear in the text of the Withdrawal Agreement, but the Attorney General is giving a legal opinion about international law: everyone says the backstop is intended to be temporary, but it could - in theory - remain in place indefinitely \"unless or until\" another permanent agreement takes its place.\n\nThis is only one of several ways in which many supporters of Brexit fear a trap, although it is quite clear that the EU is equally uncomfortable with many aspects of the backstop.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe Attorney General sets out at some length why the EU does not like the backstop either.\n\nIt raises awkward legal questions about the UK (a country that will no longer be part of the EU) being responsible for protecting one of the borders of the EU single market.\n\nIt could also, he suggests, provoke complaints (legal or otherwise) from Irish companies, which might argue that the EU is giving rival companies in Northern Ireland the competitive advantage of full access to both the EU and UK markets.\n\nAnd it complicates the EU's ability to strike future trade deals around the world, because the EU would not be able to define the extent of its customs territory precisely.\n\nIt is likely to be important for the EU, the Attorney General says, that the backstop can be presented as \"a temporary arrangement with a clear and early end\".\n\nAs if there was not already enough concern being expressed about the backstop and the lack of a UK right to leave it unilaterally, this will add fuel to the fire.\n\nIt suggests that the language used in the protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement might allow the EU to suggest that the UK-wide part of the backstop should be abandoned, while keeping Northern Ireland closely tied to the EU.\n\nBut the lack of a unilateral exit clause cuts both ways. If the UK cannot bring the backstop to an end without the EU's approval, then similarly the UK would have to agree to the EU ending it.\n\nIt has been designed deliberately to concentrate minds on a permanent alternative solution.\n\nIn the end, as the Attorney General points out, this is a highly political construction.\n\nBut the prospect of the UK being unable to leave a temporary customs union without a subsequent agreement on the Irish border makes many people extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThis gets to the heart of the problem. The EU believes the only way for the Irish border to remain as open as it is now is for either Northern Ireland or the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union and the single market. And it says it is still waiting for the UK to come up with a credible alternative plan.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "MPs may try to steal Brexit from British people - Liam Fox", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46450227", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:00:42", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liam Fox warns MPs 'may try to steal Brexit'\n\nThere is a risk MPs could \"steal Brexit from the British people\" if Theresa May's proposed deal is rejected, a senior cabinet minister has warned.\n\nLiam Fox said there was \"natural Remain majority\" in Parliament and any attempt to overturn the 2016 referendum vote would be a \"democratic affront\".\n\nIt came after MPs voted to exert more influence should the PM's deal fall.\n\nMinisters will again battle to win over MPs to Theresa May's withdrawal deal after three government defeats.\n\nSecurity will be the focus of the second of five days of debate in the Commons, where Tuesday's marathon session extended into the early hours.\n\nAhead of Prime Minister's Questions at noon, the government published its Brexit legal advice - a move which came after MPs voted to find the government in contempt of Parliament for ignoring a Commons vote demanding publication.\n\nThe PM's deal has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force.

Here's what happened.\n\nWith Westminster in near meltdown over Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn threw the prime minister a curve ball and went on her government's record on poverty.\n\nFor the second week in a row, he quoted a damning report by the United Nations on the government's \"brutal policies\" towards the poor. Was she \"shocked\" by this, he asked, and why had she not replied to a letter he had written to her about it.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn asks the PM if she is shocked by the rising UK poverty in UN report?\n\n\"We don't agree with this report,\" said Mrs May. \"Absolute poverty,\" she said, was at \"record lows\" and \"more people were in work than ever before\". Youth unemployment had almost halved and wages were rising, she added.\n\nMr Corbyn called on her to halt the roll-out of universal credit, which he described as a \"hostile environment\" for benefit claimants.\n\nThe government had \"listened\" to criticism of universal credit and made changes, said Mrs May, and it encouraged people into work and simplified the benefit system.\n\nMr Corbyn quoted a report from the Trussell Trust, the main food bank charity in the UK, which criticised the \"five week wait\" new universal credit claimants face.\n\nPeople in areas where universal credit was being introduced, including Anglessey, Blackpool, Milton Keynes, parts of Liverpool and London, and elsewhere, \"risk being left with no money for Christmas\", said Mr Corbyn.\n\nMrs May claimed \"no one\" will have to wait for money \"if they need it\" because the government had made it easier to get advances and 100% of new claimants would get payments up front.\n\nMr Corbyn dismissed these measures as a \"loan that's offered for some people\". The Trussell Trust was predicting \"record demand\" for food banks this December, he said.\n\n\"Food banks are not just a photo opportunity for Conservative MPs,\" declared the Labour leader, \"all of whom supported the cuts in benefit that led to the poverty in this country\". The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said \"in-work poverty was rising faster than the overall employment rate\", he went on.\n\nWhy did the UK suffer from \"the weakest wage growth of all G20 nations\", he asked the PM.\n\nMrs May accused Labour of wanting to \"go back to square one\" by scrapping universal credit, which would leave people trapped on benefits.\n\nThe Labour leader quoted the chief economist of the Bank of England on wage growth, which prompted an eruption of noise from the Tory benches.\n\n\"The prime minister may be laughing at this, but it's the reality of people's lives,\" cried Mr Corbyn.\n\nSpeaker Bercow stepped in to calm things down, allowing Mr Corbyn to quote another UN report, from two years ago, on the UK government's \"systematic violation\" of the rights of disabled people.\n\nThe government was helping disabled people get into work, said Mrs May, before talking about the \"difficult decisions\" the government had been forced to make by Labour's \"mismanagement\" of the economy, as evidenced by Labour MP Liam Byrne's famous note about there being \"no money left\".\n\nWhenever the PM talks about difficult decisions, said Mr Corbyn, \"the poorest lose out\". He then launched into a full-throated attack on ministers he claimed had labelled disabled people \"scroungers\" and the unemployed \"skivers\".\n\nWhen, he said, would the government scrap the benefits freeze, repeal the \"bedroom tax\", scrap the \"two child cap\" and \"halt the roll-out of of universal credit\".\n\nMrs May replied that the \"poorest lose out when a Labour government comes in\".\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nIt was left to the SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford to lead the attack on Brexit, claiming the government was in \"crisis\" - and urging the PM to take responsibility for \"concealing the facts\" on her deal by not publishing its legal advice until forced to do so by MPs.\n\nHe accused the PM of \"misleading the house, inadvertently or otherwise\", earning him a rebuke from Speaker Bercow - MPs are not allowed to accuse other MPs of lying.\n\nAlright, said Mr Blackford \"perhaps inadvertently\" - prompting another warning from Mr Bercow.\n\n\"There can be no imputation of dishonour and insertion of the word 'perhaps' - he wants to keep his options open,\" said the Speaker. Mr Blackford dropped the \"perhaps\".\n\nThe PM replied that the legal advice was no different to the statement made by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox on Monday.\n\nShe said she had already told MPs there was no unilateral right of exit from the Northern Irish backstop but it is very unlikely to be used, she added.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption SNP's Ian Blackford: \"Brexit deal denies Scottish rights.\"\n\nThe SNP's Joanna Cherry also asked about the PM's Brexit deal.\n\nConservative MP Helen Whately highlighted to women the importance of smear tests.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May on smear tests: \"A few minutes of discomfort could be saving your life\"\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark Darcy's take on the session:\n\nWhatever else happened, this edition of PMQs did not heap further pressure on the prime minister.\n\nOn most occasions, I can see some point in Jeremy Corbyn's approach of talking about bread and butter public services, rather than targeting the issue of the day in SW1 - but with Theresa May under massive pressure, having just lost three Commons votes, and apparently heading for defeat in a vote on the central policy of her government, it seemed rather an odd choice not to pile into the government's woes.\n\nSo while his Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, was tweeting about the unhelpful things the government's own lawyer was saying about her proposed Brexit deal, the Labour leader defaulted to poverty, austerity and universal credit.\n\nImportant issues, to be sure, but the right ones?

This will worry scientists as they had seen CO2 emissions relatively flat for the three years before.\n\nSo what's caused the rise?\n\nWhile coal use remains below the historically high level of 2013, it has grown again this year. China, the world's largest emitter saw emissions rise an estimated 4.7%.\n\nAt UN climate talks in Katowice, the lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the rise in China was down to government activity.\n\n\"For the past two years, the Chinese government has boosted the economy and the economy is based on construction and heavy industry, coal and steel. When you boost the economy you actually see a rise in emissions,\" she said.\n\nOther factors include a rise in the US after several years of decline, which the researchers say is due to a very cold winter and a hot summer driving up demand for energy.\n\nWho are the biggest emitters?\n\n2018's top ten has China on top, followed by the US and the EU as a whole region. After these three come India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada.\n\nA booming economy has seen India's emissions grow by 6.3%. Renewables are growing fast but from a low base.\n\nThe five countries contributing most to growth in global emissions outside of China, the US, the EU and India over the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea.\n\nClimate change: Where we are in seven charts\n\nWhat's happening with cars?\n\nOne common factor across rich and poor countries alike has been the continued rise in the consumption of oil in the transport sector. In the EU, the amount of fuel used for flights and road transport has surged by 4%. In US, use of coal actually fell while fossil fuels used in car journeys rose by 1.4%.\n\n\"Apart from the coal story, the emissions from oil use in cars and lorries and trucks and aviation have not been abated at all,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"They just keep rising and rising and that's associated with an increase in cars everywhere around the world.\"\n\nAccording to the experts, people are driving bigger petrol and diesel cars, travelling further than before, in more countries.\n\nWhat does this year's rise in CO2 mean?\n\nImage copyright Robert Alexander Image caption Electric car use is growing, but many think the transition is not happening fast enough\n\nIt's not good news, says the scientists, who argue that global emissions have to start to fall by 2020 if the world is to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nPeople are simply not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris climate agreement was signed.\n\n\"Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are not yet being matched by proportionate actions,\" said Dr Glen Peters, a Research Director at the CICERO Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who led the emissions analysis.\n\n\"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015.\"\n\nHow are people at COP24 reacting to the rise?\n\nIt is being seen here as another warning shot from the real world that negotiators really need to make progress.\n\n\"All the warm words spoken at the UN climate summit in Poland won't help prevent climate change,\" said Mohammed Adow, who's at the conference for Christian Aid.\n\n\"The climate does not respond to lofty rhetoric, it responds to carbon dioxide emission reductions.\n\n\"If this is the most important issue of our time, as leaders repeatedly say, then why aren't they acting accordingly - and showing up for the climate talks?\"\n\nIs anything being done to limit emissions from cars and trucks?\n\nDespite the gloomy picture on cars in 2018, the future is not so solid for the internal combustion engine.\n\nWhile they were rare 10 years ago, there are now three million plug-in cars in use globally.\n\nNorway will stop selling cars that are not electric in 2025. The UK, France, the Netherlands and India say they will stop before 2040.\n\nCar manufacturers are responding to the fork in the road. Volkswagen says it will launch its last generation of petrol and diesel cars by 2026.\n\nThe move has been welcomed but many think it is not fast enough.\n\n\"We simply cannot wait nearly a quarter of a century to phase out the cars warming our climate and making our air toxic,\" said Rosie Rogers from Greenpeace.\n\n\"People living in polluted cities and facing climate change-related disasters deserve better than that.\"\n\nWhere's the good news here?\n\nThe overall growth in green energy has not been enough to keep pace with the rise in emissions - but that bald headline masks some significant progress, say experts.\n\nThe costs of renewables continue to plummet. Morocco, Mexico, Chile and Egypt are now producing solar energy for three US cents or less per kilowatt hour. That's cheaper than natural gas.\n\nMore than 50% of new electricity generating capacity being installed right now is green. Wind and solar are doubling every four years. Coal is going backwards in most of the developed world.\n\nWhile the US may not be staying in the Paris agreement, most US citizens live in a jurisdiction that still supports the Paris goals.\n\nAround the world, some 9,000 cities and municipalities representing some 16% of the world's population are committed to Paris.\n\nOver the past decade, 19 countries including the UK, Ireland, France and the US have all cut emissions while growing their economies.\n\n\"Before 2015, many people thought the Paris Agreement was impossible, yet thousands of people and institutions made the shift from impossible to unstoppable,\" wrote former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, in a commentary on the research.\n\n\"The same is true of decarbonising the economy.

This counter-balances the shading effects of natural light, making the animal more difficult to see.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurs are interesting because they have many traits in common with dolphins, but are not at all closely related to those sea-dwelling mammals,\" said co-author Mary Schweitzer, professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU).\n\nTheir similar appearance suggests that ichthyosaurs and whales evolved similar strategies to adapt to marine life - an example of convergent evolution.\n\nProf Schweitzer said: \"They have many features in common with living marine reptiles like sea turtles, but we know from the fossil record that they gave live birth, which is associated with warm-bloodedness.\"\n\nCo-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden, told BBC News: \"Blubber is found in living marine mammals but notably also adult individuals of the leatherback sea turtle. Its primary role in all of these animals seems to be insulation, and the leatherback is unique in many aspects.\n\nImage copyright Johan Lindgren / Martin Jarenmark Image caption Comparisons between artificially matured modern porpoise blubber and skin and the equivalent from a fossil ichthyosaur.\n\n\"It has metabolic rates that are higher than are those of typical reptiles, and a suite of measures for heat retention and control, and collectively these enable adult leatherbacks to venture into cold water environments.\n\n\"So, ichthyosaurs were able to control their body temperature at least as well as leatherbacks, but then it is hard to say if they were fully endothermic (warm-blooded) or not.\"\n\nThe researchers identified the blubber and skin remains on a well-preserved ichthyosaur specimen held by the Urweltmuseum Hauff in Germany. It was discovered in Holzmaden quarry, in the country's south-west, which has produced many other well-preserved fossils from the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe fossil was subjected to an exhaustive analysis of its microscopic structure and molecular composition.\n\n\"Both the body outline and remnants of internal organs are clearly visible,\" said co-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden.\n\n\"Remarkably, the fossil is so well-preserved that it is possible to observe individual cellular layers within its skin.\"\n\nThe researchers identified cell-like microstructures which probably held pigment, and an internal organ thought to be the animal's liver.\n\nThe blubber-like material contained fragments of fatty acid molecules.\n\n\"This is the first direct, chemical evidence for warm-bloodedness in an ichthyosaur, because blubber is a feature of warm-blooded animals,\" said Prof Schweitzer.\n\nTo provide additional support for this idea, the researchers artificially matured the blubber of a modern porpoise, exposing it to high temperatures and pressures - as it would be during the process of fossilisation.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: The fossil belongs to a type of ichthyosaur called Stenopterygius\n\nThe resulting \"matured\" porpoise blubber shared many features with the fossilised version.\n\nMost reptiles today are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is determined by the warmth of their surroundings. Blubber's main function is as an insulator to help marine mammals maintain a high body temperature regardless of the ambient temperature of ocean water.\n\nAs for the ichthyosaur's skin, the camouflage pattern would have provided protection from Jurassic predators such as flying pterosaurs, attacking from above, and pliosaurs (even bigger marine reptiles), which would have attacked from below.\n\nDr Lindgren said: \"Given the density of pigment cells, and the fact that they occur in both the epidermis and dermis, we hypothesise that ichthyosaurs had a really dark dorsal (upper) skin, which is also what you see in many extant whales that are deep divers (as ichthyosaurs) and venture into cold, arctic regions (as did ichthyosaurs).\n\n\"A melanic (dark) colouration would benefit ichthyosaurs as a UV protection while at the sea surface, but could perhaps also help ichthyosaurs thermoregulate as is the case in the leatherback sea turtle.\"\n\nLosing the scales and evolving smooth skin would also have helped ichthyosaurs manoeuvre more easily underwater.\n\nJohan Lindgren said the still-flexible skin meant the specimen must have been fossilised so fast that organic molecules were trapped inside the mineral component of the fossil.\n\n\"Soft tissues, such as skin, have hitherto been considered to be so labile (easily broken down) that the only way they can survive is via full replacement by minerals. However, as it turns out, when these minerals are removed, some of the original organics remain,\" Dr Lindgren explained.\n\nThe results are published in the journal Nature.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Game-on for UK's Team Tao in ocean XPRIZE final", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46449806", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Martin Avery Photography Image caption Team Tao's USV: Technologies have had to be developed in just three years\n\nA UK-based team has arrived in Greece for the grand final of a contest to find innovative solutions for seafloor mapping.\n\nThe Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE competition is offering multi-million dollar awards for the best concepts.\n\nParticipants have to chart at least 250 sq km of the Mediterranean at depths down to 4,000m, all inside 24 hours.\n\nTeam Tao, from Newcastle in the north of England, has developed a novel, low-cost, underwater robot.\n\nDeployed and collected by an un-crewed surface vessel (USV), this torpedo-like device is called a BEM, or Bathypelagic Excursion Module.

Six motorcycle taxi drivers are bantering, their bikes parked in upright positions nearby. There are few clients today.\n\nIn an off-campus neighbourhood about 2km from the gate, third-year university student John Chukwu sits on his mattress in a single room in a rundown tenement. Reclining against the wall, he occasionally glances at sheets of paper on the bed as he makes notes. He is trying to solve ordinary differential equations.\n\nBut his room isn't where he should be, at least not in the opening weeks of the semester.\n\n\"I honestly feel terrible,\" Chukwu, a 25-year-old student of mathematics, said. \"The strike by university lecturers is affecting me and other students because nothing is happening on campus.\"\n\nOn November 4, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the union of Nigerian university lecturers, announced it would be going on strike just a year after it suspended its last industrial action.\n\n\"This strike will be total, comprehensive and indefinite,\" ASUU national president, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi, was quoted by local media as saying.\n\n\"Our members shall withdraw their services until the government fully implements all outstanding issues as contained in the memorandum of action of 2017 and concludes the renegotiation of the 2009 agreements.\"\n\nPublic universities\n\nWith this declaration came the closure of more than 90 public universities in Nigeria. For nearly two decades now, the union and the central government have been at loggerheads over several issues including funding, salaries, university autonomy and academic freedom.\n\nThough the government has continually entered into agreements with the union since 2001, university professors say implementation of the terms is slow and, in most cases, their requests are totally ignored.\n\nNigerian students bear the brunt of this long-standing battle between both parties, which fills parents and students alike with dread. At any time, it could mean anything between one week to five months of no education.\n\nWhen Precious Mbah gained admission to study English and literature at the University of Nigeria in October, she was overjoyed. She travelled from the commercial city of Lagos on a 10-hour bus journey to Nsukka, a town in the southeastern Nigerian state of Enugu.\n\n\"I was excited and I look forward to seeing what the lecture hall will look like, what kind of classmates I will be meeting, what my lecturers will teach me and even how the campus environment looked,\" Mbah said.\n\nThe next day she spruced herself up and walked to the Faculty of Arts complex. \"My first day as a student began with the news that there was a strike by lecturers, and I was like what I have been hearing about has finally happened to me,\" the 18-year-old freshman said.\n\nHelplessness\n\nAsked how her she feels about the situation, freshman student of music Linda Okwor struggled to rein in her emotions.\n\n\"I hate to say that my excitement reduced drastically when I found out that ASUU had gone on strike,\" Okwor, 19, said. \"I felt helpless and for the first time I hated this country.\"\n\nAnger and frustration among students can translate into outbursts of indignation towards university staff.\n\nOkwor added: \"Couldn't ASUU have waited for us, freshmen students at least, to know what it actually feels like to be an undergraduate? Is this the 'welcome' they were supposed to tell us?\"\n\nBut the chairman of ASUU branch at the University of Nigeria, Ifeanyichukwu Abada, told Al Jazeera that university employees also have children in public universities who are home because of the industrial action.\n\n\"If you look at the items ASUU is pushing for the government to implement they are of immense benefit to members of the public, not only to ASUU,\" said Abada, also head of the University of Nigeria's political science department.\n\n\"Strikes are not the best option but since we have irresponsible leaders who do not honour agreements it is the only language they understand.\"\n\nAs long as the government continues to renege on its agreement with university teachers, strikes will continue to be a reality for Nigerian students, the union says.\n\nOvercrowded and unhealthy\n\nThese disagreements forced the government to constitute an inter-ministerial committee to travel around the country to conduct an assessment of the issues raised by ASUU. In its report in November 2012, the committee found facilities for teaching and learning were, in its words \"inadequate, dilapidated, overstretched or overcrowded\" and in some cases improvised.\n\nThe report also revealed just 43 percent of Nigeria's 37,504 university lecturers have PhDs. It noted that accommodation facilities for students were overcrowded and unhealthy.\n\n\"These conditions, coupled with the general condition of the universities, produce graduates that lack confidence and sometimes even self-worth,\" the report noted.\n\nThe immediate impacts on students include a disruption of academic activities and a disjointed academic calendar. Once a strike is called off, students have to complete all coursework within a shortened timeframe, meaning they have less time to attend classes and study. Students who should ordinarily spend four to five years in the university sometimes end up staying an extra year or more because of the labour strife.\n\nGovernment authorities have a penchant of threatening to sack lecturers who fail to return to work during industrial action. This often exacerbates tensions between academics and public officials.\n\nPoor working conditions for academic staff have led to a brain drain since the 1980s. Some lecturers have been forced to moonlight as visiting professors in several universities at a time, making them less available.\n\nThe lack of trust in the university system has also fuelled growth in private institutions. At present, there are about 75 of them, mostly owned by churches, businessmen, politicians and wealthy individuals. But most are costly and out of reach for millions of Nigerians.\n\nMore students travel to neighbouring countries such as Ghana, Togo and Benin where they are sure to graduate within the timeframe required for their fields. Some even head to the United States or the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2017, out of 37,735 African students studying in the US, 11,710 were Nigerian - representing 31 percent of the continent's students there - the highest number from an African country.\n\n150901092231928\n\nLow pay\n\nUniversity staff have, as far back as 1973, demanded better wages.\n\nUniversity staff had enjoyed better salaries in the past. However, after the military entered and dominated the political space starting in 1966, things began to change. Military rulers meddled heavily in university affairs, lecturers left the country for better working conditions, causing learning and research to deteriorate.\n\nASUU was formed in 1978 when the brain drain was gaining as much steam as the struggle for university autonomy and academic freedom. In 1988, it organised its first strike, asking the government to address the issue and provide more funding. The military government proscribed the union and tortured and detained some of its leaders.\n\nThough the ban on the ASUU was lifted in 1990, the repressive measures to rein in union members, perhaps, made some more strong-willed. From 1992 until 2013, ASUU has embarked on industrial action nearly every year. The longest strike lasted from July 1 to December 17, 2013.\n\nThat action was a result of the failure of the government to implement a 2009 agreement stating it would improve funding and conditions of service and promote greater university autonomy and academic freedom.\n\nOne of the major issues in the memorandum of understanding signed in 2013 with the federal government involved a yearly fund of $687.5m to be deposited into a special account at the central bank to develop public universities. This was meant to happen every year until the end of 2018.\n\nThe central government has not kept its promise since 2013.\n\nIn September, the federal government approved $62.5m to develop public universities, falling short of the 2013 agreement.\n\nMath student John Chukwu worries the seeming inability of the government to reach an agreement with ASUU could dismantle the new semester.\n\n\"I made plans on how to go about my lectures, personal study and recess hours,\" he said. \"But as it stands now, all of that has got to change owing to the strike.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category":

University of Queensland in Australia have developed a new test that can detect the presence of cancer cells in the body.\n\nThe 10-minute test, announced in a study published by Nature on Tuesday, can determine whether a tumour is present in the human body by identifying a unique DNA nanostructure that is common to all types of cancer.\n\nIt is designed to detect cancer from blood or biopsy tissue by analysing methyl group changes at the genomic level.\n\nMethyl groups, which are tiny molecules of DNA, were found to be significantly altered in cancer patients.\n\nResearchers noted that the methyl groups are spread out across the genome in healthy cells, but were present only in particular places in the genome of individuals with cancer.\n\nMatt Trau, a professor at the University of Queensland, said: \"Discovering that cancerous DNA molecules formed entirely different 3D nanostructures from normal circulating DNA was a breakthrough that has enabled an entirely new approach to detect cancer non-invasively in any tissue type including blood.\n\n\"This led to the creation of inexpensive and portable detection devices that could eventually be used as a diagnostic tool, possibly with a mobile phone.\"\n\nThe new diagnostic test demonstrated an accuracy of up to 90 percent when tested on 200 human cancer samples and normal DNA, according to the researchers.\n\n\"We certainly don't know yet whether it's the Holy Grail for all cancer diagnostics, but it looks really interesting as an incredibly simple universal marker of cancer and as an accessible and inexpensive technology that doesn't require complicated lab-based equipment like DNA sequencing,\" Trau added.\n\nThe technology, however, requires further development as it can currently only determine the presence of cancer, but not the disease type or stage.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists at John Hopkins University in Baltimore analysed more than 1,000 cancer patients who had shown symptoms of cancer, to see whether a similar test, called CancerSEEK, would accurately confirm the diagnosis.\n\nResearchers had discovered that for certain tumours, CancerSEEK was up to 98 percent accurate."},

organised crime group were also being searched.\n\nFive suspects were arrested in the Netherlands, where Dutch prosecutors said the investigation began in 2014 after they noticed money laundering at two Italian restaurants in the south that showed criminal links with Germany and Calabria, home of the 'Ndrangheta.\n\nThe Belgian operations were concentrated on the Limburg area, home to many people of Italian descent who moved there after World War II to work in coal mines, Belgian prosecutors said.\n\nTwo people were also arrested in Luxembourg, and one in Suriname.\n\nOfficials hailed

Brazil.\n\nBut he warned that it was \"just a first step\", saying the arrests were \"nothing for the 'Ndrangheta, there are thousands of people who should be arrested and billions that should be

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

They always want to bring up the fact that I've been very active in closing coal-fired power plants.''\n\n\n\nSteyer on Tuesday turned his focus to voting rights \u2014 one of the \"five rights'' in the platform he released last month \u2014 calling South Carolina the \"perfect place'' to begin that conversation.\n\n\"If you look historically, South Carolina has a long history of trying to make sure that people don't have equal votes,'' Steyer said at the start of the town hall. He called South Carolina a state that, \"whether people here enjoy it or appreciate it or are sorry about it,'' plays an outsized part in the national conversation about the future of the country.\n\n\n\nBoth men have been sharply critical of Trump and agree that he is not fit for the presidency. Steyer, who has amassed a 6 million-person email list from his \u201cNeed to Impeach\u201d campaign against Trump, has repeatedly said Trump is a danger to the country and must be ousted.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Steyer described Trump as \"the most corrupt president in American history who is a basic threat to our system and our safety and to the Constitution itself.'' He said that many politicians, from both parties, \u201cdon't think it's good for their careers to talk about that.''\n\n\n\nBloomberg, however, said, \"It would be a mistake to say anything about that before you see what comes out of the investigation'' being conducted by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into Russian election meddling.\n\nBackers of Democratic candidates\n\n\n\nBloomberg and Steyer spent millions during the 2018 midterm campaigns on behalf of Democratic candidates. Their travel gave them new opportunities to test their message and, perhaps most important, gauge the interest of Democratic primary voters and activists in the potential candidacies.\n\n\n\nIn the Des Moines area, Bloomberg was visiting a community college's wind-energy program and was scheduled to meet with mothers organized to curb gun violence before attending a screening of his climate change film, \"Paris to Pittsburgh.''\n\n\n\nBloomberg contributed $250,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party this year, giving him some claim to gains such as capturing two Republican-held House seats last month.

But the filing's lengthy redactions also underscore how much Mueller has yet to reveal.\n\n\n\nIt was filed two weeks ahead of Flynn's sentencing and just over a year after he became the first of five Trump associates to accept responsibility by pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\n\n\n\nThough prosecutors withheld specific details of Flynn's cooperation because of ongoing investigations, their filing nonetheless illustrates the breadth of information Mueller has obtained from people close to Trump as the president increasingly vents his anger at the probe \u2014 and those who cooperate with it.\n\n\n\nThis week, Trump accused his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, of making up \"stories\" to get a reduced prison sentence after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and also praised longtime confidante Roger Stone for saying he wouldn't testify against Trump.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will now turn his fury on Flynn, whom Trump bonded with during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nTrump has repeatedly lamented how Flynn's life has been destroyed by the special counsel's probe. At one point, he tried to protect Flynn by asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into his alleged false statements, according to a memo Comey wrote after the February 2017 encounter.\n\n\n\nThat episode, which Trump has denied, is among those under scrutiny by Mueller as he probes whether the president attempted to obstruct the Russia investigation.\n\n\n\nFederal sentencing guidelines recommend between zero and six months in prison, and Mueller's office said Flynn's cooperation merits no prison time.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said Flynn's early cooperation was \"particularly valuable\" because he was \"one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight\" into the events under investigation. They noted his cooperation likely inspired other crucial witnesses to cooperate.\n\n\n\nMueller's team credited Flynn with serving 33 years in the U.S. Army, including five years in combat. But prosecutors also said the long military and government service that sets him apart from all other defendants in the investigation made his deception more troublesome.\n\n\n\n\"The defendant's extensive government service should have made him particularly aware of the harm caused by providing false information to the government, as well as the rules governing work performed on behalf of a foreign government,\" they wrote.\n\n\n\nFlynn's case has stood apart from those of other Trump associates, who have aggressively criticized the investigation, sought to undermine it and, in some cases, been accused of lying even after agreeing to cooperate.\n\n\n\nTrump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is accused of repeatedly lying to investigators since his guilty plea. Another Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, is serving a 14-day prison sentence and, though he pleaded guilty to the same crime as Flynn, was denied probation because prosecutors said his cooperation was lacking.\n\n\n\nBut Flynn has largely remained out of the public eye, appearing only sporadically in media interviews or campaign events, and avoided criticizing the Mueller probe despite widespread encouragement from his supporters to go on the offensive. He has instead spent considerable time with his family and worked to position himself for a post-conviction career.\n\n\n\nIn Tuesday's filing, prosecutors emphasized that the conduct Flynn lied about cuts to the core of the investigation into any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nFlynn's false statements stemmed from a Jan. 24, 2017, interview with the FBI about his interactions with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's then-ambassador to the U.S., as the Obama administration was levying sanctions on the Kremlin in response to election interference.\n\n\n\nMueller's office blamed Flynn for other senior Trump transition officials making misleading public statements about his contacts with Russia, an assertion that matches the White House's explanation of Flynn's firing.\n\n\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition team publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between him and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" the filing said.\n\n\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Flynn said members of Trump's inner circle, including his son-in-law and White House aide Jared Kushner, were involved in \u2014 and at times directing \u2014 his actions in the weeks before Trump took office.\n\n\n\nAccording to court papers, in mid-December 2016, Kushner directed Flynn to reach out to several countries, including Russia, about a U.N. Security Council resolution regarding Israeli settlements. During those conversations with Kislyak, Flynn asked Russia to delay or vote against the resolution, a request the Kremlin ultimately rejected.\n\n\n\nFlynn also admitted that later in December 2016 he asked Kislyak not to retaliate in response to the Obama administration sanctions, something he initially told FBI agents he didn't do. Flynn made the request after discussing it with deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, who was at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and being told that Trump's transition team did not want Russia to escalate the situation.\n\n\n\nFlynn was forced to resign his post on Feb. 13, 2017, after news reports revealed that Obama administration officials had warned the Trump White House about Flynn's false statements. The White House has said Flynn misled officials \u2014 including Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 about the content of his conversations.\n\n\n\nFlynn also admitted to making false statements about unregistered foreign agent work he performed for the benefit of the Turkish government, a matter Mueller's team cited in Tuesday's filing. Flynn was under investigation by the Justice Department for the work when he became national security adviser."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Trump Weighs in on Climate Change", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-weighs-in-on-climate-change/4687607.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "\"I'm not going to put the country out of business trying to maintain certain standards that probably don't matter,\" President Donald Trump told VOA when asked about the economic impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nWhen not denying its existence, the Trump administration's approach to climate change essentially comes down to three arguments: the United States has already cut its greenhouse gas emissions more than other countries, regardless of any international agreement; regulations to cut emissions come with high costs and few benefits; and those regulations would put the United States at a disadvantage because other countries will not follow.\n\n\"When you look at China, and when you look at other countries where they have foul air,\" Trump added, \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money.\"\n\n\n\nAs U.N. climate negotiations get under way in Poland to work out rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement -- from which Trump intends to withdraw the United States -- experts weigh in on the administration's claims.\n\n\n\nEmissions cuts\n\n\n\nIt's true that the United States has reduced its greenhouse gas production more than any other country. U.S. emissions peaked in 2005. In the last decade, they have fallen by about 13 percent, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\n\n\nBut the United States was the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases until 2006. And, others have made bigger cuts by percentage. Hungary's levels, for example, decreased 14 percent.\n\n\n\nU.S. emissions started to fall when the fracking boom took off.\n\n\n\nThe new technique of hydraulic fracturing turned the United States into a major natural gas producer. As the price of natural gas has dropped, it has been steadily replacing coal as the dominant fuel for electricity generation. Because burning natural gas produces far less carbon dioxide than coal, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased.\n\n\n\nMore recently, renewable sources such as solar and wind power have started to make inroads on the power grid.\n\n\n\nWhile U.S. emissions have fallen since the 2000s, China's have soared.\n\n\n\nThe country pursued astonishing economic growth with an enormous investment in coal-fired power plants. China is now the leading producer of greenhouse gases by far, roughly doubling U.S. output.\n\n\n\nCost-benefit\n\n\n\nTrump has argued that regulations aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions would hobble the U.S. economy. He has moved to undo the Obama administration's proposed rules on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, among others.\n\n\n\nCritics question whether those regulations would cost as much Trump suggests.\n\n\n\n\"None of these policies were going to have dramatic increases in the prices that consumers would see,\" Duke University public policy professor Billy Pizer said. He added that normal price swings would likely swamp the cost of the regulations Trump targets.\n\nThe emissions reductions the Obama administration pledged in Paris \"were built largely on a continuation of the coal-to-gas transition and a continuation of growth in renewable energy that's already happening,\" said Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute research center. As such, he added, they \"don't imply a large cost. In fact, they imply a marginal increased benefit to the U.S.\"\n\n\n\nThose benefits come, for example, because burning less coal produces less air pollution, which lowers health costs.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the direct results of climate change: wildfires, floods, droughts and so on.\n\n\n\n\"We have enough science and enough economics to show that there are damages resulting from us releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. We know that that is not a free thing,\" University of Chicago public policy professor Amir Jina said. \"And yet, we are artificially setting it as free because we're not paying the price of that externality.\"\n\n\n\nHe said economists nearly unanimously support a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program or some other way to put a price on carbon emissions.\n\n\n\nCollective action\n\n\n\nFew nations have taken the necessary steps to meet the emissions reduction pledges they made in Paris, according to the most recent United Nations emissions gap report.\n\n\n\nTrump's statement -- \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money\" -- sums up why nations are reluctant to act: no one wants to take on burdens that they think others won't.\n\n\n\n\"It's the thing which has been dogging action on climate change for generations,\" Jina said.\n\n\n\n\"We only really solve the problem if everybody acts together,\" he added. \"And if enough people are not acting, then we don't.\"\n\n\n\nParis depends on countries following through on increasingly ambitious emissions cuts.\n\n\n\nEach country decides what it is willing to do. Every five years, countries come together and show their progress.\n\n\n\n\"You over time build confidence in each other,\" Pizer said. \"Ideally, you ratchet up the commitments as you see your actions reciprocated by other countries.\"\n\nTrump's backpedaling on the U.S. commitment raises questions about the prospects.\n\n\n\nHowever, the first of these check-ins is five years away. Trump can't formally withdraw the United States from the agreement until 2020.\n\n\n\nPizer notes that the predecessor to the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, failed in part because it imposed caps on countries' carbon emissions, and most of the world balked.\n\n\n\n\"In my mind, this is the best we can do,\" he said. \"If there were a different way to do it, I'd be all over that.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Gorillas, Given a Puzzle, Find Way to Cheat", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/gorillas-in-experiment-given-a-puzzle-find-a-way-to-cheat/4687346.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Gorillas at a zoo in England have demonstrated a distinctly human trait while attempting to solve a puzzle: cheating.\n\n\n\nThe gorillas were presented with a wall-mounted puzzle that requires the user to guide a peanut through a series of obstacles by poking a stick through various holes.

in the United States, the Czech Republic and Turkey - failed to produce a live birth.\n\nThe girl born in the Brazilian case was delivered via caesarean section at 35 weeks and three days, and weighed 2,550 grams (nearly 6 lbs), the case study said.\n\nDani Ejzenberg, a doctor at Brazil's Sao Paulo University hospital who led the research, said the transplant - carried out in September 2016 when the recipient was 32 - shows the technique is feasible and could offer women with uterine infertility access to a larger pool of potential donors.\n\nThe current norm for receiving a womb transplant is that the organ would come from a live family member willing to donate it.\n\n\"The numbers of people willing and committed to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population,\" Ejzenberg said in a statement about the results.\n\nShe added, however, that the outcomes and effects of womb donations from live and deceased donors have yet to be compared, and said the technique could still be refined and optimised.\n\nThe first baby born after a live donor womb transplant was in Sweden in 2013. Scientists have so far reported a total of 39 procedures of this kind, resulting in 11 live births.\n\nExperts estimate that infertility affects around 10 to 15 percent of couples of reproductive age worldwide.

But overcoming the regulatory hurdles and safety issues posed by drones appears to be a challenge even for the world\u2019s wealthiest man. The result is a blown deadline on his claim to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in December 2013 that drones would be making deliveries within five years.\n\nThe day may not be far off when drones will carry medicine to people in rural or remote areas, but the marketing hype around instant delivery of consumer goods looks more and more like just that \u2014 hype. Drones have a short battery life, and privacy concerns can be a hindrance, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you will see delivery of burritos or diapers in the suburbs,\u201d says drone analyst Colin Snow.\n\nDrone usage has grown rapidly in some industries, but mostly outside the retail sector and direct interaction with consumers.\n\nThe government estimates that about 110,000 commercial drones are operating in U.S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022. They are being used in rural areas for mining and agriculture, for inspecting power lines and pipelines, and for surveying.\n\nAmazon says it is still pushing ahead with plans to use drones for quick deliveries, though the company is staying away from fixed timelines.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to making our goal of delivering packages by drones in 30 minutes or less a reality,\u201d says Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish. The Seattle-based online retail giant says it has drone development centers in the United States, Austria, France, Israel and the United Kingdom.\n\nDelivery companies have been testing the use of drones to deliver emergency supplies and to cover ground quickly in less populated areas. By contrast, package deliveries would be concentrated in office parks and neighborhoods where there are bigger issues around safety and privacy.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration approved a three-year program for private companies and local government agencies to test drones for deliveries, inspections and other tasks.\n\nBut pilot programs by major delivery companies suggest few Americans will be greeted by package-bearing drones any time soon. United Parcel Service tested launching a drone from a delivery truck that was covering a rural route in Florida. DHL Express, the German delivery company, tested the use of drones to deliver medicine from Tanzania to an island in Lake Victoria.\n\nFrank Appel, the CEO of DHL\u2019s parent company, Deutsche Post AG, said \u201cover the next couple of years\u201d drones will remain a niche vehicle and not widely used. He said a big obstacle is battery life.\n\n\u201cIf you have to recharge them every other hour, then you need so many drones and you have to orchestrate that. So good luck with that,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nAppel said human couriers have another big advantage over drones: They know where customers live and which doorbell to ring. \u201cTo program that in IT is not that easy and not cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts say it will take years for the Federal Aviation Administration to write all the rules to allow widespread drone deliveries.\n\nSnow, the CEO of Skylogic Research, says a rule permitting operators to fly drones beyond their line of sight \u2014 so critical to deliveries \u2014 is at least 10 years away. A method will be needed to let law enforcement identify drones flying over people \u2014 federal officials are worried about their use by terrorists.\n\nWhile the rules are being written, companies will rely on waivers from the FAA to keep experimenting and running small-scale pilot programs.\n\n\u201cPeople like DHL and the rest of them (will say), \u2018Hey, we can deliver via drone this parcel package to this island,\u2019 but that\u2019s not the original vision that Amazon presented,\u201d Snow says.\n\nThere is a long list of FAA rules governing drone flights. They generally can\u2019t fly higher than 400 feet, over many federal facilities, or within five miles of an airport. Night flights are forbidden. For the delivery business, the most biggest holdup is that the machines must remain within sight of the operator at all times.\n\nIn June, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said the FAA\u2019s was being overly conservative in its safety standards for drones. The group said FAA\u2019s risk-averse attitude was holding back beneficial uses, such as drones helping firefighters who are battling a fierce blaze.\n\nEven before the criticism by the scientific panel, the FAA had begun to respond more quickly to operators\u2019 requests for waivers from some rules, says Alan Perlman, founder of the Drone Pilot Ground School in Nashville, Tennessee. He said it is also getting easier and cheaper to buy liability insurance.\n\nBezos was mindful of the safety issues, telling \u201c60 Minutes\u201d back in 2013, \u201cThis thing can\u2019t land on somebody\u2019s head while they're walking around their neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from predicting that drones fed with GPS coordinates would be taking off and making deliveries in \u201cfour, five years.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who demanded the briefing with Haspel, said there was \u201czero chance\u201d the crown prince wasn\u2019t involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a smoking gun. There\u2019s a smoking saw,\u201d Graham said, referring to reports from the Turkish government that said Saudi agents had used a bone saw to dismember Khashoggi after he was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. \u201cYou have to be willfully blind\u201d not to conclude that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the crown prince\u2019s command, Graham said.\n\nTrump has equivocated over who is to blame for the killing, frustrating senators who are now looking for ways to punish the longtime Middle East ally. The Senate overwhelmingly voted last week to move forward on a resolution curtailing U.S. backing for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or how that resolution will move forward. The vote last week allowed the Senate to debate the measure, which could happen as soon as next week, but senators are still in negotiations on whether to amend it and what it should say.\n\nHaspel met with a small group of senators, including leadership and the chairmen and top Democrats on the key national security committees, after senators in both parties complained that she didn\u2019t attend an all-Senate briefing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last week.\n\nPompeo and Mattis tried to dissuade senators from punishing Saudi Arabia with the resolution, saying U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict is central to the Trump administration\u2019s broader goal of containing Iranian influence in the Middle East. Human rights groups say the war is wreaking havoc on the country and subjecting civilians to indiscriminate bombing.\n\nThe two men also echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance to blame the crown prince. Pompeo said there was \u201cno direct reporting\u201d connecting the crown prince to the murder, and Mattis said there was \u201cno smoking gun\u201d making the connection.\n\nAfter that briefing, Graham threatened to withhold his vote on key legislation until he heard from Haspel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blow past this,\u201d Graham said. That afternoon, senators frustrated with the briefing and the lack of response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing overwhelmingly voted to move forward with consideration of the Yemen resolution, 63-37.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said the briefing with Haspel \u201cclearly went in to an evaluation of the intelligence\u201d and was much more informative than the session with Mattis and Pompeo.\n\n\u201cI went in believing the crown prince was directly responsible or at least complicit in this and my feelings were strengthened by the information we were given,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nDurbin joined Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in calling for a full-Senate briefing from Haspel.\n\n\u201cEvery senator should hear what I heard this afternoon,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a critic of Saudi Arabia, said that excluding some lawmakers was \u201cthe very definition of the deep state\u201d and that he suspected that the Trump administration was attempting to get some lawmakers to switch their votes on the resolution by giving them information.\n\nKhashoggi was killed two months ago. The journalist, who had lived for a time in the U.S. and wrote for The Washington Post, had been critical of the Saudi regime. He was killed in what U.S. officials have described as an elaborate plot as he visited the consulate for marriage paperwork.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the crown prince must have at least known of the plot, but Trump has been reluctant to pin the blame.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event,\u201d Trump said in a lengthy statement Nov. 20. \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe president has touted Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars to the U.S. and recently thanked Saudi Arabia for plunging oil prices.\n\n\u201cThey have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cThe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the country\u2019s long relationship with Saudi Arabia, senators have said the murder can\u2019t be excused.\n\nIn a column for the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Graham wrote that the killing and other moves by the Saudi regime showed \u201castounding arrogance entitlement\u201d and disregard for international norms.\n\n\u201cWe are a co-equal branch of government exercising leadership to safeguard the country\u2019s long-term interests, values and reputation,\u201d wrote Graham, a frequent ally of the president, of the Senate. \u201cAfter all, someone\u2019s got to do it.\u201d\n\nGraham said after the briefing that he would push for a nonbinding resolution that the crown prince was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Graham and Paul have also said they think Congress should block a pending arms deal with the kingdom.\n\nCorker said senators were trying to figure out how to amend the resolution, which directs the president to remove most U.S. armed forces from hostilities affecting Yemen. He said finding a compromise would be difficult because some lawmakers didn\u2019t want to tie Yemen to the Khashoggi killing.\n\nSenators are \u201ctrying to figure out an amendment that a larger group of people could get behind that addresses this issue without undermining our national interests,\u201d Corker said.\n\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said after the briefing that somebody should be punished.\n\n\u201cNow, the question is, how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation itself,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Senate passage of a resolution would send a strong message to Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s unlikely it would become law before the end of the year. The House hasn\u2019t moved on the issue, and Speaker Paul Ryan last week said the Yemen resolution \u201cisn\u2019t the way to go.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "World's First Baby Born Via Uterus Transplant From Deceased Donor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-womb-transplant-deceased-donor_us_5c075918e4b0680a7eca227c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Handout/Reuters A medical team at Brazil\u2019s Sao Paulo University hospital holds the first baby born via uterus transplant from a deceased donor on December 15, 2017.\n\nLONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) \u2015 A woman in Brazil who received a womb transplanted from a deceased donor has given birth to a baby girl in the first successful case of its kind, doctors reported.\n\nThe case, published in The Lancet medical journal, involved connecting veins from the donor uterus with the recipient\u2019s veins, as well as linking arteries, ligaments and vaginal canals.\n\nIt comes after 10 previously known cases of uterus transplants from deceased donors \u2015 in the United States, the Czech Republic and Turkey \u2015 failed to produce a live birth.\n\nThe girl born in the Brazilian case was delivered via cesarean section at 35 weeks and three days, and weighed nearly 6 lbs, the case study said.\n\nDani Ejzenberg, a doctor at Brazil\u2019s Sao Paulo University hospital who led the research, said the transplant \u2015 carried out in September 2016 when the recipient was 32 \u2015 shows the technique is feasible and could offer women with uterine infertility access to a larger pool of potential donors.\n\nThe current norm for receiving a womb transplant is that the organ would come from a live family member willing to donate it.\n\n\u201cThe numbers of people willing and committed to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population,\u201d Ejzenberg said in a statement about the results.\n\nShe added, however, that the outcomes and effects of womb donations from live and deceased donors have yet to be compared, and said the technique could still be refined and optimized.\n\nThe first baby born after a live donor womb transplant was in Sweden in 2013. Scientists have so far reported a total of 39 procedures of this kind, resulting in 11 live births.\n\nExperts estimate that infertility affects around 10 to 15 percent of couples of reproductive age worldwide. Of this group, around one in 500 women have uterine problems.\n\nBefore uterus transplants became possible, the only options to have a child were adoption or surrogacy.\n\nIn the Brazilian case, the recipient had been born without a uterus due to a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome. The donor was 45 and died of a stroke.\n\nFive months after the transplant, Ejzenberg\u2019s team wrote, the uterus showed no signs of rejection, ultrasound scans were normal, and the recipient was having regular menstruation.

An extensive investigation by the The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Government science laboratory, debunked many of these claims in 2005.\n\nIn his review, Robinson calls the book \u201ca serious challenge for mainstream academics and journalists to start to ask substantial questions about 9/11\u2033 in order to \u201csearch for the facts and speak truth to power\u201d.\n\nRobinson also provided a quote for the back cover of the book, writing: \u201c9/11 Unmasked provides an authoritative and carefully argued exposition of key problems with the official narrative.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by HuffPost UK if he agrees with the conclusions of 9/11 Unmasked, Robinson said in an email: \u201cMy position, as has been the case for some time, is that [conclusions detailed in 9/11 Unmasked] demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that significant parts of the official narrative are very likely to be incorrect.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer tenable for academics and journalists to avoid asking probing questions about the possible involvement of state actors in the 9/11 attacks. 9/11 requires further analysis and investigation and this is a position I share with many other academics.\u201d\n\nRobinson also suggested a number of other academics whose work would allow readers to \u201cget up to speed with geo-politics and the current dynamics of the international system\u201d, one of whom was Kees van der Pijl, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex.\n\nEarlier this month van der Pijl tweeted: \u201cNot Saudis, Israelis blew up Twin Towers with help from Zionists in US govt.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nLydia Wilson, an Oxford and Cambridge research fellow and editor of the Cambridge Literary Review, said this raises serious questions for the University of Sheffield.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that Piers Robinson is teaching propaganda,\u201d she told HuffPost UK. \u201cThe most troubling thing for me is how did he get this job? It\u2019s not hard to uncover this man.\n\n\u2033[The review of 9/11 Unmasked] is conspiracy-theory driven. There\u2019s no academic who should write a post like \u2013 there\u2019s no argument and there\u2019s no evidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to students \u2013 he\u2019s working in a journalism department and he can\u2019t analyse journalism sources.\u201d\n\nRobinson has taught at the University of Sheffield since last year, HuffPost UK understands that his inaugural lecture to students in October 2017 was based on a paper he published around the same time, titled \u201cLearning from the Chilcot report: Propaganda, deception and the \u2019War on Terror\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis paper argues that the ongoing conflict in Syria, which began in 2011, is not the result of the popular uprising known as the Arab Spring, but is in fact the \u201cconsequence\u201d of policies made by former leaders George Bush and Tony Blair in reaction to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nYes, ignorance of the larger picture: Syria is just one regime change in a series initiated after 9/11. Read the article, or Chilcot 3.1 \u2014 Piers Robinson (@PiersRobinson1) July 5, 2017\n\nRobinson uses a number of quotes from the Chilcot Report \u2013 the public inquiry into the origins of the Iraq War, which was published in 2017 \u2013 and other sources, to make the case that the current war in Syria is part of a regime-change plot by western governments, supported by an extensive propaganda campaign aimed at the public.\n\nIn one instance during his lecture and paper, he quotes Blair as saying \u201cthe Middle east is set for catastrophe\u201d as \u201cindicative evidence\u201d the former prime minister knew the region would be embroiled in \u201cbig and significant\u201d western-backed conflict a decade later.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube\n\nIn his email to HuffPost UK, Robinson stood by his interpretation, saying: \u201cRemember Blair and Bush are planning the overthrow of Saddam [Hussein] in these documents plus discussing when to \u2018hit\u2019 Iran and Syria.\u201d\n\nBut the next page of the Chilcot Report, which he does not show to his students, shows Blair was actually discussing offering Iran and Syria \u201chelp and support in building a new partnership with the West\u201d.\n\nDr Yasser Munif, a Lebanese expert on middle eastern politics and society at Emerson College, Boston, told HuffPost UK: \u201cRobinson and people like him are trying to transpose what happened in the Iraq War onto what\u2019s happening with the Arab uprisings of 2011.\n\n\u201cOne of the major problems with his thinking is he completely denies the agency of the Arab population, perceives anything happening in the region as a form of conspiracy.\n\n\u201cHe thinks Arabs have to be manipulated and funded and told exactly what to do \u2013 it\u2019s completely insulting.\u201d\n\nA major part of Robinson\u2019s case for arguing the Syrian war is part of a western regime plot, is a quote from US General Wesley Clark, made in 2006.\n\nAt the time, he described a 2001 encounter with a Pentagon official who alluded to a plan to \u201ctake out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off with Iraq\u201d.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube A slide from Robinson's inaugural lecture at the University of Sheffield.\n\nRobinson claims in his lecture and paper that General Clark was \u201cwas more or less right on the money\u201d and says it is further evidence the conflict in Syria began as part of a western regime change plot.\n\nWhen HuffPost UK spoke to General Clark and informed him of how Robinson was using his quote, he said: \u201cTell him to stop \u2013 the document was written in 2001 so I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Syria in 2011.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t a western regime-change issue.\u201d\n\nRobinson also uses another quote in both his lecture and paper, from a speech by the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove.\n\nSpeaking at the Rusi think-tank in 2014, he describes a pre-9/11 conversation with Saudi Prince Bandar, who told him: \u201cThe time is not far off, Richard, in the Middle East when it will literally be God help the Shia, more than 69 million Sunnis have simply had enough of them\u201d.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube A slide from Robinson's inaugural lecture at the University of Sheffield.\n\nRobinson presents this as further evidence the middle east will be hit by a series of western-backed wars.\n\nBut the next part of Dearlove\u2019s speech, which Robinson does not play to his students, makes clear he is talking about possible Saudi funding for Islamic State, not regime change, as explained by journalist Patrick Cockburn.\n\nWhen HuffPost UK informed Dearlove of how Robinson was using his quote, he told us: \u201d[He] is wildly misinterpreting me.\u201d\n\nIn his inaugural lecture to journalism students, HuffPost UK has also learned that Robinson claims the infamous \u201cMISSION ACCOMPLISHED\u201d banner that hung behind George W Bush when he made his speech declaring the Iraq War over in 2003 was \u201cwas actually imposed over, it wasn\u2019t actually there\u201d.\n\nIn his email to HuffPost UK, Robinson elaborated saying he believed it was \u201cimposed via computer programming overlay in real time, like they do with adverts at football matches and so on\u201d.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Robinson says the banner \"imposed via computer programming overlay\".\n\nRobinson is also a public speaker and regularly shares a stage with and promotes the work of:\n\nMedia on Trial Promotional material from a \"Media on Trial\" event held in London last year. Syrian activists who protested the event were harangued by attendees and accused of working for Israel and the Pentagon.\n\nNader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver, told HuffPost UK: \u201cPiers Robinson and his friends have no interest in truth or justice, they have an interest in propaganda and their propaganda is rooted in a particular worldview that stems from the belief that the only evil in the world comes from the West.\n\n\u201cThe administrators of the university that he teaches at have to be presented with this evidence.\n\n\u201cSomeone who\u2019s supposed to be objective and teaching propaganda is himself a propagandist.\u201d\n\nA University of Sheffield spokesperson, told HuffPost UK: \u201cAcademics in our community share, scrutinise and debate a range of different views based on their areas of research."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Heroic Florida Trooper Pushes Man Out Of Danger And Gets Hit By Car", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-highway-patrol-pushes-man-out-of-danger_us_5c07e3fce4b0a6e4ebdab6b9", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "A selfless Florida Highway Patrol trooper pushed a man out of the path of an out-of-control car, and then got hit by the same vehicle.\n\nTrooper Mithil Patel was released from the hospital Tuesday night, ABC affiliate Local 10 News reported.

The nation\u2019s affordable housing crisis may be contributing to a dearth of available foster families.\n\nAmid an opioid crisis that has increased the need for foster care, states are struggling to find enough foster families to take in kids. A shortage of affordable housing in many places is making the problem even worse.\n\nBut some foster care advocates hope new federal guidelines will make it easier for many foster care parents to get licensed, giving a boost to recruiting efforts, particularly among extended family members.\n\nThe new proposed regulations, which are based on public comments collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this summer and fall, don\u2019t include a square-footage requirement or a minimum number of bedrooms \u2014 rules that many states have enforced for years. Instead, they talk about \u201csleeping spaces\u201d that apartment-dwelling foster families might carve out of their living rooms.\n\nUnder the proposal, the states also would not need to require foster parents to own a car, as long as they have access to reliable public transportation. That change would make it easier for city residents to become foster parents.\n\nMany of the suggested rules are more flexible, and will enable more foster families to get licensed while protecting the safety and well-being of children who\u2019ve already been traumatized, said Ana Beltran, special adviser for Generations United, a Washington-D.C. based advocacy and research group.\n\n\u201cStandards will be more focused on common-sense safety requirements, rather than standards based on some suburban, middle-class ideal of a home, that\u2019s not necessarily the best home for a child,\u201d said Beltran, whose group suggested some of the changes to HHS.\n\nMany foster care advocates and state agencies have praised the new flexibility but also raised concerns in their public comments about some of the proposed rules, including specifics on swimming pool barriers, languages spoken, immunization schedules, transportation options and physical and mental health exams for foster parents.\n\n\u201cThe proposed national model includes standards that will create a barrier for many applicants,\u201d wrote the California Department of Social Services. \u201cAdditionally, due to the critical shortage of available foster homes, we urge HHS to reconsider the requirements \u2026 to encourage, not discourage, those interested in becoming foster parents.\u201d\n\nStates and 12 Native American tribes will have until April to explain how they are aligning their foster care standards to the federal model.\n\nCalifornia and South Carolina already have revamped their licensing standards to make it easier for more families to qualify as foster parents. Last year, in a massive overhaul of its child welfare system, California sped up the process for grandparents and other extended family members \u2014 so-called kinship caregivers \u2014 to become licensed and therefore eligible for the same benefits as non-relative foster parents.\n\nIn 2016, South Carolina increased the maximum number of children that can be placed with a foster family from five children, including the foster family\u2019s own children, to eight.\n\nWashington state child welfare officials also raised the maximum number of children that can be placed in a foster home in an emergency. Now, the state will allow more than six kids in a two-parent foster home when a relative or siblings need to be placed immediately.\n\nArizona lawmakers in January introduced a bill to fast-track licensing for kinship caregivers. The bill, still in committee, includes a provision that would allow child welfare officials to \u201cwaive any non-safety licensing requirement if compliance with the non-safety requirement would be a hardship on the kinship foster-care parent.\u201d\n\nMore Children, Fewer Homes\n\nNationwide, the number of children in foster care is up 10 percent over the past five years, HHS data shows, further straining an already overburdened child welfare system.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, more than half of the states experienced a decline in the number of available foster homes, and between 2017 and 2018, 15 states saw a decline, according to the online news site Chronicle of Social Change, which focuses on children, youth and families. Thirty-one states placed more children in group homes in 2016 than they did in 2012.\n\nLicensing standards for foster families vary greatly from state to state, dictating, for example, the size of bedrooms and the maximum number of children who can sleep in a room. And often those standards are overly restrictive, Beltran said.\n\nFor example, she noted, Arkansas once required that foster families who rent must prove that their landlords don\u2019t object to them caring for foster children. Other states require that foster families have cars \u2014 even in cities with excellent public transit, where having a car is a financial liability, Beltran said.\n\n\u201cThat can be a huge barrier,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cWe consider that to be socioeconomic bias.\u201d\n\nNearly half of all children in Washington state\u2019s foster care system are living with relatives who aren\u2019t licensed, said Ross Hunter, secretary of the Washington State Department of Children, Youth and Families. A license qualifies a caregiver to receive foster care payments.\n\nMost of the time, Hunter said, the relatives\u2019 homes don\u2019t meet the state licensing standards, which require that every bedroom have outdoor egress and access to a hallway or common area. State rules also prohibit creating makeshift bedrooms in hallways, kitchens, living rooms, dining rooms or unfinished basements.\n\n\u201cI can place the kid with a stranger and pay the stranger $700 a month,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t give that same payment to the kid\u2019s grandmother, who could use that money to remedy the housing problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an ungodly Catch-22,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nIrene Clements, executive director of the National Foster Parent Association based in Pflugerville, Texas, said foster families often get into financial trouble when they try to accommodate an additional child by buying a bigger car or a bigger home.\n\nMany foster families expect their homes to be full of foster children all the time, and count on foster care payments to offset the costs, she said. But placements \u2014 and the payments that come with them \u2014 can be erratic. Extra bedrooms might sit empty for months. (Foster care payments vary greatly from state to state, generally ranging between $300 and $900 a child.)\n\n\u201cIn the markets where things are so very expensive, like California, it would be hard for your average person to have a home big enough to accommodate additional children,\u201d Clements said.\n\nHousing Affordability\n\nHigh housing costs prevent many would-be foster families from taking in kids, according to recent research by the Field Center for Children\u2019s Policy, Practice & Research at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn California, child welfare workers in expensive cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles often can\u2019t find local foster families.\n\nInstead, they sometimes place children in other counties or towns where housing dollars stretch further \u2014 but where the kids are separated from their schools, friends and familiar surroundings. Doing so can complicate contact and eventual reunification with their biological parents, officials from Los Angeles County said.\n\nHigh housing costs are an especially strong disincentive for grandparents and other extended family members who don\u2019t qualify for foster care payments because they aren\u2019t licensed, said Ioana Marinescu, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the study.\n\nMarinescu said her research suggests that increasing the financial support from states \u2014 even by as little as 10 percent \u2014 would encourage many more families to take in kids."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Family Says Body Found In Costa Rica Is Missing Florida Woman", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/body-found-costa-rica-missing-florida-woman-carla-stefaniak_us_5a3197b8e4b091ca26851db1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "A missing Florida woman\u2019s family said their worst fears came true Tuesday night.\n\nFamily members said they identified a body found buried behind an Airbnb in Central America as Carla Stefaniak, a Miami woman who vanished while celebrating her 36th birthday there.\n\n\u201cCosta Rican Authorities finally allowed the family of Carla to see the body,\u201d reads a Wednesday morning message on the Finding Carla Facebook page. \u201cCarla\u2019s father confirmed that the body belongs to Carla. ...

From there, the legislation gives landlords until 2050 to double those cuts.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait anymore,\u201d City Councilman Costa Constantinides, a Queens legislator who leads the council\u2019s Committee on Environmental Protection, said at the hearing. \u201cThe time to act is now.\u201d\n\nWaiting, he said, risks leaving \u201cour grandkids the world of \u2018Mad Max\u2019 or the world of \u2018Hunger Games.\u2019\u201d The bill has nearly two dozen co-sponsors, including Council Speaker Corey Johnson.\n\nIt\u2019s a formidable goal from a first-of-its-kind bill that, if passed, would set a new standard for cities around the world and mark the most aggressive climate action yet taken by any municipality, let alone the largest and most economically influential in the nation. But meeting it will be costly, particularly for the real estate industry that dominates New York politics and gave rise to such figures as President Donald Trump.\n\nChallenging the bill outright was never an option. The legislation came from an agreement in August, brokered by the nonprofit Urban Green Council, between the city\u2019s real estate lobby and grassroots activists that set out a framework for cutting emissions 80 percent by the middle of the century. To do so, the agreement outlined a roadmap for requiring landlords to retrofit old buildings with energy-efficient technologies.\n\nAn early draft of the legislation nixed proposals to give extra leeway to New York\u2019s dwindling stock of roughly 990,000 rent-regulated apartments. But the final version unveiled last week surprised activists by not only preserving the protections for rent-regulated units but also going beyond the original Urban Green Council framework to call for cuts to be made roughly twice as fast.\n\nThe timeline for emissions reductions nearly matches the ambition back-to-back reports from federal and United Nations scientists who said urgent action is needed to wean the global economy off fossil fuels and avert catastrophic global warming in the coming decades.\n\nHuffPost New York City Councilman Costa Constantinides, flanked by housing advocates and environmentalists, announces the introduction of his bill in late November, three months after he first said he\u2019d draft legislation to cut emissions 80 percent from big buildings by 2050.\n\nBut the loophole for buildings housing even one rent-regulated apartment \u2015 seen as critical to avoid rent hikes in a so-called Gilded City already facing record homelessness \u2015 could exempt up to a third of the city\u2019s big residential emitters. Instead of requiring expensive retrofits that, even with rent protections, could be legally passed on to tenants in the form of rent increases of up to 6 percent a year, the legislation proposes requiring the same auditing for all buildings over 25,000 square feet that buildings over 50,000 square feet already undergo.\n\nThat appeared to anger industry groups, who demanded their own exemptions, and a handful of their environmentalist allies who said the rent-regulated buildings cannot be left behind as the city reins in the environmental footprint of its skyline.\n\nThe Real Estate Board of New York, the city\u2019s powerful and deep-pocketed landlord lobby, \u201csupports the bills intention to act quickly and with ambition,\u201d said Carl Hum, a senior vice president of the group.\n\n\u201cBut we also want to proceed wisely,\u201d he said, urging a focus on \u201clong-term goals while being cognizant of short-term realities.\u201d\n\nHe said he supports the bill\u2019s call for a study of a carbon-trading market based on Tokyo\u2019s cap-and-trade scheme that allows big commercial landlords in the Japanese capital to buy and sell a limited and shrinking number of CO\u2082 pollution permits. The cap-and-trade market is the only major policy in the world akin to what Constantinides\u2019 bill is trying to do.\n\nFor the Greater New York Hospital Association, the 2022 start date represents an \u201cextremely problematic\u201d and \u201carbitrary timeline\u201d for facilities that stay open 24/7 and require constant lighting and power, according to Andrew Title, the association\u2019s senior government affairs director.\n\nAdriana Espinoza, the New York City program director at the New York League of Conservation Voters, which, with the Natural Resources Defense Council, made up the only major environmental groups opposing the current version of the bill, said, \u201cWe share the concern of others over exemptions for buildings with at least one rent-regulated unit. It is likely these buildings and the New Yorkers who live in them are those who would benefit the most\u201d from retrofits.\n\nWe can\u2019t let deniers and those with deep pockets whose profits are at risk deter us. Mark Chambers, director of the mayor's Office of Sustainability\n\nLooming over the debate is the possibility that the new Democratic majority in both houses of the New York State Legislature next year will pass stronger protections or eliminate Major Capital Improvements \u2015 the program that allows landlords to charge rent-regulated tenants for expensive overhauls \u2015 when rent regulations expire next June. Constantinides said he\u2019d amend the legislation to close the loophole for rent-regulated units if such policy changes occur in Albany in the months to come.\n\n\u201cWe need all sectors to participate in the reduction of greenhouse gases in the city of New York \u2015 no sector can be left behind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want to create a list of exemptions. We want to make sure every sector participates in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nHe asked the five panelists testifying how many have worked with the NYC Retrofit Accelerator, a free program that advises landlords on making energy-efficiency improvements.\n\n\u201cJust one?\u201d he said with a curt chuckle when a lone hand rose. \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nThe accelerator isn\u2019t the only program that could help make the mandated emissions cuts more affordable for landlords. Constantinides sponsored a sister bill to opt New York City into the months-old statewide Property Assessed Clean Energy financial program, which allows building owners to apply for long-term, fixed-rate loans to make energy-efficiency improvements or install solar panels through a voluntary line item on their property taxes.\n\n\u201cWe know that many will need help, real help,\u201d Constantinides said.\n\n\u201cNo one here is pretending this is going to be easy. We know it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we also know, as hard as it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s nothing compared to how hard it\u2019s going to be adjusting to when it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nDespite laser-targeted opposition, the bills enjoy strong support from a mobilized coalition of organizations. Nearly 100 demonstrators rallied on the steps of City Hall an hour before the hearing began. They came from groups ranging from working-class stalwarts, such as Democratic Socialists of America and New York Communities for Change; to climate justice advocates such as 350.org, Uprose and the Sunrise Movement. Their signs and chants localized the messaging Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez helped popularize on federal climate policy, declaring the bills the backbone of a \u201cGreen New Deal 4 NYC.\u201d\n\nHuffPost Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is backing the bill in her home city, framing the building emission cuts as part of the Green New Deal she's pushing on the federal level.\n\nThe stakes for the bill\u2019s passage are high.\n\nFormer Mayor Michael Bloomberg attempted to mandate a building retrofit program in 2009, but the effort fizzled. Current Mayor Bill de Blasio twice attempted to mandate emission cuts from buildings, first in 2016 and then again in 2017. But the efforts went nowhere. In September 2017, the mayor released his most detailed plan yet without coordinating with his usual environmental allies on the City Council, alienating lawmakers who were drafting their own bills to cut emissions. They refused to back de Blasio\u2019s proposal.\n\nBut de Blasio appears to fully back the bill. When Constantinides asked if the bill represented \u201cthe largest emissions reduction policy in the history of this city,\u201d Mark Chambers, the mayor\u2019s sustainability director, cut him off and said, \u201cThe history of any city.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let deniers and those with deep pockets whose profits are at risk deter us,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cThe science is clear, and we have to cut carbon now, and cutting it from the largest source simply makes sense.\u201d\n\nThat could have a huge ripple from a city with a gross domestic product big enough to rank among the world\u2019s 20 largest economies.\n\nIn January, the de Blasio administration sued five major oil companies over infrastructure damage from sea level rise. A federal judge tossed the suit in July, but California and seven other big states signed on to the city\u2019s appeal last month.\n\nWhen the mayor started the process of divesting roughly $5 billion in fossil fuel investments from the city\u2019s pension funds earlier this year, other cities quickly followed.\n\nOver the past month, Ocasio-Cortez took Washington by storm, forcefully rallying current and incoming members of Congress to support her plan to start working on a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal stimulus plan to drastically cut emissions over the next decade and drive up wages by funding renewable energy projects with union wages. But increasing support of that plan beyond the nearly two-dozen lawmakers \u2015 including Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) \u2015 will need to be buttressed by local policies like the Constantinides bill, said Randy Abreu, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s policy director."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "In Stunning Power Grab, Wisconsin Republicans Pass Bill Weakening New Governor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-stunning-power-grab-wisconsin-republicans-pass-bill-weakening-new-governor_us_5c06e268e4b0680a7ec9a289", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Wisconsin state Senate President Scott Fitzgerald (left), Gov.

That presumably would cut down on voter turnout, which generally helps Republicans.\n\nOther provisions would give the Legislature full control of a state economic development agency, block the governor\u2019s ability to write regulations and allow the Legislature to hire its own lawyers to file lawsuits on behalf of the state.\n\nWalker, who narrowly lost to Evers, is expected to sign the package into law.\n\nDemocrats are already threatening to fight the measures in court.\n\n\u201cWe will actively be looking at either to litigate or do whatever else in our power to make sure the people of Wisconsin are represented at the table,\u201d Evers told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.\n\nHe and the other newly elected Democrats take office in early January.\n\nOne change Republicans had considered wasn\u2019t included in the final package \u2015 scheduling the state\u2019s presidential primary for March instead of its current date in April. The GOP had hoped to separate it from a state Supreme Court election that is also on the April ballot. That likely would have resulted in a lower turnout for the April vote, presumably helping a conservative judge seeking re-election.\n\nCritics have portrayed the GOP efforts as a betrayal of November\u2019s election results in which Democrats won not only the governorship but other key statewide offices that Republicans had held."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Rudy Giuliani Goes Full Conspiracy Theorist Because He Doesn't Understand The Internet", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-twitter-conspiracy-theory_us_5c079cb5e4b0fc23611189e9", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Rudy Giuliani pushed out a conspiracy theory about Twitter on Tuesday because he apparently doesn\u2019t know how the internet works.\n\nThe saga began before the weekend when Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer and adviser on cybersecurity issues, inadvertently created a URL with this typo-ridden tweet:\n\nMueller filed an indictment just as the President left for https://t.co/8ZNrQ6X29a July he indicted the Russians who will never come here just before he left for Helsinki.Either could have been done earlier or later.

So\u2026 why did it sill hurt?\"\n\nSex hurts. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told all my life. And if you have a vagina, you\u2019ve probably been told that too.\n\nBut just how much is it supposed to hurt?\n\nIf you Google \u201cis sex supposed to hurt,\u201d as I have a billion times over the past four years, you\u2019ll get lots of different answers. According to Psychology Today, it hurts for 1 in 3 women the first time, and according to Scarleteen and Seventeen Magazine, it\u2019s not supposed to hurt at all, especially after the first time. Notably, most of the top results are blog posts and teen magazines.\n\nWell then, if sex isn\u2019t supposed to hurt at all after the first time, then what in the world is wrong with me?\n\nThe first time I had sex that involved sticking a penis in me was painful. Not just painful \u2015 absolutely excruciating. To be honest, we couldn\u2019t even get it in all the way, and I ended up both laughing and crying because that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be the first time, right?\n\nBut it was just as painful the second. And the third. And the 20th. And so on.\n\nI first realized something was different about my unusually tense vagina while sitting in a circle in my friend\u2019s hot tub at the ripe age of 17. We were exchanging sex stories, because we were, well, 17 and trying to figure out what was \u201cnormal.\u201d One of the girls bravely spoke up, asking, \u201cDoes\u2026 you know\u2026 sex\u2026 really hurt that much?\u201d\n\nI was elated that she asked. Finally, someone was bringing up the pain instead of comparing notes on all the positions they\u2019ve tried and consequently causing me to sink deeper into the water. I sat up tall, splashing the girls around me, and said (more like shouted): \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, I probably terrified her.\n\n\u201cSometimes it still hurts for me,\u201d I added. But it wasn\u2019t just sometimes. It was all the time.\n\nThe first time I had sex that involved sticking a penis in me was painful. Not just painful \u2015 absolutely excruciating.\n\nAnd then my friends shared their stories of how it didn\u2019t hurt that badly, how it went in pretty easily, and I joked that I must just have a tiny vagina, or that I must gravitate toward men with really large penises. We all laughed. And the next time we met up and inevitably the conversation turned to sex, I lied and said it didn\u2019t hurt anymore. Because it wasn\u2019t supposed to, right?\n\nI began to read articles about experiencing pain during sex. I read that painful sex is a lie made up by men who don\u2019t want to take the time to \u201cwarm a girl up.\u201d I read that if you were truly aroused, sex will feel good. That\u2019s probably true for people with normally functioning vaginas, but for me, those articles and thought pieces made me feel completely ashamed and even defective. Because I was aroused, I was relaxed, and it was still painful as hell. I was convinced that something was wrong with the way I was thinking. Was I not turned on enough? If sex is painful for me instead of liberating, am I not a good feminist? I was so ashamed \u2015 ashamed because on the one hand, I was having sex and felt uncomfortable telling doctors or therapists about it. And on the other hand, I was ashamed because I couldn\u2019t do \u201cit,\u201d not all the way, not without it literally feeling like someone was stabbing my vagina with 50 different-size knives.\n\nAfter two years of living through this physical, mental and emotional torture, I finally went to a doctor for a Pap smear. And, honestly, my first pelvic exam was comical. I was so tense that they had to use a pediatric speculum, and even then, it hurt so much they couldn\u2019t get it all the way inside of me. My doctor told me that next time, I would have to take anxiety medication or get a massage before my exam to calm myself down.\n\nI thought to myself, what the hell is wrong with me? I\u2019ve always struggled with anxiety. Sure, I wasn\u2019t exactly relaxed or comfortable during the Pap smear, but it hurt just as much as sex always does for me. And I had already tried everything from massages to aroma therapy to make myself feel relaxed and safe when I was with my partner. So\u2026 why did it sill hurt?\n\nI never got that pre-Pap massage and I didn\u2019t get another Pap until 2 1/2 years later. Why did I wait so long? Shame. I was convinced that the problem was still in my head and that it was just a matter of calming myself down. Of course, that didn\u2019t work.\n\nAfter two years of living through this physical, mental, and emotional torture, I finally went to a doctor for a Pap smear. And honestly, my first pelvic exam was comical. I was so tense that they had to use a pediatric speculum, and even then, it hurt so much they couldn\u2019t get it all the way inside of me.\n\nFast-forward to a few months ago, when I began experiencing abnormally painful cramps during my periods and decided it was a sign that I really did need to make another appointment. Because of the cramps and the pain during sex, I was immediately sent off to a radiologist for a pelvic ultrasound. They put a camera up my vagina during the procedure and \u2015 you guessed it \u2015 it hurt like hell.\n\n\u201cThis is your exam,\u201d the doctor told me. She had a soft voice and listened when I told her about my pain. \u201cWe can stop whenever you want,\u201d she added, the camera not even halfway into my vagina at that point. So, I asked her to stop. I felt like I was being torn in two.\n\nEven though I left that exam feeling somewhat like a failure, I also left feeling empowered. Because for once, the examiner acknowledged that my pain was real. She didn\u2019t tell me to just relax or take a deep breath. She told me that I was in control of the exam and if the pain got too bad, we could stop. And that made me realize that maybe it wasn\u2019t just me being uptight or anxious \u2015 maybe, just maybe, my pain was an actual, physical thing \u2015 and maybe it was something to do with the way my body was made rather than just in my head or related to my level of calmness.\n\nAfter that appointment, I talked to my mom about the pain, something I had never done before. It started off with me joking about how they had to stick a camera up my vagina, and then I asked her if it was normal for it to hurt that much. \u201cDoes it hurt during sex?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not normal,\u201d she said.\n\nI found myself wishing that I had said something earlier because I was finally beginning to realize that what I was experiencing was not just a symptom of my so-called high-strung personality.\n\nWhat I eventually learned is that there\u2019s a word for my condition: vaginismus. It took me four years to be diagnosed, but now that I finally had a name for my condition, I was ecstatic.\n\nEssentially, how I\u2019d describe it is that my vagina can\u2019t relax. Like, no matter how mentally or even physically relaxed I am, my vagina doesn\u2019t follow suit. You know Kegel exercises? I have to learn how to un-Kegel myself, because my vagina spasms involuntarily and gets stuck. Even tampons hurt me. Yes, even tampons. And, no, it\u2019s not just in my head.\n\nLet me paint a picture for you \u2015 I know, I\u2019ve already used the knives stabbing me into pieces analogy, and that might be my favorite, but I can also explain insertion for me as feeling like I\u2019m trying to fit a star-shaped peg into a tiny, round hole. It feels like someone is literally attempting to rip me apart, limb by limb. It feels like there\u2019s a wall in my vagina the size of the one from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and someone is jabbing it with a pickax. It feels like \u201cShark Week\u201d in my vagina. I think you probably get the point by now?\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s treatment. It\u2019s an incredibly long process and I\u2019ve just begun it. In the span of two weeks, I went to three gynecologists, a radiologist and finally a pelvic floor therapist. Currently, I\u2019m seeing the pelvic floor therapist weekly for physical therapy for my vagina, but it\u2019s nothing like the physical therapy I went through when I injured my knee. Every week, I have to sit in a private room and talk about my vagina, do stretches and allow the therapist to stretch my vagina further and further. Additionally, I have homework \u2015 three times a week, I insert a vaginal dilator (which you can find online!) into myself and sit with it inside me for at least 10 minutes.\n\nNot only is this process physically uncomfortable, but it\u2019s also emotionally uncomfortable. Who knows where I\u2019ll be at the end of my 10 weeks with the pelvic floor therapist, but I have my fingers crossed that we\u2019ll be able to make progress.\n\nIt took me nearly four years to seek help for my condition because of the shame I felt about my body, but now I know that sex should not hurt, and if it does, you should see a doctor. Yes, it can be scary and, yes, it can be uncomfortable. But being diagnosed and taking steps to address vaginismus head-on has been life-changing for me, and I\u2019m not even done with treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking to me that I \u2015 and too many other women \u2015 have had to suffer with this condition because we, as a culture, even in 2018, are still afraid of talking about sex and sexuality \u2015 especially for women. The first time I went to see a doctor for this, he didn\u2019t take my pain seriously and attributed it to \u201cjust anxiety.\u201d Continually, doctors minimize women\u2019s pain, especially when it\u2019s pain related to reproductive organs. The only reason I was determined to make more appointments and get the answers I needed was because I had done my own, private internet research about what I was experiencing and finally found others who were going through the same thing that I was \u2015 and more importantly, they were talking about it.\n\nWe need more and better discussions about women\u2019s sexual pleasure \u2015 or their lack of sexual pleasure \u2015 and they need to happen in schools and doctor\u2019s offices too. Think about it: We have ads for erectile dysfunction on cable television, but no one ever mentions vaginismus, and that\u2019s unacceptable. If we had more educators and medical professionals who not only knew more about vaginismus but also were better equipped to talk and teach about it, fewer women would be afraid to admit they might be suffering from it and would take steps sooner to address it.\n\nI hope that by sharing my story, others might relate to what I\u2019ve experienced, and, if they do, hopefully they will find the courage to talk to a doctor about it. And hopefully, one day in the not-so-distant future, there will be more doctors who recognize women\u2019s pain and more people who understand the reality of what it means to be diagnosed with this condition. Maybe one day, instead of labeling women who experience pain during sex as weak or prudish, we\u2019ll acknowledge that their pain is real and can be treated. By doing so, we can empower women to love and honor their bodies in ways they never thought possible.\n\nErin Moynihan is a content writer from Seattle.

Men? We can barely be bothered to use a condom.\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of \u201cThings We Do To Make Dudes\u2019 Lives Unnecessarily Easier,\u201d a clinical trial recently started for a new male birth control gel. All a guy has to do is apply the gel to his arms and shoulders daily for a few months and his sperm count will, in theory, drop to such low levels that producing babies won\u2019t be a concern.\n\nI have thoughts.\n\nFirst off, I\u2019m all for men getting involved in the birth control process. Quite frankly, we don\u2019t rise to the occasion often enough (dad joke completely intended). Guys have been taking a back seat for too long when it comes to contraception \u2015 most expect and assume women will \u201ctake care of\u201d that kind of thing, which is wrong on a whole lot of levels.\n\nWomen are out here getting tubal ligations, allowing contraceptive devices to be inserted into their bodies, undergoing abortions when necessary, and taking daily birth control pills with nasty side effects. Men, on the other hand, can barely be bothered to use a condom (only 19 percent of men use one every time they have sex), and only 9 percent of men opt for a vasectomy when the time comes for a permanent birth control solution.\n\nA vasectomy is the way to go in my book for couples looking for permanent birth control. I went in for my \u201csnip snip\u201d a month ago, and it couldn\u2019t have been a simpler process. Hell, I\u2019ve been on the business end of well-placed knees from my daughters that were more painful than that procedure. When I talk to the average guy about it, however, they get shook and immediately picture castration via butter knife. And it\u2019s rare for guys to be the one to offer up a condom as a birth control option, especially in the moment. Ladies, how often has a man said to you right before sex, \u201cHey, I think we should make a smart decision here and use a condom\u201d? I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t happen, but more often than not it\u2019s women who are the responsible ones.\n\nI\u2019m fully on Team Get Men Involved In The Birth Control Process, but we all know most grown-ass men can\u2019t even remember to put the toilet seat down (guilty as charged).\n\nSo how do we get guys to finally step the hell up and become more active birth control participants? By encouraging them to (at the least) always wear a condom? By educating them on what exactly a vasectomy does and does not entail?\n\nNo. With shoulder gel, apparently.\n\nNow again, I\u2019m fully on Team Get Men Involved In The Birth Control Process, but we all know most grown-ass men can\u2019t even remember to put the toilet seat down (guilty as charged). So I don\u2019t like the odds that they\u2019d remember to rub this gel on themselves daily for 20 weeks (per the clinical trial description) \u2015 only after that can the gel be used as an effective method of contraception. I picture guys applying this stuff once or twice a week, convincing themselves they\u2019re shooting blanks, and then wondering why there are so many tiny humans running around who look just like them. And I doubt many women would feel inclined to trust their partner to apply the gel daily, since women are ultimately the ones who have to bear the burden of an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nI also question the likelihood the average dude would actually be willing to use the gel, given that the point of it is to basically render a man temporarily infertile through the lowering of sperm count. Why? Because many of us have completely irrational fears when it comes to our junk and how it performs since it\u2019s tied to how we\u2019re viewed as men. That\u2019s why guys don\u2019t go around talking about erectile dysfunction the way they talk about how many times they\u2019ve had sex. If this gel someday came to market, I predict many dudes would give it a pass, worried their hard drives would turn into floppy disks after a few sperm suppressor rubdowns (even though it\u2019s designed to not affect testosterone levels). Yes, I know sperm count isn\u2019t directly correlated to sexual performance \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s called an irrational fear. But these thoughts will cross the minds of many men, I\u2019m sure.\n\nIf we injected the average guy with a truth serum and asked him what a perfect form of contraception would look like, he\u2019d probably say, \u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t involve me.\u201d That trend has to stop, and for these men, this birth control gel might actually be a worthy contender. It\u2019s apparently painless, and everything happens above the belt, which is exactly what most men want (or demand) when it comes to this sort of thing. That said, you better hope you\u2019re the kind of guy who remembers to apply it daily...\n\nIf we injected the average guy with a truth serum and asked him what a perfect form of contraception would look like, he\u2019d probably say, 'Anything that doesn\u2019t involve me.'\n\nFor these reasons, I\u2019m not convinced this form of male contraception will catch on right away (assuming it survives the full regulatory process \u2015 the clinical trial won\u2019t even be finished until 2022, and that\u2019s just one step of many). As far as I\u2019m concerned, a vasectomy is still the best form of male birth control for those who seek a permanent option. After a weekend of sitting around watching television with frozen peas between your legs, you\u2019re pretty much good as new. But hey, I\u2019m a part of that 9 percent of men. The vast majority of guys won\u2019t consider going under the knife for the sake of being a team player, so the medical establishment is now having to find ways to cater to these cowards \u2026 er, gentlemen ... who seek other options.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal, fellas: We\u2019re putting way too much responsibility on women. Let\u2019s throw them a damn bone by at least being active participants in the birth control process. It\u2019s really not that complicated. Good ol\u2019 fashioned condoms and vasectomies are solid options and are available right in front of us right now. Stepping up and actually using them is the best way to show your partner love and respect.\n\nBut I\u2019m not naive enough to believe all men will heed this message, so prepare yourselves, ladies. Because if this male birth control gel actually hits the market someday, don\u2019t be surprised if he asks you to be the one to rub it into his arms and shoulders. Because life \u2015 and contraception \u2015 is really tough for us dudes, you know."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Takes Credit For Yoga Boom.

She swept her hair up in a bun. She thought her outfits were neat and even more professional than those of some of her colleagues, who sometimes wore flip-flops and yoga pants. Bramblette has two master\u2019s degrees, and her problem-solving skills were so renowned at the office, a co-worker once said she had a magic wand. She believed she was qualified.\n\nShe took her supervisor\u2019s words to heart and began dressing up more, wearing formal blouses and taking time every day to curl or French braid her hair. Her landlord stopped her once on her way to work and asked if she had a fancy date later that night.\n\nNone of it mattered. In her year-end review, Bramblette\u2019s supervisor again noted her clothing, saying she would like to see her wear \u201cmore formal and professional\u201d attire.\n\nAt that point, Bramblette became convinced the issue was not her clothing but her size. At the time, she weighed about 350 pounds, and she has lipedema and lymphedema, which cause localized swelling in her arms and legs. As an obese woman in America, she was used to feeling that other people\u2019s judgment of her size was a mostly unspoken but ever-present obstacle, slowing down any kind of career momentum.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked about getting a promotion, the first thing they commented on was my appearance. She didn\u2019t give me any other feedback,\u201d said Bramblette, who quit soon afterward. \u201cMy appearance is my weight. There is no way around that.\u201d\n\nSarah Bramblette Sarah Bramblette, in an outfit she said was typical of what she wore to work when her supervisor called out her attire.\n\nStrict Scrutiny\n\nThe majority of adults in this country are overweight or obese, and bias against them is demonstrably increasing. Research shows weight discrimination has increased by 66 percent in the past decade and is, by some estimates, as prevalent as racial discrimination. The stigma of being fat follows Americans everywhere: at home, in medical settings, at school and at work, where discrimination is rampant \u2014 and perfectly legal.\n\nThe problem is particularly pernicious for female employees, who sit at a toxic intersection of gender and fat discrimination. Women are more likely than men to be judged on their appearances in the workplace and to have that factored into job development decisions such as hiring and promotion. Meanwhile, fat people of all genders pay a price at every stage of the employment process. They have lower starting salaries and are seen as less qualified while generally putting in longer hours than thinner employees. It is not surprising, then, that fat women experience employment discrimination at eye-popping rates.\n\nWomen affected by obesity face a steep wage penalty, tending to earn 6 percent less than thinner women, by some estimates, while overweight men tend to earn about 3 percent less than their thinner counterparts.\n\nThose women know they\u2019re being discriminated against too. In one study of more than 2,400 overweight and obese women, 43 percent said they had been stigmatized by their employers or supervisors because of their weight, and 54 percent said colleagues had done the same.\n\nResearch also suggests it affects not only workplace decision-making but also individual colleague relationships. In one study, more than 90 percent of women who said they had been discriminated against at work because of their weight reported being left out of social events, compared with just 8 percent of men who said they had experienced weight-related stigma of some kind.\n\n\u201cWe know that women are highly scrutinized for physical appearance in our society, that we have these very stringent ideals of what it means to be attractive and that if women deviate from these ideals \u2014 even a little bit \u2014 they become vulnerable to criticism and unfair judgment and stigma,\u201d said Rebecca Puhl, the deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut.\n\nWeight discrimination in the workplace is an issue of social justice, to be sure, but it also has deep psychological roots that are insidious and difficult to sniff out. One startling experiment \u2014 which asked participants to look at photographs of hypothetical political candidates and gauge them on a range of characteristics, including likability and competence \u2014 found that obese female candidates scored worse than ones who were not obese but that obese male candidates scored better.\n\n\u201cThere are now many types of evidence that exist,\u201d Puhl said. \u201cPerception is one thing ... and that\u2019s very valid research, and we need to be sure that we don\u2019t discount that, but we also have these very clear experimental studies where we can isolate cause and effect and look at evaluations of job applicants when the only thing that differs is body weight. And that really allows us to make these kinds of observations that tell us yes, this is discriminatory.\u201d\n\nEnduring Stigma\n\nShockingly, weight-based discrimination is, by and large, perfectly legal.\n\nMichigan is the only state in the country that has a law, on the books since the 1970s, explicitly prohibiting employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of weight, and a few cities around the country have similar measures. Federal laws prohibit discrimination based on other protected classes \u2014 such as age, gender, race, religion and disability \u2014 but not weight, and individuals who attempt to bring lawsuits under the Americans With Disabilities Act must show their weight is a disability, which is certainly not always the case. (In 2009 the ADA was expanded to include \u201csevere obesity\u201d as a covered disability.)\n\nSome states, like Massachusetts, have attempted to pass bills explicitly prohibiting workplace discrimination on the basis of weight and height, but those efforts have largely stalled.\n\n\u201cAny updating of any anti-discrimination laws in this climate faces an uphill battle,\u201d said Gillian Thomas, a staff attorney with the ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project. \u201cI am, frankly, pessimistic about that kind of development, mainly because I have a pretty pessimistic assessment of how willing our culture \u2014 and by extension, our employers \u2014 is to expand our idea of what is an acceptable way for people to look.\u201d\n\nPuhl is more sanguine. She recently published results from a survey, conducted over several years, that found nearly 80 percent of Americans said they support some kind of laws prohibiting weight-related discrimination at work \u2014 a sign, she said, of growing recognition that these kinds of problems are prevalent and damaging.\n\n\u201cYou would think that, as rates of obesity have increased over time, that our society would become more accepting,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we see the stigma is very pervasive, and so we need to think of broader-scale solutions to really try and address these inequities people are facing.\u201d\n\nPart of the challenge, of course, is demonstrating that discrimination has occurred when it is not explicit. Bramblette\u2019s case, for example, could be hard to prove, since no one said anything about her weight. People uninitiated in the coded language of weight discrimination might say she was being overly sensitive, perhaps even paranoid. This, of course, is an issue across types of discrimination. Very often, only people who experience its daily slights and indignities can truly sense the significance of the issue.\n\nStories of people who had wildly different career trajectories before and after weight loss, however, provide powerful corroboration that such bias exists.\n\nDr. Scott Butsch, the director of obesity medicine at the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s bariatric and metabolic institute, has worked with patients across all careers \u2014 doctors, lawyers, teachers, even opera singers \u2014 who have shared their experiences with weight discrimination at work. Most revealing to him are stories from people who, after losing weight from bariatric surgery, suddenly find that their careers blossom.\n\n\u201cFor example, a lawyer who never had the opportunity to be in her firm\u2019s promotional materials,\u201d Butsch said. \u201cAll of a sudden, after losing weight, it was \u2018Oh, why don\u2019t we get you in the picture to be a part of this advertising campaign?\u2019 ... In the end, she quit the firm, even after 23 years with the company, because it was so blatantly obvious.\u201d\n\nBramblette reached out to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but said she was told her case was too subjective to warrant any action against her employer. Then she consulted with a private attorney, who said that because she found a job just two months after she left her previous position, it would be difficult for her to demonstrate she was a good candidate for any kind of damages. She was also warned that a case could follow her, making her unappealing to future employers.\n\nShe described that as one of the saddest parts of her ordeal: She was worried that if she spoke up, she would be labeled a problem and face even greater career consequences.\n\nSo instead she moved on and tells her story, hoping for some kind of legal or culture shift \u2014 knowing full well she will continue to be penalized for being overweight, despite feeling she is, in all ways, eminently qualified for the jobs she has held."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

Dr. He claimed in a video that Crispr did not affect other genes in the twins and that the babies were \u201cborn normally and healthy,\u201d but there is no way to know if that is true.\n\nIn fact, some of the data Dr. He presented at a conference in Hong Kong, after he announced the birth of the twins, is concerning, several scientists said. For one thing, indicates that he was able to disable both copies of the CCR\u2085 gene in only one of the twins, whom Dr. He identified as \u201cNana.\u201d In the other twin, \u201cLulu,\u201d only one copy of CCR\u2085 was disabled, providing limited, if any, protection against H.I.V., but Dr. He implanted the embryo anyway. He said he informed the parents and they wanted both embryos implanted.\n\nSome scientists said the data Dr. He presented also suggested several potential issues resulting from the editing process.\n\nMost importantly, said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania who reviewed the data, \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence of mosaicism\u201d in the edited embryos of both twins. \u201cI was so furious,\u201d Dr. Musunuru said. \u201cThis would have been disturbing anyway \u2014 gene-edited babies. It made it a hundred times worse knowing that he had totally mosaic embryos. It\u2019s as if you took the embryos and dipped them in acid and said \u2018You know what, I\u2019m just going to go ahead with the implantation anyway.\u2019 It\u2019s not that much different.\u201d\n\nWhile it is unclear if the babies themselves ended up with a mosaic patchwork of cells, Dr. Musunuru said the data shows that Lulu\u2019s placenta was mosaic, which is not a good sign.\n\nFinally, it is not known if his study subjects knew what they were agreeing to. The consent they signed was for an AIDS vaccine development project, and it did not mention all the risks of disabling CCR\u2085. It said that if Crispr altered other genes, \u201cthe project team is not responsible for the risk.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "From a Deceased Woman\u2019s Transplanted Uterus, a Live Birth", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/health/uterus-transplant-birth.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "A woman who received a uterus transplanted from a deceased donor has given birth to a healthy child, researchers in Brazil said on Tuesday.

If they are blocked or too narrow, the fetus may not get enough oxygen and nutrients, and the mother\u2019s blood pressure may spike toward pre-eclampsia. This can begin as early as the first trimester, but few tools are available to diagnose it at that stage.\n\n\u201cThe tests that are available today are all designed for the third trimester, and that\u2019s way too late,\u201d said Dr. Alfred Z. Abuhamad, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Va.\n\nIn 2014, the child-health division of the National Institutes of Health set out to find noninvasive methods to identify complications earlier. An infusion of $80 million into placenta research prompted Dr. Abuhamad and others to adapt technologies used in other fields, and has already provided valuable insights into early pregnancy.\n\nSome scientists are betting on magnetic resonance imaging scans, or M.R.I.s, as the most sensitive detectors of placental problems. They are using a method that measures oxygen levels in the blood; it is quick and, so far, seems to catch problems as early as the second trimester. Several teams worldwide are evaluating the technique, each in hundreds of women.\n\nBut M.R.I. is not widely in use in obstetricians\u2019 offices, Dr. Abuhamad said, in contrast with ultrasound machines, which would be a more practical option. Traditional ultrasounds can show the structure and location of the placenta, not how well the organ is functioning. But advances over the past five years have sharpened the machine\u2019s focus. One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue.\n\nDr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.\n\nOther teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems. And one group of researchers is developing an oximeter, a device that quantifies the light reflected back through layers of fat as a measure of blood oxygen."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Personal Health: The Secret to Good Health May Be a Walk in the Park", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/well/move/the-secret-to-good-health-may-be-a-walk-in-the-park.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 19:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "Even though I was heading to a highly coveted job at The New York Times in 1965, I was heartbroken to leave Minneapolis, where I had begun my journalistic career two years earlier.\n\nMinneapolis was then, and still is, a slice of heaven for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors. According to an ambitious project of the Trust for Public Land, Minneapolis leads the nation\u2019s metropolitan areas in providing the best overall access for the most people to well-equipped and serviced public parks and recreation. Its neighbor, St. Paul, is a close second.\n\nNot surprising, then, is the fact that Minneapolis-St. Paul is also ranked the healthiest urban region in the country. And no, their residents are not preserved by the cold! If anything, they are out there enjoying it \u2014 ice skating, cross-country skiing, sledding, cycling, running, walking, you name it.\n\nAn analysis by the trust revealed that 96 percent of Minneapolitans and 98 percent of St. Paulites live within a 10-minute walk of a park, compared with 70 percent of residents in the 100 largest cities over all. New York City, with 99 percent of residents enjoying easy access to a park, playground, trail or other open area, ranks ninth overall in terms of public outdoor access when park size and other factors are considered."}]
