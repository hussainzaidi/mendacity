He was the head -- and most prominent face -- of his hit reality TV shows: \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\" In both of those roles, what he said went -- without debate.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nThe whole aura of Trump is based on the idea that he does what he wants, when he wants. If he wants you fired, you get fired.\n\nAll of which brings me to the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and the possibility of collusion between the Russians and members of the Trump campaign. And Trump's clear frustration -- and nervousness(?) -- about it.\n\nAsked about the investigation on Friday, Trump said from the Oval Office: \"I'm not agitated. It's a hoax. The whole thing is a hoax. There was no collusion.\"\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts.

These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nIt's not clear how Trump obtained information about the \"inner workings\" of the Mueller investigation given that special counsel's office has been tight-lipped about its approach -- only occasionally revealing something when a plea agreement is reached or when someone like Paul Manafort faces trial based on what Mueller's team uncovered. Given Trump's track record with the truth -- and his fixation on the idea that Mueller is conducting a witch hunt (even though he's not) -- the possibility certainly exists that Trump made up his alleged insider information about the Mueller probe.\n\nThe broader context here speaks to Trump's ever-mounting frustration with his inability to control the Mueller probe. We know -- thanks to CNN reporting -- that Trump spent several hours this week huddled with his attorneys going over written answers to questions that the Mueller team had submitted to the White House regarding the 2016 campaign.\n\nThat Trump's tweet on Mueller came after that intense period of question-answering provides our clearest evidence yet that Trump's anger and impatience is bubbling over. But it's far from the only sign.\n\nThe biggest indicator of Trump desperately trying to seize control of the uncontrollable came last Wednesday when Trump finally fired his long-maligned Attorney General Jeff Sessions . Trump had never forgiven Sessions for recusing himself from the FBI investigation into Russian interference; in Trump's mind, that decision by Sessions led to the formation of the special counsel and all of the problems Mueller's investigation has caused within Trump's administration. The firing of Sessions, however, was not the big news -- that was Trump's decision to bypass Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was overseeing the Mueller investigation, and instead name Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nSuddenly, a public critic of the Mueller probe almost since its inception was in charge of its operations. (That Whitaker, who has not been confirmed by the Senate, is now in charge of people like Rosenstein, who does have Senate confirmation, is a also a potential legal hurdle .) And not only that, but Whitaker was selected over Rosenstein, who had been publicly supportive of Mueller and the probe generally.\n\nTrump himself has also grown more and more boastful about what he could do to Mueller and the probe -- if he so chose. \"I could fire everybody right now, but I don't want to stop it because politically I don't like stopping it,\" Trump said last week in the wake of the 2018 midterm elections (more on that in a minute). \"It's a disgrace. It should never have been started, because there is no crime.\"\n\nThat's not technically accurate. The only person who could fire Mueller is the attorney general. So Trump could tell Whitaker to fire Mueller and, in theory, Whitaker could do that. (Whitaker has given no public indication whether he would be willing to follow that order from Trump.) There are legal and political issues that would naturally flow from such a move -- among them the question of whether Mueller can be fired without obvious cause and how Republicans (and Democrats) in Congress would react to the special counsel's investigation being ended.\n\nTrump knows all of this. Which is what leads to his frustration. He's boxed in. He can't do what he wants to do. (Remember that Trump already tried to remove Mueller but was thwarted when then-White House counsel Donald McGahn refused to carry out the order.) He has no operational control over this situation.\n\nWhen asked Friday about his latest tweets about Mueller, Trump said tellingly: \"I like to take everything personally, because you do better that way.\"\n\nTrump, when cornered, is at his most dangerous -- to his political opponents and, candidly, to himself. He lashes out. He veers even further from established truth and facts.\n\nIn short: The longer the Mueller probe continues, the more likely Trump is to say or do something with potentially cataclysmic impact on his administration (and the investigation). All outward signs indicate he's getting closer and closer to that sort of point of no return."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: Tirade suggests Trump has an idea of what's coming", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/tj6seUiWRT4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is acting like he knows something about the Russia investigation that the rest of America has yet to learn.\n\nHis Twitter explosion on Thursday targeting special counsel Robert Mueller -- his \"thugs\" and his \"witch hunt\" investigation -- came without an apparent immediate cause.\n\nBut Trump's temper apparently boiled over after meetings on three successive days between the President and his lawyers as they work out written answers for Mueller about alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"There are some that create more issues for us legally than others,\" Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani told the paper. Some questions were \"unnecessary\" and others were \"possible traps\" or might be irrelevant, he said.\n\nGiuliani's striking complaint about a perjury trap appears to raise the question of why he might be worried about such an issue -- if the President were simply to tell the truth, in answers that will be scrubbed by his legal advisers.\n\nThe questions resulted from a tortuous negotiation between Trump's lawyers and the White House over the President's testimony. They only relate to the collusion part of the investigation and do not concern allegations that the President obstructed justice in the firing of former FBI Chief James Comey.\n\nTrump's huddles with his lawyers coincided with intense activity around the Mueller investigation, which largely went quiet in the days leading up to the midterm elections earlier this month.\n\nThe comings and goings have left Washington on tenterhooks amid mounting speculation that significant action by the special counsel could be imminent.\n\nIn the past, the President's tirades about Mueller have sometimes coincided with developments in the special counsel probe.\n\nThere are expectations that Mueller, who has not unveiled any indictments since July, could be preparing more. CNN has reported that he has also started writing a final report on his investigation.\n\nAll the while, speculation has heated up about the prospect of major staff shakeups in the West Wing, including the departure of high-level officials who previously have worked to constrain Trump's worst impulses.\n\n\"In this administration, there are arsonists and there are firefighters. The President is looking to get rid of the firefighters. The more he does, the faster his administration is going to burn down,\" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nNew questions\n\nThe President's fury sparked questions over whether he has any advance knowledge of any indictments Mueller may be preparing, or has gleaned other insight about the case from his new acting-Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nMuch of Mueller's work is taking place behind closed doors, but the evident bustle suggests plenty of reasons for Trump's dark mood.\n\nThose events included a visit by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is facing jail time on tax and fraud charges, to the special counsel's office on Monday.\n\nAttorneys for Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort, who is cooperating with Mueller after his own conviction, were seen at Mueller's office this week.\n\nJerome Corsi, an associate of former Trump political adviser Roger Stone said on Monday he expects to be indicted for giving false information to Mueller or the grand jury. Corsi later suggested in an interview with Reuters that he's in plea talks with Mueller's team.\n\nStone, who also appears to be in Mueller's sights, released text messages with an alleged WikiLeaks back channel about \"big news\" about Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before the site released hacked emails.\n\nTrump's son, Donald Trump Jr., has reportedly told friends that he could he could be indicted, possibly over a meeting he and other Trump campaign officials held with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nWith all that in mind, Trump's Thursday morning tweetstorm appears to reveal a President fuming with resentment about the probe and possibly deeply concerned about what it might reveal.\n\nMueller's questions likely offered Trump his most explicit sense yet as to where the investigation may be going and could perhaps offer him some hints about what witnesses have told Mueller. And the task of answering the questions, under the risk of perjury, may be a deeply unpleasant experience for him.\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want,\" the President said, in a comment that could be interpreted as evidence that he has inside knowledge of the investigation.\n\n\"These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\" Trump wrote in one of his most furious attacks on Mueller.\n\nMueller was actually appointed to head the FBI in 2001 by President George W. Bush, and stayed for the rest of his administration and three years into President Barack Obama's term. Obama later extended his 10-year term for another two years.\n\n'A bad week'\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley defended Mueller and his team, adding \"if they are going to do something, I suspect it will be rather soon.\"\n\n\"Obviously, the President had a bad week and he doesn't like these questions, so he is lashing out because he is afraid to take responsibility, frankly for anything,\" Quigley said.\n\nThe President also revealed his anger about the Russia probe in an interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday, which to some observers seemed like an tacit admission that he had appointed Whitaker after firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions in order to rein in the special counsel.\n\n\"Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He's -- and he's, very importantly, he's respected within DOJ,\" Trump told the conservative website.\n\n\"You know, look, as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had,\" he said. \"It's something that should have never been brought. It's an illegal investigation.\"\n\nDemocrats have warned that Whitaker, who is on record with fierce criticisms of the Mueller probe, and now oversees it, is nothing but a political henchman inserted into the top Justice Department job to rein in Mueller.\n\nHis appointment has added fresh urgency to an effort on Capitol Hill to protect Mueller. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake warned he would not vote to advance judicial nominees unless a bill shielding the special counsel got a floor vote.\n\nSenate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on Wednesday on the measure, which would allow any decision by Trump to fire the special counsel to be challenged in court."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump: I wrote answers to Mueller's questions", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/073hu6q0K8c/president-donald-trump-i-wrote-my-own-answers-to-muellers-questions-sot-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump tells the media that he wrote his own answers to questions posed by special counsel Robert Mueller, but hasn't submitted them yet."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump says he's answered questions, isn't 'agitated' by probe", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/X1nNYtVYH08/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday he was personally crafting the answers to special counsel Robert Mueller and denied he was agitated by the state of the probe.\n\n\"I write the answers.

The words \"Witch Hunt\" appeared only once in his Twitter feed in the month of October, as Trump instead focused on the midterm elections.\n\nThat ended Thursday morning, when the President sent a series of tweets lashing out against special counsel Robert Mueller and the Russia probe. The tweets came as Trump has spent much of the past week meeting with his lawyers, as CNN has reported , reviewing written questions about Russian collusion that were submitted by Mueller and his team.\n\nOn Thursday, the President resurrected several of his favorite lines of attack that, while potent with his political base, aren't grounded in evidence or facts.

It's not clear how Trump would hear about the \"inner workings\" of the investigation. After this tweet, some of Trump's critics speculated that he might have learned new details from acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is now overseeing the investigation. If true, that would raise concerns that Trump was possibly trying to interfere with the probe.\n\nFact-check of \"found no collusion\"\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, so it is premature for the President to declare that Mueller \"found no collusion.\" The special counsel hasn't said anything public about whether there was or wasn't collusion. Mueller will detail his final conclusions in a report that is expected to drop sometime in the coming months.\n\n....care how many lives the ruin.

A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nFact-check of \"highly conflicted\"\n\nThe Justice Department determined in May 2017 that there were no ethics conflicts with Mueller's appointment as special counsel. They looked into the issue because Mueller's former law firm, WilmerHale, represented some key players in the investigation.\n\nFact-check of \"worked for Obama for 8 years\"\n\nThis is incorrect. President George W. Bush tapped Mueller for FBI director in 2001. When Mueller's 10-year term was about to expire in 2011, then-President Barack Obama asked him to stay on for an additional two years. The Senate unanimously approved that extension. So, Mueller spent less than five years under Obama.\n\nUniversities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page & her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nFact-check of \"NOT Senate approved\"\n\nThis is misleading. Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and, like many other DOJ appointees, he did not require Senate confirmation for the position. Some of Mueller's critics have mounted legal challenges to his appointment, making the claim that he needed Senate approval. But so far, federal judges have rejected this argument.\n\nFact-check of \"gang of Democrat thugs\"\n\nSetting aside the vitriolic language of \"gangs\" and \"thugs\" for a moment, it's true that several lawyers who worked for Mueller donated to Democratic candidates or were registered Democrats. But importantly, about half of the team never donated to anyone. Mueller himself is a registered Republican -- and so is Rosenstein, who picked him.\n\nThe only \"Collusion\" is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others. Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don't have it. Check out how biased Facebook, Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That's the real Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nFact-check of \"take the Server\"\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers last year that the FBI asked the Democratic National Committee to hand over its servers during the federal investigation into Russian hacking. Instead, the DNC hired a private cybersecurity firm to examine their servers and provided that information to the FBI. Comey said this arrangement was not preferred, but his team determined it was \"an appropriate substitute.\"\n\nFact-check of \"in favor of the Democrats\"\n\nIn fact, the DOJ alleged in an indictment that Russian trolls used these social media sites to spread propaganda that was designed to undermine American democracy and, in some cases, support Trump's candidacy during the 2016 campaign."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "North Korea tests 'high-tech' weapon", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/ANA1mWMfBe4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Seoul (CNN) North Korea has tested a \"newly developed ultramodern\" weapon in an event supervised by leader Kim Jong Un, state media said Friday, amid faltering nuclear disarmament negotiations with the United States.\n\nVery little is known about the weapon or whether it is even new, but the test is the latest sign that Pyongyang is prepared to return to a more militaristic relationship with Washington if talks continue to go poorly.\n\n\"He's tiptoeing towards a more aggressive posture in negotiations with the US and he's signaling that he's not going to give way and can simply return to his old practices if (the US) don't change their approach,\" Josh Pollack, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterrey, told CNN.\n\nIn this undated photo released on Friday by the North Korean government, Kim Jong Un, listens to a military official as he inspects a weapon testing.\n\nNorth Korea's state news agency KCNA announced the test on Friday morning, providing no details on the location of the event and little information about the weapon itself other than it was \"tactical\" and had been commissioned \"personally\" by Kim's father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il.\n\nA South Korean government source with military knowledge told CNN the weapon was likely a piece of long-range artillery \"likely to be a multiple rocket launcher.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Snowstorm slams eastern US: 8 dead, power knocked out", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/X4mewmRkOOc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A strong wintry storm still was dumping snow Friday in far northern New England after creating traffic havoc that claimed at least eight lives across the country's eastern half and knocked out power for tens of thousands of people.\n\nA mix of rain, snow and ice that initially hit the Midwest caused headaches from the South to the Northeast, leaving up to a foot of snow in some parts of the latter and widespread freezing rain and ice accumulations elsewhere.

A date for the elections is expected to be decided on Sunday following a meeting of the coalition party heads.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Aryeh Deri also called for early elections.\n\nBennett's withdrawal from the coalition would leave Netanyahu without the minimum 61 seats needed to govern, making elections inevitable and ending a government that lasted nearly four years.\n\nA spokesman for Netanyahu's Likud party said in a statement after the meeting with Bennett that the Prime Minister would try to stabilize his government on Sunday at the weekly cabinet meeting.\n\n\"At the beginning of the week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold conversations with the heads of the coalitions, and he relies on the ministers' responsibility not to make a historic mistake in toppling a right-wing government,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that it's important to make every effort in order to preserve the right-wing government and not to repeat the historical mistake of 1992 when a right-wing government was toppled, raised the left to power and brought the Oslo disaster upon Israel.\"\n\nA statement released a short time later said Netanyahu had begun those conversations Friday afternoon.\n\nNetanyahu's troubles began Wednesday when Liberman, his hardline Defense Minister, announced his resignation. Liberman had openly opposed a ceasefire reached with Gaza one day earlier that ended the worst 24 hours of fighting since the 2014 war, advocating instead for a harsher blow against Hamas, the militant group that controls the coastal enclave. Liberman called the ceasefire \"a capitulation to terror.\"\n\nFrom Monday night to Tuesday afternoon, Gaza militants fired some 400 rockets into Israel, while the Israeli military struck more than 100 targets inside Gaza.\n\nLiberman didn't have enough seats to topple the government on his own, but his withdrawal left Netanyahu with a bare minimum 61-seat coalition, allowing other parties to make demands of the Israeli leader.\n\nThe sudden vacancy allowed Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, to demand the defense portfolio, promising to quit the government if he didn't get it.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Kahlon, the Finance Minister, met with Netanyahu and said it was time to call early elections.\n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, Kahlon said, \"The stability required at this time is not achievable in the present situation, and therefore the responsible act is the establishment of a new, strong and stable government.\"\n\nDeri, the Interior Minister, echoed his call, increasing pressure on Netanyahu to dissolve the government.\n\nThe political turbulence comes as Netanyahu faces criminal investigations that have hit him and his inner circle. Israeli police say they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in two separate investigations. He was questioned as a suspect in a third investigation. Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, often employing the phrase \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\"\n\nThe criminal investigations have barely damaged the Prime Minister's standing in the polls or his popularity. Polls have repeatedly projected that Netanyahu's Likud party would increase its number of seats if early elections are held.\n\nBut the crisis may pose a new challenge for the Israeli leader, since it appears he is being led to call early elections, instead of calling them on his own.\n\nBy law, the government must choose an election date within three to five months, making March or May the most likely time for elections.

A hatchback version of the car was unveiled last April at the New York Auto Show and is on sale now, but the sedan is the car most people recognize as \"the Corolla.\"\n\nThe generally unexciting, unassuming Corolla long ago passed such cultural icons as Ford's Model T and Volkswagen's Beetle on its way to becoming the best-selling car model ever. More than 45 million have been sold globally since the Corolla was introduced in 1966, helping to usher in a period of rapid growth for the Japanese auto industry.\n\nIts popularity helped make Toyota the global force it is today. So, while the unveiling of a new multimillion dollar supercar may seem more exciting, the introduction of a new Corolla is unquestionably more important for both the auto industry and for far more people who actually buy cars.\n\nThe Toyota Corolla XSE, shown here, is the top-of-the-line version offering the most features and the most performance.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, the most important thing about this new car is that, once it goes on sale around the globe, the Corolla will be essentially the same car everywhere. In recent years, cars called the Corolla that were sold in different parts of the world have not always been closely related. In the United States alone, Toyota dealers sold the Corolla and the Corolla iM, two completely different small cars with the same name.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Death toll grows to 63 in California's Camp Fire", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/yjGOTFflVK8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The number of missing in Californian wildfires has soared to 631, as authorities added hundreds of names to the lists of the unaccounted for Thursday, in what has become the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history.\n\nButte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said Thursday evening the death toll from the Camp Fire in northern California had grown to 63 people.

Officials have said it's hard to determine the number of missing, because some people may have evacuated and can't be reached with cell phone service unreliable due to the fire.\n\n\"There are a lot of people displaced and we're finding a lot of people don't know we are looking for them,\" Honea said.\n\nThe fire turned the hard-hit town of Paradise into ash and debris and also devastated the nearby communities of Magalia and Concow. Honea said three sets of remains were found Thursday in Paradise, three in Magalia and one in Concow.\n\nHonea has invited relatives of the missing to visit the sheriff's office in Oroville so authorities can collect DNA samples from them. The DNA will be used to help identify fire victims, Honea said.\n\n\"This is a daunting task. We feel really bad for the people who don't know what happened to their loved ones and our hearts go out to them,\" Butte County Sheriff's Investigations Sgt. Steve Collins said. \"We want to give them some answers.\"\n\nTroops, cadaver dogs and coroners involved\n\nThe somber search for the missing in Butte County is painstaking.\n\nIt involves 461 people and 22 cadaver dogs in Paradise, Magalia and Concow, authorities said.\n\nDozens of National Guard troops have joined the search effort, Collins said. Once they find the remains, with the help of forensic experts, the coroners are sent to recover them.\n\nTo enable searchers access to the destroyed structures, crews help move collapsed buildings and roofs out of the way.\n\nThe white overalls protect the rescue workers from ash and debris and help avoid contamination, Collins said.\n\n\"They are going to be searching vehicles that have been burned. They'll be searching residences that have been burned. Checking around the residences ... our mission is to find the victims from this fire, recover them and get them identified and notify the families to give them some answers.\"\n\nRoger Kelton, 67, wipes his tears while searching through the remains of his mother-in-law's home.\n\nThe search area is wide and spread out.\n\n\"It's not just the area; it's the number of homes, the number of trailers, the multistory buildings. All of that changes the complexity of this operation,\" Collins said.\n\nExperts are conducting targeted searches by first sending deputies to areas in which people have been reported missing. The number changes daily with more calls coming in.\n\n\"We're trying to follow up with those people who are calling in to find out if they've made any contact with their loved ones,\" Collins said. \"We're asking people to call us if they do come in contact with their loved one so that we don't spend time looking for somebody that's already found.\"\n\nHousing shortage\n\nFamilies who lost their homes in the fires are going to have a very hard time finding a place to live, Butte County Housing Authority Executive Director Ed Mayer said.\n\n\"We just had 10% of our county's housing stock erased in one day; it's hard to convey the significance of that,\" he said.\n\nA Walmart in Chico has a parking lot full of vehicles, including motor homes, in which people are living, often running the heat in their cars and trucks all night. Other people are staying in tents.\n\n\"It's been a week and people have been great, but I don't know how long it's going to last,\" Mayer said. \"Short-term, we are fine, but long-term we are not.\"\n\nOne of the selling points of Paradise was its affordable housing, but that's been erased, Mayer said.\n\n\"And there is nothing to replace it\" for low-income families, he said.\n\nSuspected outbreak of norovirus reported\n\nMore than 9,600 firefighters, including many from out of state, are battling wildfires across California.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which has destroyed about 9,700 homes and scorched 141,000 acres in Northern California, is one of several in the state. By Thursday, it was 40% contained.\n\nAdding to the misery for evacuees, officials reported a suspected outbreak of norovirus at a shelter in Chico. Evacuees showed some symptoms, but officials are waiting for test results for confirmation. The stomach bug causes vomiting, nausea and diarrhea.\n\nOther fires in the state\n\nIn Southern California, the Woolsey Fire -- which, like the Camp Fire, began November 8 -- has killed at least two people in Malibu. Authorities are trying to determine whether a third person found in a burned home in Agoura Hills died as a result of that fire, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire has burned more than 98,000 acres and destroyed more than 500 structures . It is 62% contained. More favorable weather conditions for firefighters are in the forecast.\n\nMore than 230,000 acres burned in California in the past week. That's larger than the cities of Chicago and Boston combined. And in 30 days, firefighters have battled more than 500 blazes, said Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to give the correct number of missing people in the Camp Fire."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Many Camp Fire victims didn't get emergency alerts.

Please help us to be safe,\" she pleaded in the video.\n\nThough she managed to escape, she never did receive an emergency alert to her phone telling her to watch out for the oncoming fire.\n\nBrad Weldon, also from Paradise, did get a phone alert. But he said it came as he was already fighting off the flames surrounding his home.\n\nTheir experiences reflect a widespread issue for residents in Paradise and surrounding Butte County: Many people did not receive emergency alert warnings, and some who did received them too late.\n\nInstead, they learned of the danger not from authorities but through their own eyes and ears, or from concerned friends and family.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea defended the county's use of the emergency alert system during the fire. He said the situation was \"extraordinarily chaotic and rapidly moving\" and so it took time for fire experts to get to the scene, determine the fire's direction and warn the affected people -- time they just didn't have.\n\n\"There were notifications sent out, but as I said over and over again, this fire was moving so rapidly we couldn't keep ahead of it,\" Honea said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said landline phones are automatically enrolled in the county's alert system, but cell phones have to be opted in to get the alerts. She said they have conducted drives to get people to register, but she wasn't sure how many residents signed up.\n\n\"I got a phone call, I got texts on my cell phone. My husband got a phone call on the landline,\" she told CNN. \"So that's the kind of notification people would get. If they went outside they could see what was happening also.\"\n\nThe fire spread too quickly\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California A burned neighborhood is seen in Paradise, California, on Thursday, November 15.

Hide Caption 93 of 93\n\nThe questions over the use of the emergency alert system come as firefighters continue to battle the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nThe fire's rapid spread through the town of Paradise and beyond left at least 56 people dead and destroyed thousands of homes and structures, making it the most destructive and deadliest blaze in state history.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Butte County sheriff published a list of more than a hundred people unaccounted for and still missing from the Camp Fire. The blaze, which has burned 140,000 acres, remains just 40% contained.\n\nHonea said that, for now, Butte County would continue to focus on assisting CalFire on fighting the Camp Fire. Once the fire is contained, they will go back and look closer into the emergency alert system, he said.\n\n\"We're getting a lot of requests and calls from people who want us to spend a lot of time going back and collecting data and there will be a time for that, but right now I need to focus on the fight in front of us,\" Honea said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape 02:15\n\nAs Honea noted, the speed of the fire took everyone by surprise and left residents of Paradise scrambling to escape in car and on foot.\n\nThe Camp Fire charred 20,000 acres last Thursday in less than 14 hours . Its most significant growth period was early Thursday afternoon, when it grew 10,000 acres in about 90 minutes -- burning the equivalent of more than one football field every second during that time.\n\n\"We did our absolute best in terms of Amber-style alert, we used emergency mass notification system as well as our efforts to notify people when we're in the communities. We employed that,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea offered several other explanations for why the alerts did not reach people in harm's way.\n\nHe said the fire took place in a remote area where cell phone service may not be great. He also said that some people who received the warning may not have acted immediately to get out, and suggested that people may have been lulled into a false sense of security regarding fires.\n\n\"I don't think it would be appropriate to draw the conclusion that because (bodies) were found in their house, you can automatically assume they were not notified,\" he said. \"It is possible that they were notified but they chose not to heed the warning and we have heard of stories like that.\"\n\n'For the most part, our plan worked'\n\nMayor Jones said that the fire simply moved too quickly, especially compared to 2008's devastating fire season.\n\n\"I mean, it just happened so fast. There wasn't time to give anybody longer. In 2008, we had three hours between the first notice and the mandatory evacuation. We had three hours to pack up stuff,\" she said.\n\nThis time, though? \"We had no time at all. Maybe five minutes,\" she added.\n\nAbout 26,000 people live in Paradise, some 85 miles north of Sacramento. Jones estimated that about 80 to 90% of the town was destroyed.\n\nStill, despite the issue with the alert system, she defended the evacuation plan, calling it \"organized chaos.\"\n\n\"It did take time to get everybody through just because so many people were evacuated at the same time,\" she said. \"But I think for the most part, our plan worked. If we hadn't had that plan, it would have been awful.\"\n\nLast October, officials in Northern California faced similar criticism from residents who said they learned of the fire by the smell of smoke or noise from their pets rather than from an emergency alert.\n\nAt the time, Kelly Huston, then the deputy director for California's Office of Emergency Service, said alerts and warnings happen on a local level, not a state level.\n\n\"They decide what are the appropriate alerts for their population,\" Houston said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Search for remains continues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/GAeFXCEZ9pU/california-camp-fire-search-for-remains-victims-dan-simon-pkg-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "As the death toll rises in communities ravaged by the Camp Fire, rescue workers are in Paradise, California, searching for human remains and any victims who are still unaccounted for after the blaze.

But if its equipment is found to be responsible for it, PG&E \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" and that this could have \"a material impact\" on its financial results.\n\nThe utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, the company said in the SEC filing\n\nBut the fire is far from being under control, which means more damage is likely. PG&E said in the filing that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimates the fire won't be fully contained until November 30.\n\nThe damages alone could cost up to $6.8 billion. according to a report from Moody's this week.\n\nPG&E may not have enough to cover the cost that, let alone any legal fees or fines it might have to pay. The utility said in its filing that it currently has $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nShares of PG&E ( PCG ) plunged more than 30% Wednesday following this disclosure and were briefly halted for volatility. The stock has now fallen by half since the Camp Fire began.\n\nPower lines rest on cars that were burned by the Camp Fire on November 10, 2018 in Paradise, California.\n\nThe utility could need another bailout from the state of California if it's found to be liable for the Camp Fire.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown signed a bill in September that lets PG&E issue bonds backed by surcharges from the utility's customers. Those bonds would help pay for damages tied to deadly California wildfires in October 2017 caused by faulty PG&E equipment.\n\nThe bill allows for the possibility that utilities could issue similar bonds for future fires, but that is not guaranteed.\n\nPG&E already faces one lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Camp Fire.\n\nA group of law firms that has dubbed itself the Northern California Fire Lawyers filed a suit Tuesday on behalf of Camp Fire survivors.\n\nThe firms allege in the suit that \"PG&E was negligent in failing to maintain its infrastructure and properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines.\"\n\nA spokesperson for PG&E told CNN Business that \"it's important to remember that the cause has yet to be determined.\"\n\n\"We are aware of lawsuits regarding the Camp Fire. Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers,\" the spokesperson added."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Cell phone videos show drivers fleeing fire", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/h0ElPZeBMpE/california-wildfires-orig-acl.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Some questions were \"unnecessary\" and others were \"possible traps\" or might be irrelevant, he said.\n\nGiuliani's striking complaint about a perjury trap appears to raise the question of why he might be worried about such an issue -- if the President were simply to tell the truth, in answers that will be scrubbed by his legal advisers.\n\nThe questions resulted from a tortuous negotiation between Trump's lawyers and the White House over the President's testimony. They only relate to the collusion part of the investigation and do not concern allegations that the President obstructed justice in the firing of former FBI Chief James Comey.\n\nTrump's huddles with his lawyers coincided with intense activity around the Mueller investigation, which largely went quiet in the days leading up to the midterm elections earlier this month.\n\nThe comings and goings have left Washington on tenterhooks amid mounting speculation that significant action by the special counsel could be imminent.\n\nIn the past, the President's tirades about Mueller have sometimes coincided with developments in the special counsel probe.\n\nThere are expectations that Mueller, who has not unveiled any indictments since July, could be preparing more. CNN has reported that he has also started writing a final report on his investigation.\n\nAll the while, speculation has heated up about the prospect of major staff shakeups in the West Wing, including the departure of high-level officials who previously have worked to constrain Trump's worst impulses.\n\n\"In this administration, there are arsonists and there are firefighters. The President is looking to get rid of the firefighters. The more he does, the faster his administration is going to burn down,\" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nNew questions\n\nThe President's fury sparked questions over whether he has any advance knowledge of any indictments Mueller may be preparing, or has gleaned other insight about the case from his new acting-Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nMuch of Mueller's work is taking place behind closed doors, but the evident bustle suggests plenty of reasons for Trump's dark mood.\n\nThose events included a visit by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is facing jail time on tax and fraud charges, to the special counsel's office on Monday.\n\nAttorneys for Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort, who is cooperating with Mueller after his own conviction, were seen at Mueller's office this week.\n\nJerome Corsi, an associate of former Trump political adviser Roger Stone said on Monday he expects to be indicted for giving false information to Mueller or the grand jury. Corsi later suggested in an interview with Reuters that he's in plea talks with Mueller's team.\n\nStone, who also appears to be in Mueller's sights, released text messages with an alleged WikiLeaks back channel about \"big news\" about Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before the site released hacked emails.\n\nTrump's son, Donald Trump Jr., has reportedly told friends that he could he could be indicted, possibly over a meeting he and other Trump campaign officials held with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nWith all that in mind, Trump's Thursday morning tweetstorm appears to reveal a President fuming with resentment about the probe and possibly deeply concerned about what it might reveal.\n\nMueller's questions likely offered Trump his most explicit sense yet as to where the investigation may be going and could perhaps offer him some hints about what witnesses have told Mueller. And the task of answering the questions, under the risk of perjury, may be a deeply unpleasant experience for him.\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want,\" the President said, in a comment that could be interpreted as evidence that he has inside knowledge of the investigation.\n\n\"These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\" Trump wrote in one of his most furious attacks on Mueller.\n\nMueller was actually appointed to head the FBI in 2001 by President George W. Bush, and stayed for the rest of his administration and three years into President Barack Obama's term. Obama later extended his 10-year term for another two years.\n\n'A bad week'\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley defended Mueller and his team, adding \"if they are going to do something, I suspect it will be rather soon.\"\n\n\"Obviously, the President had a bad week and he doesn't like these questions, so he is lashing out because he is afraid to take responsibility, frankly for anything,\" Quigley said.\n\nThe President also revealed his anger about the Russia probe in an interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday, which to some observers seemed like an tacit admission that he had appointed Whitaker after firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions in order to rein in the special counsel.\n\n\"Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He's -- and he's, very importantly, he's respected within DOJ,\" Trump told the conservative website.\n\n\"You know, look, as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had,\" he said. \"It's something that should have never been brought. It's an illegal investigation.\"\n\nDemocrats have warned that Whitaker, who is on record with fierce criticisms of the Mueller probe, and now oversees it, is nothing but a political henchman inserted into the top Justice Department job to rein in Mueller.\n\nHis appointment has added fresh urgency to an effort on Capitol Hill to protect Mueller. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake warned he would not vote to advance judicial nominees unless a bill shielding the special counsel got a floor vote.\n\nSenate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on Wednesday on the measure, which would allow any decision by Trump to fire the special counsel to be challenged in court."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "For Trump, there's no easy way out of his funk", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Kzj2CZoG1gQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) By multiple accounts, Donald Trump is in one of the deepest funks of his presidency . The bad news is that the challenges and threats that are making his mood so dark are likely to get worse before they get better.\n\nThe President is angry at his rebuke from voters in the midterm elections . The oppressive prospect of action by special counsel Robert Mueller hangs like an immovable cloud over his White House. Staff chaos in the West Wing is producing lurid palace intrigue stories in the media that the President hates\n\nAbroad, he feuds with allied world leaders, and he's been so effective in implementing his \"America First\" policy that he's the odd man out at summits.\n\nAnd things are unlikely to improve quickly. Many legal observers expect new indictments to come soon in the Mueller probe, potentially bringing the investigation closer to Trump's inner circle in its final stages. The President fulminated over the probe on Thursday morning, calling it on Twitter \"A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nDemocrats are prepping a barrage of investigations that will make life in his White House a misery -- from attempts to seize his tax returns and probe his business dealings to investigations into key policy areas like immigration.\n\n\"He's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is letting off steam where he can. He's feuding with a former friend, Emmanuel Macron, mocking the French President's approval rating (at 29%, it is lower than Trump's) and the French jobless rate of over 9%.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday, the President betrayed his disturbed equilibrium, claiming that voter fraud had cost Republicans key races\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again,\" Trump claimed, without evidence.\n\nNot the first President to feel this way\n\nTrump is not the first President to feel isolated, angry, rejected by voters or down in the dumps. Everyone who sits in the Oval Office feels that way sooner or later, though Trump's temperament is more volcanic than most.\n\nThe question for Trump is, what can he do -- other than a few restorative weekends on the golf course in Florida -- to improve his position ahead of a crucial period that will define opening chapters of his re-election campaign?\n\nOften when they are in trouble, Presidents engineer staff shakeups to bring in new ideas and energy. They go looking for wins in foreign policy, an area that pesky congressional foes can do little to disrupt.\n\nMore fundamentally, Trump could examine his entire political approach. While his strategy of division and tearing at cultural and racial divides helped him win the White House, it seemed to backfire in key House races. Failure to win back the suburbs could harm his hopes of winning a second term in 2020.\n\nIf Trump never gave another angry news conference or swore off explosive tweets, it's possible that his political situation -- and his 39% approval rating in the latest CNN poll -- would improve.\n\nAfter all he's kept many of his campaign promises. Unemployment is at its lowest point in half a century and economic growth is going gangbusters.\n\nAnd conservatives will thank Trump for decades for his two successful Supreme Court nominations.\n\nBut the President is so identified with convention-tearing tactics that it's probably impossible for him to change his style. It's probably too late as well, since he's made no effort to broaden his support base since taking office.\n\nTrump's tempestuous personality and unwillingness to be constrained also likely mean that another remedy available to other Presidents -- a hotshot new staffer to shake up operations in the West Wing -- is unlikely to work.\n\nHis first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, failed to impose order on Trump and was soon out the door. His successor, John Kelly, who is rumored to be on his way out, was soon drowned out by chaos.\n\nThe idea that Trump will look at election results, have some kind of political conversion and become a kinder, gentler President is also unthinkable.\n\nHe almost never admits he's wrong and he's been looking for people to blame for the GOP loss in the House.\n\nFor instance, the President listed GOP candidates who refused to accept his support -- or what he called \"the embrace\" -- at a post-midterm election news conference.\n\nA boost on the horizon?\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? 02:21\n\nSo what about a win on the world stage to boost the President's spirits?\n\nThere's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. US Middle East policy is in uproar since it's anchored on Saudi Arabia, which is being ostracized over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nStill, a breakthrough in a joint US and British diplomatic bid to end the war in Yemen would not just boost Trump's political prospects, it also would be a significant victory for humanity.\n\nTrump's hopes of a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have taken a dent, with Pyongyang angry at the lack of concessions by the US and new indications that it is pressing ahead with its missile program.\n\nLater this month, Trump will head to the G20 summit. Progress in defusing his trade war with China at his talks there with President Xi Jinping -- or even a ceasefire -- could be spun as a foreign policy victory.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet with Vladimir Putin at the summit in Argentina. But that's a potential political landmine, given allegations of Russian election interference that have produced unflattering media coverage of his chats with the Russian leader, which has infuriated the President.\n\nThe chances of significant wins at home also seem slim, given the gridlock that will descend on Washington when Democrats take the House gavel.\n\nBut Trump mused after the midterm elections that the new arrangements might be more conducive to deal-making than had a thin GOP majority materialized.\n\n\"This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't,\" he said.\n\nTrump seemed like someone trying to convince himself as much as the reporters in the room. But it's possible there is common ground on issues like prescription drug prices or infrastructure.\n\nThere was actually a ray of light on Wednesday when Trump had Democrats and Republicans to the White House to sign a bill that represents a small step toward criminal justice reform.\n\n\"Did I hear the word bipartisan?\" Trump quipped at the signing ceremony.\n\nOnce the Democratic subpoenas start flying, however, the room for compromise might shrivel.\n\nSo Trump will have one final option -- elevate an enemy -- a device he has effectively used throughout his political and business career.\n\nHe could choose to stage a showdown over a year-end spending bill to wring more financing for his border wall out of Congress. Though it's not clear that the possible government shutdown that could result would help him politically.\n\nThere is an argument that Trump will actually profit from lining up against a Democratic-led House next year -- especially if Nancy Pelosi, whose approval ratings are worse than his, gets her old job back as speaker.\n\nWhen 2019 dawns, a flurry of Democrats are likely to begin launching presidential campaigns, giving him an excuse to head out to the place where he always feels best: among his adoring throngs on the campaign trail."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Pence takes a global role as Trump broods", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/YHO3JQaN0MI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) One is huddling with the Russian President, gripping-and-grinning with the Japanese prime minister and pressing Myanmar's ruler to free imprisoned journalists.\n\nThe other is tweeting fury at the special counsel, sitting for lengthy sessions with his private attorneys and working to salvage his image as commander in chief after it took a bruising thanks to a canceled cemetery visit.\n\nThis week, as Vice President Mike Pence crosses Asia assuming duties traditionally carried out by the President, his boss Donald Trump remains back in Washington to brood over electoral losses and the special counsel probe.\n\nHe is skipping the yearly summits that usually bring US presidents around the globe for meetings with counterparts and high-profile speeches meant to illustrate American commitment in the region. Trump, who attended the gatherings last year but departed early, sent his No. 2 instead.\n\n\"Overall, it's just a very bad optic when we don't show up,\" said Victor Cha, senior adviser and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who was considered for an ambassadorship to South Korea in the Trump administration. \"(Pence will) be there. And there are small things that they'll be doing. But the overall message is going to be there's disinterest and it's not a priority. And that's not good, given the broader context of what's happening in Asia.\"\n\nUS officials have insisted that Trump's absence from the summits doesn't amount to a snub. Pence told a gathering on Wednesday that he'd just spoken to the President by phone and he \"asked me to convey his regards and greetings and appreciation to each of you.\"\n\nAnd US presidents have missed the gatherings in the past, though for last-minute reasons, such as a government shutdown, and not as a planned non-appearance.\n\nStill, with Trump deciding to skip this year's summits, other leaders have sought to fill the void. Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Singapore to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and East Asia Summit meetings, where he worked to strengthen economic and military ties in the region. Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea, hoping to advance Beijing's influence in the South Pacific.\n\nPence is there, too, but without the draw of being his country's No. 1.\n\nReclaim his standing\n\nTrump will have an opportunity to reclaim his global standing in two weeks, when he travels to Argentina for two days of meetings at the G20 summit, including with the presidents of China and Russia. But for now it is Pence doing the talking while Trump has largely withdrawn.\n\nThat's a marked shift from before the midterm elections, when the President was traveling constantly to promote Republican candidates at loud, hour-long rallies. He conducted a string of interviews and stopped at nearly every opportunity to speak with journalists as he was coming and going from the White House.\n\nNow, Trump is remaining mostly quiet. He scrapped a planned trip to the southern border this week, officials said. His public schedule has been relatively light, though he'll preside over a Medal of Freedom ceremony on Friday and tour fire damage in California on Saturday. The President has met the last three days with his attorneys to discuss written responses to special counsel Robert Mueller , according to a source familiar with the matter, including a meeting Wednesday night with Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHe sat for a friendly interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday , but has not engaged in a public back and forth with reporters for nearly a week. He last took questions from the press corps on Friday, ahead of his visit to Paris.\n\nEven abroad, Trump eschewed a heavy itinerary of diplomacy with the world leaders gathered in the French capital to commemorate the World War I armistice. He met only with his host, French President Emmanuel Macron, and held short informal discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nFor hours on Saturday afternoon, Trump was without any official activities after a planned visit to an American cemetery outside Paris was canceled because of rain. Instead, he remained at the US ambassador's residence getting updates on election recounts commencing back home and watching television. As they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing.\n\nTrump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nThe scrapped cemetery visit sparked virulent backlash, with some of Trump's critics suggesting he wasn't willing to brave the inclement weather to honor fallen American troops. The White House insisted that was not the case, citing logistical and security concerns that prevented the President from traveling to the site.\n\nImage of a military-minded leader\n\nAfter the controversy, Trump has worked to fortify his image as a military-minded leader. He visited Marines at their barracks in Washington on Thursday before delivering remarks at the White House laying out the steps his administration has taken to support veterans.\n\nBut if there was one person holding the mantle of US statesmanship this week, it has been Pence, who met in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before traveling to Singapore and onward to Australia and Papua New Guinea for the summit talks.\n\nHe's taken on hefty diplomatic tasks, such as confronting Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi over the treatment of her country's stateless Rohingya Muslim population. Even as back home the White House was going to court over the suspension of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's credentials, Pence pressed Suu Kyi over the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\n\"I look forward to speaking to you about the premium that we place on a free and independent press,\" Pence told Suu Kyi ahead of their talks.\n\nLater, cameras caught Pence in intense conversation with Putin, with national security adviser John Bolton between them. Bolton had traveled with Pence to Asia rather than remain behind in Washington with Trump. In his absence, Trump dismissed his deputy Mira Ricardel. Pence raised the 2016 election meddling with Putin, aides said.\n\nLater this week he travels onward to Papua New Guinea for the APEC meetings, where Xi will take center stage. Like every year, leaders will pose for a photo in a traditional shirt. But for the first time since 2013 -- when Obama canceled a planned appearance in Bali because of a government shutdown -- the US president won't be there.\n\nAt last year's APEC meeting in Vietnam, the event's organizers faced a last minute scramble to change the color of a giant onstage screen from orange to blue after American officials raised urgent concerns the the President would disappear if he stood in front of the electronic, apricot-hued screen.\n\nWith no Trump, they're breathing easier this year."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Bungled court filing cites charges against Assange", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/wCqqafq_Ni4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A garden-variety court filing has mistakenly revealed US government efforts to criminally charge Julian Assange in an embarrassing episode for federal prosecutors in their nearly decade-long battle with the WikiLeaks founder.\n\nIn a court filing unsealed last week, prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia included two explicit references to charges against Assange while asking a judge to keep a case about coercion and enticement of a minor under wraps.\n\n\"Another procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged,\" prosecutors wrote in the August 22 filing that was later unsealed on November 8, sitting undetected for days on the public docket.\n\n\"The complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter,\" prosecutors added in the filing.\n\nFederal prosecutors regularly reuse motions as templates for court filings, but the inclusion of such a high-profile name in a sealed criminal case, in this instance, amounted to a significant blunder.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The dirty little secret of the Florida recounts", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/C0Z3au80EuQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Based on the number of lawsuits, cable news coverage and overall drama coming out of Florida at the moment, you might think that the outcomes of the state's Senate and governor's races are balancing on a knife's edge -- with every judge's decision potentially making the difference between winning and losing.\n\nThe reality is, well, far from that.\n\nHere's the thing: While the races for governor and, especially, Senate are quite close, the most likely outcome -- by far -- is that the Republican candidates who are leading now will wind up winning.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nThe difficulty in seeing this forest through the trees of drama is based on this reality: The margins in both races are very small but only as compared to the raw number of votes cast. In terms of the sorts of historical margins that we've seen recounts -- automatic or manual -- flip, these margins are nowhere near small enough to expect that outcome.\n\nLet's go over the numbers first.\n\nIn the Senate race, Gov. Rick Scott (R) has 4,097,689 votes as compared to Sen. Bill Nelson's (D) 4,085,086. That's a margin for Scott of 12,603 votes. In the governor's race, former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) has 4,075,445 votes while Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has 4,041,762. That's a 33,683-vote lead for DeSantis. Scott's margin amounts to 0.15% of all the votes cast (8,183,652) while DeSantis' edge is 0.41% of the 8,118,074 ballots cast in the governor's race.\n\nWhich is a SUPER SMALL margin.\n\nBut the vote gaps in the two races -- 12,000 and 33,000 -- are massive when you consider the history of modern recounts.\n\nThe most recent hugely high-profile recount happened a decade ago in Minnesota between Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken. The state canvassing board showed Coleman with a 206-vote lead. A recount was triggered. Almost two months later -- in January 2009 -- Franken had the lead by 225 votes. After a HUGE amount of legal wrangling, Franken's final margin was finalized at 312 votes. From the beginning to the end of the process, the vote changed by 518 votes in Franken's favor. That was 0.01% of the 2,862,451 votes cast.\n\nFour years earlier, the Washington state governor's race ended in a virtual tie between Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, and Republican Dino Rossi. Rossi was originally named the winner by a margin of 261 votes. A mandated machine recount narrowed Rossi's lead to 42 votes. Gregoire, with the help of a number of national Democrats who raised money for her, funded -- via the state party -- a manual recount. The manual recount ended 58 days after the election, and gave Gregoire a 129-vote final margin over Rossi. The total votes changed by the series of manual and automatic recounts was 390 total votes, or 0.01% of all ballots cast.\n\nThe point here is that in the two most recent statewide recounts of a major race -- for governor or Senate -- the starting margin between the two candidates was less than 300 votes. That's miles and miles away from where we are in either the Senate or governor's race in Florida. And, as Harry Enten notes in his terrific piece on why Nelson is going to need a miracle to win , the 2004 Washington governor's race and the 2008 Minnesota Senate race are not anomalous when it comes to recounts. Writes Harry\n\n\"According to a FairVote database of statewide recounts from 2000 to 2015, the average recount moves the margin by 0.02 points. Nelson needs the margin to move by nearly eight times as much. ... In terms of pure votes, it doesn't look any better for Nelson. The average recount from 2000 to 2015 shifted the result by 282 votes. You don't need to be a math wizard to know that 282 is considerably less than 12,000. The maximum change in the margin in any recount from 2000 to 2015 was 1,247 votes.\"\n\nThose facts -- and the long history of recounts changing only races in which the original count was extremely narrow -- get lost in the coverage of the various suits and countersuits both sides are lobbing at each other. President Donald Trump has added to the confusion by repeatedly insisting via Twitter that there is something nefarious going on in the state's MANDATED recount.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" tweeted Trump . \"An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\"\n\nNow. History is only predictive until it's not. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for one, seems to believe that Nelson will buck history. \"When all the votes are counted in Florida, we could be just where we started at the beginning of the 115th Congress, with 48 members, even facing the worst map that we've ever had,\" the New York Democrat insisted.\n\nMaybe! But a victory by Nelson or Gillum, given the margins they are trailing by, would be hugely out of step with what most recounts -- manual or machine -- produce."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Deadly multistate salmonella outbreak related to raw turkey grows", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/jPNe2HyebRs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain.\n\nThe samples were from a Sept. 11, 2018 production, and, according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states.

These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDespite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors, Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\nHe also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or \"appealing to youth.\"\n\n\"This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters, or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda,\" the announcement said.\n\nConsumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\n\"We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" he said. \"This is one of our highest priorities.\"\n\n'Spike in use'\n\nOne in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month, according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I'm also a father of young kids, and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about,\" Gottlieb told CNN. \"Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools, in their middle schools.\"\n\nHealth experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"This is a large pool of future risk.\"\n\nThe new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year, and they are using flavored liquids more often, according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days, and over two-thirds had used flavored products.\n\n\"Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use, and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products, with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease.\"\n\nThe new numbers come from a school-based survey, conducted from March to May, which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year, now totaling 3.6 million kids, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe \"alarming\" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers \"earlier than usual\" in hopes of spurring immediate action, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes, we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily,\" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThe rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now, that number is 20.8%.\n\nGottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years.\n\n\"The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains,\" he told CNN. \"We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nHealth and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals, but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions, teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products \"sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance, a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop),\" the announcement said.\n\nCritics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence.\n\n\"The FDA needs to go further,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement Friday. \"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales.\"\n\nThe FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past, issuing warnings and fines to more than 1,300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids, after an undercover investigation this summer.\n\nMyers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA \"as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids, as in the case of Juul.\"\n\nInstead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.\n\nThis decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services, filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval.\n\nUnder Gottlieb's latest proposal, the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use.\n\n\"We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nHe told CNN, \"If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here, because there is more that we can do.\"\n\nMenthol\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Thursday. \"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes, saying that \"the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans.\"\n\nNearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010, representing more than 80% of black smokers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, R.J. Reynolds, which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US, denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it \"will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans\" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would \"increase the illegal market, fueling more criminal activity.\"\n\nThe company has fought previous similar efforts, contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, which voters approved in June.\n\nCiting the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth, National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA \"to move forward with urgency to implement this plan\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear,\" Morial said.\n\n'Not enough'\n\nVaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday.\n\n\"No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However, this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative,\" Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause,\" he said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids.\n\n\"We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product,\" said the association, which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.\n\nPharmacy chain CVS Health, which does not sell tobacco or vaping products, supported the move. Its chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan, said that the company applauds \"the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products, which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"The need for action is urgent,\" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. \"But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough.\n\n\"The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\" she added, \"and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids.\"\n\nOther actions\n\nThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids, beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.\n\nIt recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nThat move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.\n\nThis month, Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will \"focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth.\"\n\nGottlieb has met with companies like Juul, asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands. But some have been critical of these efforts, with one anti-tobacco advocate comparing them to \"asking the fox to recommend plans for guarding the hen house.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe leading maker of e-cigarettes, Juul, vowed on Tuesday to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.

As well as issues with mobility and comfort, the twins had recently been losing weight, which was a concern to doctors, Elizabeth Lodge, CEO of Melbourne-based nonprofit Children First Foundation, which funded the operation said last month.\n\nThe girls' operation was estimated to cost about $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), according to 9 News.\n\n'Delightful to look after'\n\nNurse coordinator Smith said Nima and Dawa have been a delight to look after, and that their personalities were shining through.\n\nMegan Collins, another nurse on the ward, agreed that the pair were in good spirits.\n\n\"They're loving interacting with the nursing staff,\" Collins said.\n\nThe operation was estimated to have cost around $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), which was raised by Children First Foundation.\n\n\"We're now blowing bubbles and doing high fives, they love it when we're watching the Wiggles -- they'll do little dance moves with their hands and what-not,\" Channel 7 reported Collins as saying during a press conference.\n\n\"It's really nice to see them separated. But they're still really happy about wanting to be close to one another.\"\n\nDifficult surgery\n\nConjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% are female, and they are always identical twins.\n\nScientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.\n\n\"The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThey were previously commonly referred to as \"Siamese twins,\" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. Never separated, they lived to the age of 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them.\n\nPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Parents accuse CDC of not reporting children's deaths from polio-like AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/o2QBtMJhUpM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Moseley, Virginia (CNN) Parents of children who had a horrifying polio-like illness are accusing the Centers for Disease Control of hiding the deaths of two children who suffered from the condition.\n\nThe parents say by not publicly acknowledging the two deaths, the agency is intentionally downplaying the severity of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a disease that paralyzes healthy children in a matter of hours.\n\n\"I feel like they're just sugar-coating this,\" said Katie Bustamante, whose son Alex, age 6, died in May. \"It eliminates my trust in the CDC.\"\n\nTheir accusations come amid a wave of criticism from parents of children with AFM and from some of the CDC's own medical advisers. In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness, and 162 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Stephen Barclay named new Brexit Secretary", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46241693", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:00:17", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nStephen Barclay has been confirmed as the new Brexit Secretary as Theresa May seeks to fill posts in her cabinet.\n\nThe MP for North East Cambridgeshire and Leave supporter had been serving as a minister at the department for health and social care.\n\nHe replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned on Thursday over Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for Brexit.\n\nA spokesman for No 10 indicated that Mr Barclay would focus on the domestic preparations rather than negotiations.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Stephen Barclay's appointment changes absolutely nothing.\n\n\"After two years of negotiation, the prime minister has failed to deliver a Brexit deal that can command the support of Parliament.\n\n\"A new face in the Brexit department will do nothing to bring this divided government back together.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after Amber Rudd was named the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey, who also resigned over the PM's Brexit plans on Thursday.\n\nMs Rudd said she was \"delighted\" to be given the role, and saw it as her job to \"try to iron out\" the issues with Universal Credit.\n\nStephen Hammond will take over from Mr Barclay at the department for health and social care.\n\nThe government also announced replacements for two junior ministers who resigned over Mrs May's deal.\n\nJohn Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara, and Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nMr Barclay - a former banker - has also held the posts of City minister and a whip at the Treasury.\n\nBBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said he was not a household name and it was a big promotion for him.\n\nBut he also described Mr Barclay as ultra-loyal, having never rebelled against the government.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove is understood to have turned down the role of Brexit secretary following Mr Raab's departure.\n\nMr Barclay becomes the third Brexit Secretary since the role was created, after Mr Raab and David Davis - who resigned over Mrs May's Brexit plans in July.\n\nHe has been congratulated on Twitter by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, who said he was \"a star\" when he worked in her department.\n\nMrs May agreed a draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit with her cabinet on Wednesday, which had already been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU.\n\nBut it led to a backlash from some Brexit-supporting MPs, including Mr Raab and Ms McVey.\n\nAround 20 Tory MPs have publicly called for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, with more thought to have written to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to call for a vote on her leadership.\n\nBut Mrs May responded to critics saying she will stay in No 10 and see the deal through.\n\nMs Rudd called on her colleagues to \"think again\" about sending letters against the PM, saying her deal was a \"practical response to leaving the European Union.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is not a time for changing our leader.

against Donald Trump continues.\n\nMr Acosta's press pass was taken after he clashed with the president during a news conference earlier this month.\n\nThe judge said the White House decision likely violated the journalist's right to due process and freedom of speech.\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Mr Acosta praised the decision and told reporters \"let's go back to work\".\n\nWhite House

for the first amendment and journalism\".\n\nHow did the row begin?\n\nMr Acosta was barred from entering the White House a day after he had a heated exchange with President Trump during a news conference on 8 November.\n\nA White House intern tried to take the microphone from Mr Acosta as he attempted to ask the president a follow-up question.\n\nIn a statement Mrs Sanders claimed that he had put \"his hands on a young woman\" during the exchange, during which Mr Trump called the reporter \"a rude, terrible person\".\n\nCNN sued to have Mr Acosta's pass restored, and their lawsuit was

extended legal battle.\n\nJudge Kelly said he was not ruling on the merits of this case, but that the White House did not provide sufficient justification for revoking Acosta's credentials.\n\nThat shouldn't come as much of a shock, given that the administration's explanation for the move has shifted multiple times, from a tenuous allegation that the CNN reporter \"placed his hands\" on a White House intern to a more general assertion that he violated press conference decorum.\n\nWhat's left to be decided after further hearings and court filings - assuming the case proceeds - is how much power a president has in determining which reporters get to have, and keep, access to the White House.\n\nAn administration has discretion to limit the number of passes it gives out, but the balancing of executive power and press rights gets trickier when government officials try to take media credentials away.\n\nWhat did the judge say?\n\nJudge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by Mr Trump last year, said Mr Acosta's constitutional rights outweighed the White House's right to have an orderly news conference, the Washington Post reported.\n\nHe also criticised the Trump administration's decision, saying that the process was \"so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me... who made the decision\".\n\nHe also called Mrs Sanders' statement claiming that Mr Acosta had inappropriately touched an intern \"belated efforts [that] were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process\".\n\nBut in court documents, the White House argued that the decision was made in order to preserve White House decorum and it did not claim impropriety towards the intern.\n\nJudge Kelly added that the White House was required to restore his White House access, but is under no obligation to call on him during questions.\n\nA hearing on the case is scheduled for next week, but it is unclear if the White House will once again seek to strip Mr Acosta's access, or allow him to resume his work as CNN's chief White House correspondent.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nIn a statement, CNN said: \"We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in

poverty\n\nMinisters are in a \"state of denial\" about poverty, a UN expert has said following a 12-day tour of the UK.\n\nPhilip Alston, special rapporteur on extreme poverty, said despite being in the one of the world's richest countries he had encountered \"misery\".\n\nLevels of child poverty are \"staggering\" and 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, the Australian said.\n\nThe government rejected his analysis, pointing to rising household incomes.\n\nProf Alston, an expert in human rights law based at New York University, visited locations including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Essex, Glasgow, London and Newcastle on a fact-finding mission.\n\nHe met people affected by poverty as well as government officials, discussing the impact of austerity, changes to benefits and local government funding.\n\nAt a news conference in London, he said he witnessed \"a lot of misery, a lot of people who feel the system is failing them, a lot of people who feel the system is really just there to punish them\".\n\nQuoting figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, he said that more than 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, meaning they lived on less than \u00a370 a week or went without essentials such as housing, food, clothing or heating.\n\nA fifth of the population, amounting to 14 million people, are living in poverty, Prof Alston said.\n\nHow is poverty measured?\n\nProf Alston used a new measure by the Social Metrics Commission to come up with the figure of 14m people in the UK in poverty.\n\nIt is a measure of \"relative poverty\", meaning it looks at the percentage of people living with less than 55% of the median income, taking into account costs such as childcare, housing, debt and disability.\n\nBut the government has preferred to use the measure of \"absolute poverty\".\n\nThis counts the number of people in households with less than 60% of the median income as it was in 2010/11, so it shows how living standards of low-income households have changed over time.\n\nBy that measure, the government says there are a million fewer people in absolute poverty than there were in 2010.\n\nAmong experts in the media, think tanks, Parliament and organisations such as the National Audit Office, Prof Alston said there was \"close to unanimity\" that Britain was not doing enough to combat poverty.\n\nBut he said the view from ministers was the opposite.\n\n\"Ministers with whom I met told me that things are going well that they don't see any big problems and they are happy with the way their policies are playing out,\" Prof Alston said.\n\nImage copyright Bassam Khawaja Image caption Mr Alston met human rights workers and residents in deprived parts of Belfast\n\nHe said the government was preoccupied with reducing welfare dependency but said he could not believe ministers were as happy with the results as they claimed to be.\n\nProf Alston said: \"The era of connectivity and the era of social media makes it much less sustainable to have this dramatic difference between people living the high life, a higher life than has ever been lived before, and at the other end, people who can't afford a tin of beans, can't afford the seventh meal of the week.\"\n\nThe approach to benefits was \"punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous\", he said.\n\nHe gave the example of \"draconian sanctions\" which shut people out from the benefits system for weeks or months at a time, sometimes for minor infringements such as missing an appointment.\n\nProf Alston claimed many of the \"harsh\" policies could be ended \"overnight\" at little cost.\n\nThese included the delay of five to 12 weeks before Universal Credit was paid, the single household payments which give more leverage to controlling or violent partners, and the two-child limit for benefit claimants.\n\nProf Alston compared this limit to China's notorious one-child policy and said it was \"a perfect way to punish families\".\n\nHe warned that the poor would \"bear the brunt\" of the expected impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and said the fall in the value of the pound had already cost low-income families \u00a3400 a year.\n\n\"In my meetings with the government, it was clear to me that the impact of Brexit on people in poverty is an afterthought,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Jaywick, Essex, pictured in 2015, was one of the towns visited for the UN report\n\nProf Alston's report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva next year.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"We completely disagree with this analysis.\"\n\nShe said that household incomes have \"never been higher\", income inequality has fallen and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010.\n\nIt is not the first time the UK has been criticised by UN special rapporteurs, who are are independent human rights experts appointed for fact-finding and monitoring missions around the world.\n\nIn 2014, urban planning expert Raquel Rolnik said the \"bedroom tax\", which meant social housing tenants with spare rooms had to pay more rent or move somewhere smaller, undermined the right to adequate housing.\n\nOn that occasion, ministers said her report was a \"misleading Marxist diatribe\" and made an official complaint to the UN."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Three myths about Florida elections recount", "article_link":

Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract its force.\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table' (acknowledge the issue, rather than leaving it), so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been observed under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

in a significant increase in CO\u2082 emissions, scientists warn.\n\nThat could mean attaining the Paris climate agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2C could become harder, they say.\n\nPresent emission-cut pledges by countries are projected to increase the average global temperature rise by more than 3C by the end of the century.\n\nThat would lead to dangerous climate change impacts, experts say.\n\nThese include sea level rise, drought, wildfires, among other extreme events.\n\n\"We can't neglect the emissions from wildfires,\" says Ramon Vallejo, a scientist specialising on fire ecology with the University of Barcelona.\n\n\"Particularly now that we are seeing intense wildfires all around the world.\"\n\nEstimates and uncertainties\n\nAlthough estimates vary and still carry uncertainties, some experts say wildfires account for up to 20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey are estimated to increase by a few percent to roughly 30% by the end of this century depending on how the climate changes.\n\n\"It is a double whammy,\" said William Lau, atmospheric scientist with Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\n\"Big forest fires first lead to significant reduction of forests that suck in CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and the second loss is they cause significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nA study earlier this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and savannah had been converted to land for crops over the past few decades and therefore wildfires had decreased.\n\nThe research, however, found that the drop was not huge though.\n\nIntense wildfires\n\nThe reason behind that, experts say, is the significantly increased intensity and size of wildfires.\n\nThat is why, they add, there are now concerns over possible notable rise of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe total global CO\u2082 emissions reached 32.5 billion tons last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Embers blow in the wind during this year's wildfires in California\n\nThere has, however, not been an exact quantification of emissions from recent wildfires and the one in California now.\n\nSome estimates suggest that the wildfire in northern California last year emitted as much CO\u2082 in a week as what all of the cars and trucks in the state do in a year.\n\nThat is why some fire experts in that US state fear that its level of CO\u2082 emissions could endanger its progress toward meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\nOther hotspots\n\nWhile California and Australia are most of the time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE) has a similar view.\n\n\"These (California) fires are likely fairly insignificant in terms of their global contribution to greenhouse gases,\" he said.\n\n\"At any one time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is something under your control,\" says Professor Vallejo.\n\n\"But wildfires are not something controllable like that. They will happen and will intensify in a warming world.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Exoplanet discovered around neighbouring star", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46196279", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ESO/M.

It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M.

The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report says 'cut lamb and beef'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46214864", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says.\n\nThe shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.\n\nThe report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.\n\nThe farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers.\n\nBut environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid.\n\nThe CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.\n\nThe un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2.\n\nThe committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.\n\nBBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU.\n\nTurning farmland into forests\n\nThe chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.\n\n\u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nCarbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs.\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report.

Bank - Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have continued to protest against a controversial social security law, which came into effect at the start of the month.\n\nThe latest of several demonstrations against the law was held in the city of Ramallah on Monday, where thousands of workers staged a sit-in outside the Palestinian government headquarters.\n\n\"The government is not listening to our concerns,\" said Jack Syriani, a worker at the Jerusalem School of Bethlehem and member of the National Social Security movement (NSSM), which has headed opposition to the law.\n\n\"We wanted to modify this law, but the government has refused to hear our concerns. Now we want it cancelled completely,\" he said.\n\nOpposition to the law ranges from concerns that monthly employee deductions will be unmanageable for workers, to fears over the long-term security of their contributions and the viability of the system under a military occupation.\n\nOther protesters on Monday called for the law to be frozen temporarily to allow for negotiations with the government.\n\nSocial security coverage for private sector\n\nThe social security law was first signed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2016 by presidential decree, but its implementation was delayed for two years to allow companies and workers time to prepare.\n\nIts aim is to provide social security coverage to private sector employees, who make up around 53 percent of the workforce in the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nThe first phase of the law took effect on November 1 and consists of monthly employee and employer contributions to the newly established Palestinian Social Security Corporation (PSSC), for the management of retirement pensions, insurance for work-related injuries and maternity leave.\n\nThe PSSC also receives funding in the form of grants, donations and loans.\n\nEmployees who work more than 16 days a month are expected to contribute seven percent of their monthly salaries to the PSSC, while employers will contribute nine percent of salaries, plus an additional 1.6 percent to cover accident insurance.\n\nAccording to the law, workers will be able to apply for a retirement pension at age 60.\n\nSyriani told Al Jazeera that the seven percent deductions would make life difficult for Palestinians who are already burdened by personal debt.\n\n\"If a worker is making 2,000 ($541) or 2,500 shekels ($677) a month, he already has to pay half of that to the bank to pay off loans,\" he said, adding that many Palestinians have become dependent on loans and often use the funds to purchase cars, homes, or other consumer goods.\n\n\"On top of the loan payments, then the social security company also takes from his salary. How can he live with the remaining money? He will not be able to afford to provide a good life for his family or children.\"\n\nPalestinian Labour Minister Mamoun Abu Shahla - who has become the focus of demonstrators' anger, with many calling for his resignation - told Al Jazeera that the workers have rejected the bill because \"some of them are unable to understand the law properly.\"\n\nHe added that although the law will not be delayed, a \"special committee\" consisting of eight government ministers has been formed in order to \"open a dialogue with all the parties who are against the bill\".\n\nEmployees and employers who do not register will not be penalised until negotiations are complete, which could take anywhere from a few weeks to six months, Abu Shahla said.\n\nAt that point, the law will become compulsory for all of society, he added.\n\n'Nothing is ever guaranteed in Palestine'\n\nFadi Arouri, a journalist who also works at an international humanitarian NGO, told Al Jazeera that the economic and political situation in the occupied territory makes the national social security system unviable.\n\n\"We are not stable,\" he said. \"We are not controlling our own exports and imports. We don't have our own currency. Our government is financed by [international] aid.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"If something happens, no one is going to save the people, and the national security law will not be valued in a country under debt,\" he added. \"We don't even control our own economy. How can we be sure that our money will be secure?\"\n\nFor Syriani, the main concern for Palestinians is the lack of a guarantee that the money will still be there when workers reach retirement age.\n\nHe said workers are demanding that a \"special court\" be established to provide workers with legal recourse that can guarantee that their contributions to the social security fund are not lost.\n\nPalestinians have also lived under an Israeli military occupation for more than half a century, which limits the independence and control that the Palestinian Authority (PA) practically exercises over its territory, which consists of about 18 percent of the West Bank known as Area A.\n\n\"What if something happens with the political situation? Who is responsible for ensuring that we don't lose out money? Nothing is ever guaranteed in Palestine,\" Syriani told Al Jazeera.\n\nAre the workers represented?\n\nA major demand among protesters is the restructure of the PSSC board to include more representation of workers, in order to ensure the funds are being invested for their benefit. Currently, only five of 18 board members represent their interests.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"There are some board members who are investors and businessmen. How can we know, as workers, that they would not be directly or indirectly benefited from the investments of the funds?\" Arouri said.\n\nJabril Saadah, the head researcher at the Ramallah-based Bisan Center for Research and Development, told Al Jazeera that these suspicions arise from a history of widespread corruption and nepotism practised by Palestinian leaders, many of whom have ties to some of the largest companies in Palestine.\n\nAbu Shahla has been accused by protesters of personal involvement in the selection of Bank of Palestine as the financial body to manage the social security funds, owing to his own personal ties with the bank, where he has previously served on the board of directors and continues to own stock.\n\nHowever, Abu Shahla has denied this accusation, telling Al Jazeera that the bank was chosen by a \"special committee\" and the PSSC board because it is the largest bank in Palestine and has branches in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\n\"I am only a minister now and I am only here to help my people,\" he said.\n\nIn an apparent concession to the protesters' demands, Abu Shahla told Al Jazeera that discussions are underway to establish a \"general assembly\" made up of 50 Palestinian citizens that would oversee the activities of the board.\n\nWorkers, meanwhile, told Al Jazeera that the first phase of the law should also cover other aspects of the society's needs, such as the implementation of unemployment insurance and healthcare.\n\nWhile Abu Shahla said these benefits would come at later stages, he noted that there was no set timeframe for their future implementation, and that it would depend on the economic and political situation.\n\nHowever, Palestinian workers believe these issues and reforms should have been addressed and implemented before the law went into effect, in order to build confidence in the system among employees in the occupied territory. Instead, they say that the new law leaves them facing an uncertain future."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Chilli paste, books and chairs thrown in Sri Lanka parliament", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/pandemonium-sri-lanka-parliament-mps-hurl-books-speaker-181116121100915.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Sri Lanka's parliament has descended into chaos for a second day as legislators supporting disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa threw books, furniture and chilli paste at rivals in a bid to block a second no-confidence motion against him.\n\nThe pandemonium on Friday began when the pro-Rajapaksa politicians poured on to the floor of parliament and prevented Speaker Karu Jayasuriya from taking his chair.\n\nAfter more than an hour, Jayasuriya managed to finally enter the red-carpeted chamber under the protection of dozens of unarmed officers and parliamentary staff.\n\nRioting legislators then took away the ceremonial chair, but staff carried in an ordinary office chair as a makeshift replacement.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.\u201d\n\nDeVos previously said the existing rules pressure schools to take heavy action against students accused of misconduct without giving them a fair chance to defend themselves.\n\nHer new proposal adds several provisions meant to protect accused students. They would be allowed to review and respond to all evidence collected by the school, for example, and have a presumption of innocence throughout the disciplinary process.\n\nThey could cross-examine their accusers, although it would be done indirectly through a representative to avoid personal confrontation.\n\nOpponents say the proposal would deter victims from reporting assaults, and allow schools to shirk responsibility when they do receive complaints.\n\n\u201cIf these draft rules go into effect, schools will become more dangerous for all students and more schools will shield harassers and rapists,\u201d Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said in a statement.\n\nVirginia Rep.

Colleges were required to investigate all student complaints, on campus or off, and any misstep could put them under federal investigation.\n\nAdvocacy groups for victims say the Obama rules forced schools to stop sweeping the issue under the rug, while advocates for accused students say it tipped the scales in favor of accusers. Some college leaders complained that the rules were too complex and could be overly burdensome.\n\nDeVos rescinded an important guidance letter in September 2017, declaring that \u201cthe era of \u2018rule by letter\u2019\u201d was over. In its place, she issued the 150-page proposal released Friday.\n\nAmong other changes, it narrows what constitutes sexual harassment. While the 2011 guidance defined it as \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,\u201d the new proposal defines it as unwelcome sexual conduct that\u2019s so severe \u201cit effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d\n\nIt also allows schools to use a higher standard of proof when weighing cases. The Obama guidance told schools to use a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, meaning the allegation is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d true. The new proposal would allow a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard, meaning the claim is highly probable.\n\nEven if victims don\u2019t file a formal complaint, the proposal encourages schools to offer a range of measures to help them continue their studies, including counseling, class schedule changes, dorm room reassignments and no-contact orders for those accused of harming them.\n\nIt has yet to be seen whether schools would change policies in response to the rules. A statement from the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities says it expects schools to \u201cfar exceed\u201d the minimum that\u2019s required in Title IX rules.\n\nBefore the rules can be finalized, the Education Department will gather public input from the public."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Says He Has Finished Answers to Special Counsel's Questions", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-has-finished-answers-to-special-counsel-s-questions/4661889.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had completed his written answers for the federal investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016election, but had not yet submitted them to the U.S. Special Counsel's Office.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he wrote the answers to the questions himself, not his lawyers.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump to Honor Donor's Wife with Presidential Award", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-honor-donor-s-wife-with-presidential-award-/4661861.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Miriam Adelson is a doctor, philanthropist and humanitarian, but is perhaps best known as the wife of Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate considered one of the nation's most powerful Republican donors.

Their passion for strengthening the country, along with Israel-U.S. relations, has helped keep such policy priorities as relocating the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem front and center in the Republican Party and the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nTrump moved the embassy in May, and Sheldon Adelson, who had offered to personally fund the move, sat in the front row for the ceremony.\n\n\n\nRobert Weissman, president of the public interest group Public Citizen, questioned whether the decision to recognize Miriam Adelson was based on merit.\n\n\n\n\"It's emblematic of the corrupt and transactional presidency of Donald Trump, and it is a shame, but not a surprise, that he is corroding and corrupting a civic treasure, an honor like the Medal of Freedom,\" Weissman said.\n\n\n\nElliott Abrams, who held foreign policy roles under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, called the complaints \"ridiculous.\" Abrams noted that Miriam Adelson has donated her time and her money to combatting addiction. He contrasted her award with those given by President Barack Obama to Chita Rivera, Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand, Ellen DeGeneres and Warren Buffett, among others.\n\n\n\n\"People who said nothing about all of that and now criticize the medal for Dr. Adelson are simply being nasty and partisan, and are not actually taking a look at her remarkable knowledge and charity in the chemical addiction field,'' Abrams said.\n\n\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump used the process follow by previous administrations to settle on his group of honorees. It was coordinated by the staff secretary's office, incorporating recommendations from the public, relevant presidential advisory bodies, the Cabinet and senior White House staff, she said.\n\n\n\nThe award is given to individuals \"who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\"\n\n\n\nMiriam Adelson said she is \"deeply humbled and moved by this exceptional honor.\"\n\n\n\n\"Liberty is at the heart of my decades of work against substance abuse. Drug dependency is enslavement, for the user and his or her family and society, and treatment an emancipation,\" she said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\n\nE. Fletcher McClellan, a political science professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, said presidents have no limits on making these awards.\n\n\n\n\"He has total discretion as to who and when and how,\" said McClellan, who has studied the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\n\nChristopher Devine, a politics professor at the University of Dayton, questioned Miriam Adelson's impact on American culture or national interests as compared to past recipients like Oprah Winfrey or Bruce Springsteen. Both Winfrey and Springsteen received medals from Obama, whom they supported politically.\n\n\n\n\"This is what leaves many people wondering whether President Trump singled her out for an award as something of a thank-you for her and husband Sheldon Adelson's very substantial donations to Republican candidates and causes over the years, including ones in support of Trump's election in 2016,\" said Devine, who wrote a book about the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\n\nDevine said that while Miriam Adelson isn't the first campaign contributor to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the size of her campaign contributions sets her apart from the rest.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Votes Hand Recounted in Florida US Senate Race", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-hand-recount-begins-for-tight-us-senate-race/4661798.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "A hand recount of the votes cast in Florida's U.S. Senate race began Friday after a federal judge angrily told election officials they are making a mockery of the state around the globe.\n\n\"We have been the laughingstock of the world election after election, but we've still chosen not to fix this,\" an angry Walker said Thursday.\n\nHis remarks were an apparent reference to the 2000 presidential election which had to be decided by the Supreme Court when a state-wide vote recount in Florida was turning into a mess of confusion, charges, and counter charges.\n\nFlorida law requires a hand recount if a machine count finds the margin of victory is less than 0.25 percent.\n\n\n\nAs of late Thursday, Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson trailed his Republican challenger, Governor Rick Scott, by just 0.15 percent.\n\n\n\nElection officials missed a Thursday deadline for recounting the ballots for the Senate, saying counting machines in Palm Beach kept breaking down.\n\n\n\nOfficials in Tampa Bay declined to turn in their recount result because it came up more than 800 votes short of the original election day tally.\n\n\n\nFederal Judge Mark Walker refused to extend the deadline and berated election officials for not anticipating problems.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have filed a number of lawsuits relating to vote counting.\n\nHe was no doubt also thinking about the 2000 presidential election which had to be decided by the Supreme Court when a state-wide vote recount in Florida was turning into a mess of confusion, charges, and counter charges.\n\n\n\nJudge Walker has also given voters until Saturday afternoon to correct their ballots if they weren't counted because of mismatched signatures.\n\n\n\nFlorida officials testified in court that nearly 4,000 ballots had already been rejected by local election officials because the signatures mailed in didn't match the signature on file.

The blaze reduced it to ashes, having destroyed nearly 12,000 structures, including at least 9,700 homes, and still threatens thousands of additional structures.\n\nThe large number of missing people likely includes those who fled the fire and don't realize they have been reported missing, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. Honea said a list of the missing was publicized so people can see if they are on it and inform authorities they survived.\n\nWhen the fire broke out last week, Honea said, \"The chaos that we were dealing with was extraordinary. Now we're trying to go back out and make sure that we're accounting for everyone.\"\n\nThe blaze forced the evacuation of some 52,000 people who are staying in shelters, motels, homes of relatives and friends, motels and at a makeshift camp on a nearby Walmart parking lot and an adjacent field.\n\nOne evacuee, Paradise resident Harold Taylor, told The Associated Press, \"We didn't have 10 minutes to get out of there. It was already in flames downtown, all of the local restaurants and stuff.\"\n\nTaylor said he unsuccessfully sought to convince a neighbor to escape with him and does not know what happened to him.\n\nSheriff Honea said the remains of seven more victims were recovered Thursday, raising the death toll to 63. Officials say they hope a Rapid DNA analysis technique will help speed the identification of victims and notification of their families.\n\nThe 570 square kilometer Camp Fire was 40-percent contained Thursday, but authorities could not predict when evacuees would be able to return to the area. Authorities said conditions are still too dangerous, citing ongoing firefighting efforts, downed power lines and road closures.\n\nThe cause of the Camp Fire remains under investigation, but officials have said they are investigating the possibility it was sparked by electrical equipment.\n\nWildfires are common in California, particularly at this time of year when warm, dry winds help fan the flames. At the southern end of California, firefighters and rescue workers have been grappling with other wildfires, including the Woosley Fire that killed three people and burned at least 500 structures near the Malibu coast near Los Angeles.\n\nThe Woosley Fire, which torched nearly 390 square kilometers, roughly the size of the western city of Denver, Colorado, was about 60 percent contained, allowing more residents to return to the area.\n\nThe White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump would visit California on Saturday to meet with \"individuals impacted by the wildfires.\" He plans to travel to both regions of California that have been devastated by the blazes.\n\nTrump's visit comes a week after he initially blamed California officials for the wildfires and threatened to withhold federal money. His tweets did not mention California's drought conditions, which many scientists say are symptomatic of climate change.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Brock Long, head of the emergency management agency, FEMA, visited the Paradise area on Wednesday. Brown blamed climate change and drought for the massive blaze, while Zinke cautioned against assigning blame to any one factor.\n\n\"Now is not the time to point fingers,\" Zinke said, saying dead trees, higher temperatures, and poor forest management were among the causes.\n\nLong said it will take years for residents of Paradise to rebuild, if they choose to do so at all."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Says He Has Finished Answers to Special Counsel's Questions", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-has-finished-answers-to-special-counsel-s-questions/4661889.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had completed his written answers for the federal investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016election, but had not yet submitted them to the U.S. Special Counsel's Office.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he wrote the answers to the questions himself, not his lawyers.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Votes Hand Recounted in Florida US Senate Race", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-hand-recount-begins-for-tight-us-senate-race/4661798.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "A hand recount of the votes cast in Florida's U.S. Senate race began Friday after a federal judge angrily told election officials they are making a mockery of the state around the globe.\n\n\"We have been the laughingstock of the world election after election, but we've still chosen not to fix this,\" an angry Walker said Thursday.\n\nHis remarks were an apparent reference to the 2000 presidential election which had to be decided by the Supreme Court when a state-wide vote recount in Florida was turning into a mess of confusion, charges, and counter charges.\n\nFlorida law requires a hand recount if a machine count finds the margin of victory is less than 0.25 percent.\n\n\n\nAs of late Thursday, Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson trailed his Republican challenger, Governor Rick Scott, by just 0.15 percent.\n\n\n\nElection officials missed a Thursday deadline for recounting the ballots for the Senate, saying counting machines in Palm Beach kept breaking down.\n\n\n\nOfficials in Tampa Bay declined to turn in their recount result because it came up more than 800 votes short of the original election day tally.\n\n\n\nFederal Judge Mark Walker refused to extend the deadline and berated election officials for not anticipating problems.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have filed a number of lawsuits relating to vote counting.\n\nHe was no doubt also thinking about the 2000 presidential election which had to be decided by the Supreme Court when a state-wide vote recount in Florida was turning into a mess of confusion, charges, and counter charges.\n\n\n\nJudge Walker has also given voters until Saturday afternoon to correct their ballots if they weren't counted because of mismatched signatures.\n\n\n\nFlorida officials testified in court that nearly 4,000 ballots had already been rejected by local election officials because the signatures mailed in didn't match the signature on file.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889.\n\nBut now, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card.

Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses decay over time.\n\nBenefits of the change\n\nThe change will have no discernable impact for most people. Bathroom scales won't suddenly get kinder and kilos and grams won't change in supermarkets.\n\nBut the new formula-based definition of the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that set the standard from the 19th century to the 21st, through periods of stunning human achievement and stunning follies, including two world wars.\n\nUnlike a physical object, the new formula for the kilo, now also known as \"the electric kilo,\" cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time, or be dropped and damaged.\n\nIt is expected to be more accurate when measuring very, very small or very, very large masses and help usher in new innovations in science, industry, climate study and other fields.\n\nWith time, as the science behind the new definition becomes more accessible and affordable, it should also mean that countries won't have to send their own kilograms back to France to be checked occasionally against Le Grand K, as they have done until now, to see whether their mass was still accurate."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Somalia Struggles to Treat PTSD from War, Poverty", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-struggles-to-treat-ptsd-from-war-poverty/4661120.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Somalia's 30 years of chronic conflict have left an estimated 1 in 3 people affected by mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

He hopped barefoot from the prow, climbed a muddy slope and stared once more at what he'd lost.\n\nNot long ago, the clearing had been home to mangroves, saltwater-loving trees that anchor a web of life stretching from fish larvae hatching in the cradle of their underwater roots to the hornbills squawking at their crown. Now the trees' benevolent presence was gone, in their place a swath of stripped soil littered with felled trunks as gray as fossils.\n\n\"Do you think we can find any food in this place now?\" asked Bondien, a village leader of the Tombonuo people. \"The company thinks it can do anything it wants \u2014 that we don't count.\"\n\nThe company is Sunlight Inno Seafood. Owned by Cedric Wong King Ti, a Malaysian businessman known as \"King Wong,\" it has bulldozed swaths of mangroves in the Tombonuo's homeland in northern Borneo to make space for plastic-lined ponds filled with millions of king prawns. The shrimp are destined to be fattened for three months, scooped up in nets, quick-frozen, packed into 40-foot refrigerated containers and loaded onto cargo ships bound for distant ports.\n\nGargantuan as it may seem to Bondien and his relatives, the project represents only a speck in the global aquaculture industry, one of the world's fastest-growing sources of protein.\n\nUnfolding across Asia and around the world, this revolution in farming could help mitigate the impacts of climate change \u2014 or make them even worse.\n\nAs the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases causes the world's oceans to warm, ecosystems that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago are being upended in less than a human lifespan. Across the planet, fish and other marine creatures are being forced into a desperate search for cooler waters. Even coral is on the move: Some Japanese reefs are expanding northward at up to nearly nine miles per year, researchers have found.\n\nTropical seas may be the hardest hit. Species in the once-stable conditions near the equator could find it much harder to tolerate even mild temperature increases than hardier cousins at higher latitudes, which are used to coping with the contrast between summer and winter.\n\n\"If you ask me what is the No. 1 concern that I have on climate change effects on fisheries, it is on these tropical, developing countries,\" said William Cheung, director of science at the Nippon Foundation-University of British Columbia Nereus Program. \"The sheer speed of the change will make it that much harder for marine life to adapt.\"\n\nCoral reefs, as vital to tropical fish as trees are to birds, are becoming more vulnerable to a process called bleaching, which occurs when a spike in water temperatures causes coral to expel the algae that provide their kaleidoscopic colors, leaving them prone to starvation or disease. Today, swaths of the once-psychedelic Great Barrier Reef in Australia have turned boneyard white and largely devoid of life.\n\nScientists fear a similar fate could await the Coral Triangle, a huge underwater wonderland east of Borneo endowed with a trove of biodiversity comparable to the rainforests of the Amazon Basin. Millions of people depend on its bounty to survive, a large share of them Malaysians, who eat an average of 125 pounds of fish each a year \u2014 more than double the world average.\n\nWith climate change bearing down on the tropics, the search is on for a more sustainable way of getting food from the sea, one that doesn't take more than nature can give.\n\nFarther to the north on Borneo, an island divided among Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, villagers are raising sea cucumbers: curious-looking creatures resembling giant slugs that are typically braised and served with oysters, mushrooms and spring onions, or \u2014 if you're in Japan \u2014 thinly sliced, flavored with wasabi and eaten raw.\n\nThese echinoderms, close relatives of sea urchins and starfish, may not appeal to every palate. But farming them has one of the lightest footprints of any form of food production, a reminder of the vast untapped global potential for harvesting oysters, mussels, clams and many other types of filter-feeders.\n\nA couple of hours' drive from the Sunlight Seafood shrimp farm, inhabitants of the stilted village of Mapan Mapan have created a maze of sunken enclosures fenced with a barnacle-covered mesh.\n\nImmersed waist-deep in one of these briny paddocks, sea-cucumber farmer Astinah Binti Jamari plucked one of the sandpaper-skinned creatures from the seabed. It responded by squirting her with a jet of saltwater \u2014 a defense normally used to scare away crabs.\n\nA revolution in fish\n\nForty years ago, only 5 percent of the world's fish production was farmed. After decades of rapid growth, aquaculture reached a tipping point in 2013, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, when the amount the industry raised in cages, tanks and ponds outweighed the tonnage of freely swimming fish hauled from lakes, rivers and seas for people's plates.\n\n\u200bIn many respects, the industry has a good-news story to tell. Farmed salmon, for example, can convert feed into edible protein far more efficiently than cows or pigs, while producing fewer greenhouse gases. Now, almost all the salmon sold in restaurants and supermarkets is raised in captivity, with Norway, Chile and Scotland the biggest producers.\n\nBut this phenomenal expansion has come at a cost. The appetite for farmed species is so voracious, almost 20 percent of the annual catch from the world's seas is ground into fishmeal, a nutrient-rich powder that forms the basis of the feeds used from salmon cages in Scottish lochs to shrimp ponds on Borneo. Vast amounts of fish have been taken from poorer countries to feed species destined for the plates of wealthier consumers. In addition, shrimp farms, in particular, have made coastal communities in the tropics even more vulnerable by cutting down mangroves, their first line of defense against extreme weather and rising sea levels.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, the aquaculture industry has led to the destruction of more than 1.3 million acres of mangroves spread across Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil and Ecuador, according to a 2013 paper in the Bulletin of Marine Science. Untreated waste and epidemics of shrimp-killing diseases mean the gains can be short-lived: A study published this year identified more than half a million acres of abandoned shrimp ponds in Indonesia alone.\n\nNevertheless, some governments in Southeast Asia and Latin America have concluded that it's worth sacrificing more mangroves in return for the export earnings and employment the projects can generate. Among them is the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is a partner in King Wong's shrimp farm.\n\nHope of a better life\n\nIn 2013, representatives of Sunlight Seafood offered leaders of the Tombonuo and other indigenous communities a deal. In return for some of the land flanking the tidal creeks where their mangroves stood, locals recalled, the company would provide running water, electricity and much-needed employment for youths in the surrounding area, known as Pitas.\n\nFive years since the bulldozers went to work, Tombonuo community leaders say they've lost more than 2,000 acres of mangroves and that the jobs and infrastructure they were promised haven't materialized.\n\n\"I have no words. It's like we've lost our whole world,\" said Samad Samayong, a Tombonuo elder, surveying a sacred outcrop consecrated by his ancestors that is now encircled by shrimp ponds. \"We only realized what was happening when it was too late.\"\n\nOn the other side of a fence, a lone worker trudged past carrying a large bag of Royal Dragon brand shrimp feed on his shoulder. He didn't seem to notice Samayong and other Tombonuo watching from the trees.\n\nSunlight Seafood didn't respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment made by telephone, email and a letter hand-delivered to its office in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah. Reuters also contacted a law firm in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, that had acted for the company in the past but received no reply.\n\nSunlight Seafood has issued statements to Borneo media saying the project was built on land long earmarked for aquaculture by government officials, and that it is boosting the economy in Pitas, one of the poorest districts in Sabah.\n\nThe sheer scale of the farm is only fully apparent from up close. In July, a Reuters reporter and photographer accompanied Samayong, Bondien and others on a three-boat party to various points where water from the ponds gushed from pipes, leaving foamy trails of scum in the creeks.\n\nIt took hours to trace even a portion of the fence enclosing the site. The barrier's stark edges cut a jarring contrast to the tangle of mangrove roots straddling saltwater and land, their branches home to proboscis monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, blue-eared kingfishers and storks.\n\nThe Sabah Environmental Protection Association, a nongovernmental organization, says Sunlight Seafood has already cut down 2,300 acres of mangroves, citing satellite imagery.\n\n\"They cleared the mangroves with no proper consultation with the community,\" said the group's president, Lanash Thanda. \"They have to redress the wrong they have done.\"\n\nApart from losing more trees, Samayong and Bondien fear diggers will further encroach on their ancestral shrines, such as an eerie riverbank guarded by a spirit husband and wife.\n\nVisiting on his boat, Bondien dedicated a cigarette he had rolled from mangrove bark to the couple, placing it on an altar made of branches.\n\n\"It's not only the forest that's being destroyed,\" said Mastupang Somoi, another member of the Tombonuo. \"It's our identity.\"\n\nTrees provide buffer\n\nWith evidence mounting that mangroves represent an effective buffer against climate impacts, some tropical countries are starting to question the gusto with which they once felled the trees, which can take 15 years to mature.\n\nWere it not for the way mangroves served as shields, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami could have taken many more than 220,000 lives. The trees can also help mitigate the impact of rising sea levels: Their multi-tiered root systems trap sediment to raise the land around them relative to the encroaching waves.\n\nEqually ingeniously, mangroves sequester more greenhouse gases than almost any other type of forest, as well as serving as natural larders of fish, birds, fruit and the kind of snails you can eat raw by snapping their conical shells and sucking out the innards.\n\n\"If you catch a fish in the open sea or off a coral reef, it may well have spent part of its life in the mangroves,\" said Dan Friess, an associate professor of geography at the National University of Singapore.\n\nSabah's government says it is committed to striking a balance between economic development and preserving Borneo's extraordinary natural heritage, including by designating extensive areas of forest as nature reserves for threatened orangutans and creating Malaysia's largest marine protected area.\n\nEarlier this month, Junz Wong, Sabah's agriculture minister, toured the Sunlight Seafood farm and said the company had operated \"quite professionally\" and created nearly 400 jobs. On his Facebook page, Wong said he had rejected a company request to cut down an additional 1,000 acres of mangroves. \"I told them NO,\" he wrote. \"No more destroying of mangroves.\"\n\nIn July, a Reuters reporter visited Sunlight Seafood's offices in a suburb of Kota Kinabalu and hand-delivered a letter summarizing the Tombonuo community's grievances and requesting an interview with owner Wong or another company representative.\n\nWhile the reporter was explaining the purpose of the letter to a worker who had been sent to meet him at the door, a security guard cut their conversation short and escorted the reporter off the premises. The guard then closed the gate to the driveway. It bore a large sign in red letters warning that trespassers would be prosecuted.\n\n\u200bFood without a face\n\nNestled in sea-cucumber farmer Jamari's palm, the specimen she had fished from the seabed convulsed with a slow-motion shudder. Jamari, once a struggling single parent, says the creatures came to her rescue, earning her enough money to put her five children through school and build a new house.\n\n\"The sea cucumbers are my treasure chest,\" she said. \"I can't even imagine what life would be like without them.\"\n\nMapan Mapan has earned so much money from its sunken farms that it has declared an annual sea cucumber \"birthday\" festival, at which villagers give thanks by stewing a share of their harvest in a communal meal.\n\nChinese traders have been importing sea cucumbers for more than a thousand years. Served at royal banquets, they were considered both a status symbol and an aphrodisiac. A Ming Dynasty book published in 1602 called \"Miscellanies of Five Items\" lists them as \"sea ginseng.\"\n\nThis mystique drives much of the appetite today. In the decade that ended in 2016, global production of sea cucumbers more than doubled to nearly 275,000 tons, according to the FAO.\n\nAt top Chinese restaurants, the echinoderms are used to make one of the world's most expensive soups, a broth called Buddha Jumps Over the Wall that can sell for $400 and needs to be ordered five days in advance.\n\nIrwin Wong is a manager at Oceandrive, a Malaysian seafood company that buys the sea cucumbers for export. He served as an adviser when Mapan Mapan started cultivating the creatures eight years ago in a 20-farmer pilot project backed by the local government. He says the scheme is harvesting wild sea cucumbers at a sustainable rate, but that even better management could help Borneo produce many more.\n\n\"Perhaps this is the lowest impact of all aquaculture activities,\" Wong said, standing on a platform overlooking a planned new phase, to be built with barnacle-proof mesh and more durable epoxy-coated stakes. \"It can seriously go very big.\"\n\nResearchers believe there is enormous potential to scale up global production of plankton-eaters such as scallops, clams, oysters, cockles and other bivalves \u2014 and, of course, sea cucumbers.\n\n\"The current way of feeding ourselves is simply not sustainable,\" said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research in Bremen, Germany. \"I think on a global level we have to start thinking about the lower levels of the marine food chain, such as bivalves, when it comes to supplying our proteins.\"\n\nScientific advisers to the European Union agree. They concluded last year that it should be possible to harvest a combined 165 million tons annually of bivalves and seaweed \u2014 almost double the world's annual landings of wild-caught fish.\n\nThe beauty of these creatures is that, unlike farmed fish or prawns, they don't require any feed apart from the nutrients they absorb from the sea. No mangroves have to be felled to culture them. Neither do they spew tons of fish waste or chemical pollutants. In fact, bivalves actually remove toxins from the water; a single oyster filters 50 gallons of seawater a day.\n\nYet even as the risks posed by climate change bring the potential of shellfish, seaweed and sea cucumbers into sharper focus, it is also putting them in danger. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, seawater is rapidly becoming more acidic. There is already evidence that acidification can make mussels' shells more brittle, or weaken their grip on rocks, leaving them at greater risk of being swept away by advancing waves.\n\n\u200b\u2018Preserve every species\u2019\n\nLife has been kind to the prize specimens at the Borneo Marine Research Institute: mammoth tropical fish known as giant grouper, which can weigh as much as a person, and in some cases have been swimming in spirals in silo-like tanks for almost 20 years. The only drama happens at feeding time. When fresh sardines hit the surface, the fish dart through the water with torpedo force.\n\nTheir wild relatives will have to work a lot harder to survive. In experiments to simulate the effects of more acidic waters, the institute has found that grouper \u2014 a staple in the Coral Triangle \u2014 find it harder to reproduce, and their young don't develop properly. The findings have sharpened concerns about what climate change will mean for the region's marine life, already struggling with plastic pollution, runoff from oil palm plantations, damage to reefs by dynamite fishing and the loss of mangroves.\n\nShek Qin, a research assistant, visits the busy fish-landing quay at Kota Kinabalu two nights a week to monitor catches of sharks and rays. In the early hours of a July morning, she picked up a newly landed shark by its tail, plonked it onto the dock and cheerfully inserted her forefinger into its mouth, peering inside to inspect the teeth \u2014 a trick for classifying a specimen more accurately, especially if fishermen have lopped off the fins.\n\n\"It's a whole food web: If one species is declining, others will get affected, too,\" Qin said, cradling a recently deceased hammerhead. \"That's why we need to preserve every species of fish.\"\n\nNear the fence surrounding the Sunlight Seafood shrimp farm, villagers Bondien and Samayong moored their flotilla under some mangrove trees and cast lead-weighted hooks. Samayong's daughter Ida remembered her grandfather regaling her with tales of the monster fish of his youth \u2014 notably, a ray he once caught that was bigger than his boat. But that day, nothing came to nibble.\n\n\"You used to be able to catch a fish here in 10 minutes,\" said Bondien, his line slack in the water. \"Now, even if you have good bait, you can wait an hour and get only one \u2014 maybe nothing.\"\n\nAround a bend in the river, an empty bag of Royal Dragon feed had become snagged in some mangrove branches. It was emblazoned with an image of a shrimp."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Veterans Find Meditation Helps Ease Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/veterans-find-meditation-helps-ease-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/4661174.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Meditation worked as well as traditional therapy for military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder in a small experiment sponsored by the Department of Defense.\n\nOne method preferred by the Department of Veterans Affairs is exposure therapy, but it doesn\u2019t work for everyone and many can\u2019t handle what it requires: purposely recalling traumatic events and confronting emotions.\n\nMeditation could be a better choice for some, the researchers said.\n\nExposure therapy unpopular\n\nThe experiment tested meditation against exposure therapy, which involves working with a therapist and gradually letting go of fears triggered by painful memories.\n\nMany vets won\u2019t try exposure therapy or drop out because it\u2019s too difficult, said Thomas Rutledge, the study\u2019s senior author and a Veterans Affairs psychologist in San Diego.\n\nEvidence for meditation \u201callows us to put more options on the table\u201d with confidence they work, Rutledge said.\n\nThe study was published Thursday in the journal Lancet Psychiatry.\n\nFollow-up study needed\n\nAbout 400,000 veterans had a PTSD diagnosis in 2013, according to the VA health system. The VA already is using meditation, yoga and similar approaches to supplement traditional therapy with PTSD, said Paula Schnurr, executive director of the VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD.\n\nWhile the three-month study adds to evidence supporting these lifestyle practices, Schnurr said, more research is needed to learn how long meditation\u2019s benefits last.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no follow-up in this study,\u201d Schnurr noted, and one therapist did 80 percent of the exposure therapy so the findings hinge largely on one therapist\u2019s skills.\n\nResearchers measured symptoms in about 200 San Diego area veterans randomly assigned to one of three groups. Some learned to meditate. Others got exposure therapy. The third group attended classes where they learned about nutrition and exercise.\n\nAll sessions were once a week for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter three months, 61 percent of the meditation group improved on a standard PTSD assessment, compared to 42 percent of those who got exposure therapy and 32 percent of those who went to classes. When researchers accounted for other factors, meditation was better than the classes and equally effective as exposure therapy.\n\nThe researchers defined success as at least a 10-point improvement in scores on a standard symptoms test, given to participants by people who did not know which kind of treatment they\u2019d received. The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it\u2019s not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nMore interest, styles\n\nThere\u2019s growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably less threatening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in something like meditation.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Report: Russia Has Access to UK Visa Processing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/report-russia-access-uk-visa-processing/4661884.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Investigative group Bellingcat and Russian website The Insider are suggesting that Russian intelligence has infiltrated the computer infrastructure of a company that processes British visa applications.\n\nThe investigation, published Friday, aims to show how two suspected Russian military intelligence agents, who have been charged with poisoning a former Russian spy in the English city of Salisbury, may have obtained British visas.\n\nThe Insider and Bellingcat said they interviewed the former chief technical officer of a company that processes visa applications for several consulates in Moscow, including that of Britain.\n\nThe man, who fled Russia last year and applied for asylum in the United States, said he had been coerced to work with agents of the main Russian intelligence agency FSB, who revealed to him that they had access to the British visa center's CCTV cameras and had a diagram of the center's computer network.

Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nReuters Former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, left, and former Khmer Rouge leader \"Brother Number Two\" Nuon Chea were found guilty of genocide on Friday.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution. Nuon Chea was considered the main ideologist of the Khmer Rouge and the right-hand man of the group\u2019s late leader, Pol Pot, while Khieu Samphan served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Scholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nMembers of the Cham community were among the large crowd of spectators who attended Friday\u2019s session.\n\nThe court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for insuffient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u201cauto-genocide\u201d through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nOne of the spectators at Friday\u2019s hearing was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed by the Khmer Rouge, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\u201cToday, I am very happy that the both Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\u201d\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van to the courthouse from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nNuon Chea, who suffers heart problems, was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nIn addition to the two, the tribunal in 2010 convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunal\u2019s accomplishments."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "British Prime Minister Hangs By A Thread As Top Leaders Quit Over Brexit Deal", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/british-prime-minister-teresa-may-ministers-quit-brexit_us_5bed9d62e4b03af89267ca22", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "The British prime minister was clinging to power by the thinnest of threads on Thursday after a wave of resignations from her Cabinet and the beginnings of a political coup to oust her as leader.\n\nTheresa May presented her draft deal for the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union on Wednesday evening in a mammoth five-hour meeting with her top ministers.

He was not only a successful film writer but a top script doctor, the industry title for an uncredited writer brought in to improve or \u201cpunch up\u201d weak screenplays.\n\nGoldman also made political history by coining the phrase \u201cfollow the money\u201d in his script for \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal. The film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence. His advice, \u201cFollow the money,\u201d became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed. In his 1985 book, \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d he expressed disdain for an industry that elaborately produced and tested a movie, only to see it dismissed by the public during its first weekend in theaters.\n\n\u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he remarked.\n\nScreenwriter and filmmaker Aaron Sorkin called Goldman a mentor.\n\n\u201cHe was the dean of American screenwriters and generations of filmmakers will continue to walk in the footprints he laid,\u201d Sorkin said in a statement. \u201cHe wrote so many unforgettable movies, so many thunderous novels and works of non-fiction, and while I\u2019ll always wish he\u2019d written one more, I\u2019ll always be grateful for what he\u2019s left us.\u201d\n\nGoldman launched his writing career after receiving a master\u2019s degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a Ph.D., choosing instead to write the novel \u201cThe Temple of Gold\u201d in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\u201cIf the book had not been taken,\u201d he told an interviewer, \u201cI would have gone into advertising ... or something.\u201d\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including \u201cSoldier in the Rain,\u201d which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway.\n\nJames Goldman would later write the historical play \u201cThe Lion in Winter,\u201d which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, \u201cNo Way to Treat a Lady,\u201d and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screen writing. Robertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller. After that he adapted his novel \u201cHarper\u201d for a 1966 film starring Paul Newman as a private eye.\n\nHe broke through in 1969 with the blockbuster \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d starring Newman and Redford. Based on the exploits of the real-life \u201cHole in the Wall\u201d gang of bank robbers, the movie began a long association with Redford, who also appeared in \u201cThe Hot Rock,\u201d \u2033The Great Waldo Pepper\u201d and \u201cIndecent Proposal.\u201d\n\nOther notable Goldman films included \u201cThe Stepford Wives,\u201d \u2033A Bridge Too Far\u201d and \u201cMisery.\u201d The latter, adapted from a Stephen King suspense novel, won the 1990 Oscar for Kathy Bates as lead actress.\n\nIn 1961 Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, and they had two daughters, Jenny and Susanna. The couple divorced in 1991.\n\nBorn in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, Goldman grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1952 and served two years in the Army.\n\nDespite all his success as a screenwriter, Goldman always considered himself a novelist and didn\u2019t rate his scripts as great artistic achievements.\n\n\u201cA screenplay is a piece of carpentry,\u201d he once said. \u201cAnd except in the case of Ingmar Bergman, it\u2019s not an art, it\u2019s a craft.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Snow Chaos Strikes New York", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snow-chaos-strikes-new-york_us_5beee09ae4b0ac698e83cc06", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Cindy McCain Hopes Trump Learns From The Midterms", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cindy-mccain-donald-trump_us_5beeb9efe4b0c19de3fef769", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Cindy McCain, in her first interview since the death of her husband Sen.

Its broader lawsuit concerns whether the White House\u2019s decision to revoke his press pass was unconstitutional.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year, said CNN\u2019s attorneys were likely to prevail in their argument that the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s and the network\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nKelly said he did not decide whether the White House violated the First Amendment, relying primarily on the Fifth Amendment in saying that Acosta\u2019s and CNN\u2019s right to due process was likely violated because the White House process for revoking his press pass was \u201cshrouded in mystery.\u201d\n\nThe judge also cited the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Acosta. The White House had argued that CNN could simply send other reporters in Acosta\u2019s place, yet Kelly argued that it \u201cdoes not make the harm to Mr. Acosta any less real.\u201d\n\nUnder the ruling, Acosta will temporarily receive his press pass back, while the full lawsuit proceeds.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the White House \u201cwill temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass.\u201d\n\nBut in a statement, she also appeared to view the temporary ruling as a victory: \u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.\u201d\n\nSanders added that \u201cwe will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\u201d\n\nTrump also told reporters at the White House: \u201cWe want total freedom of the press. It\u2019s more important to me than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect when you\u2019re at the White House.\u201d\n\nCNN on Tuesday sued the Trump administration for confiscating Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d which grants White House press pool reporters access to the White House, following a spat between the president and Acosta during a post-midterm elections press conference last week.\n\nIn a hearing in federal court on Wednesday, Justice Department attorney James Burnham said the president has the authority to ban reporters from the White House, The Washington Post reported.\n\nBurnham also argued that Acosta can continue reporting on the Trump administration from outside the White House and noted that CNN has other reporters with White House credentials.\n\nShannon Finney via Getty Images A judge ruled in favor of CNN and reporter Jim Acosta.\n\nIn response, CNN attorney Ted Boutrous said the government had a \u201cwarped view\u201d of the First and Fifth amendments.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s now taking the position that [the president] can do anything he wants,\u201d Boutrous said, according to the Post.\n\nAfter Acosta challenged Trump with questions on his anti-immigration rhetoric and the federal Russia investigation last week, Trump demanded Acosta sit down and called him a \u201cterrible person\u201d and \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nDuring the exchange, Acosta also moved away when a female intern tried to take away the microphone he was using. The White House suspended Acosta\u2019s credentials hours after the press conference, citing his behavior toward Trump and the intern.\n\nKelly on Friday seemed unpersuaded, calling the White House\u2019s initial justification \u201cof questionable accuracy\u201d and \u201clikely untrue.\u201d\n\nThe White House later shifted its story to claim that Acosta was rude to reporters.\n\nA group of prominent news organizations have expressed support for CNN\u2019s lawsuit, including CNN competitor Fox News, which frequently provides favorable news coverage of Trump.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Fox News President Jay Wallace said the network would file an amicus brief in favor of CNN\u2019s \u201clegal effort\u201d with the U.S. District Court in Washington.\n\n\u201cSecret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\u201d Wallace said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News and The Associated Press also backed CNN\u2019s lawsuit."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Stacey Abrams Prepares Push For New Vote In Georgia Governor's Race", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stacey-abrams-brian-kemp-georgia-governor-prepares-new-vote_us_5beebf8fe4b0510a1f30047d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign and legal team is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governor\u2019s race that could leave the state\u2019s Supreme Court deciding whether to force another round of voting.\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s longshot strategy relies on a statute that\u2019s never been used in such a high-stakes contest. It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that\u2019s been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance.\n\nTop Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening.\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams\u2019 campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \u201cmisconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\u201d\n\nThe legal team is \u201cconsidering all options,\u201d Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene.\n\nShe already faces a narrow path to the governor\u2019s mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results.\n\nAbrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote.\n\nLawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don\u2019t regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers.\n\n\u201cThese stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\u201d said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\u201d\n\nKemp, who served as the state\u2019s chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won\u2019t change the outcome. His campaign has called Abrams\u2019 legal maneuvers so far a \u201cdisgrace to democracy\u201d and an attempt to \u201ccount illegal votes.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win.\n\nAll of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp\u2019s unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump\u2019s nationalism.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp\u2019s 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger.\n\nAffidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn\u2019t show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted.\n\nCathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University\u2019s law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene.\n\n\u201cI would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\u201d Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome.\n\nLawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams\u2019 team doesn\u2019t have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines.\n\nCox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \u201cdoubt\u201d to the election. \u201cWould a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\u201d she said.\n\nAbrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \u201can architect of suppression.\u201d\n\nUnder Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nIf the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \u201cthe real extreme remedy.\u201d\n\nA more \u201csurgical\u201d course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough.\n\nThe judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that\u2019s unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there\u2019s no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "GOP Senator Says Voter Suppression Is A 'Great Idea'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cindy-hyde-smith-voter-suppression_us_5beea9b7e4b0c19de3fecb10", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Sen.

Forty-five percent said they supported getting the drugs in advance from a doctor for potential use down the road, 37 percent said they believed the drugs should be available over the counter and 30 percent said they supported making the pills available to women online.\n\nAnd when asked whether they\u2019d consider using any of those methods personally, nearly a quarter of the women said they\u2019d consider getting the pills in advance from a doctor or obtaining them over the counter, while 16 percent said they\u2019d be interested in buying the pills online.\n\n\u201cIf we consider that this is a representative sample of adult, reproductive-age women across the US \u2014 many of whom may not support abortion at all, may never have considered having an abortion themselves, or may never need an abortion \u2014 the proportion in favor of these models is extremely high,\u201d study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher, said in an email to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent.\u201d\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court put reproductive rights advocates on high alert about the future of Roe v. Wade, there has been a frenzy of activity around making self-induced abortion safer for women \u2014 particularly through increased access to the abortion pill.\n\nWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent. Antonia Biggs, study author\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in all 50 states in 1973, more than 1 million illegal abortions may have been performed in the United States each year \u2014 many of them deadly. American women went to Mexico to have surgical procedures, traveling alone in cars with strangers to see providers they knew nothing about. They used coat hangers and even drank bleach. The abortion pill has fundamentally changed the nature of so-called \u201cback alley\u201d abortions, but many reproductive rights advocates believe access is still far too limited.\n\nEarlier this fall, the founder of Women on Web \u2014 an organization that has long helped women outside of the United States perform their abortions at home \u2014 told The Atlantic she had been quietly shipping abortion pills to women in this country for more than six months through her new organization, Aid Access. Like Women on Web, it not only sells women the medications but also provides them with online consultations to walk them through the process.\n\nRight around that time, the Sia Legal Team \u2014 which works with women who have induced their own abortions \u2014 announced the launch of a free helpline for women who have been questioned by the police about ending their pregnancies (or who fear they might be), as well as a website with information about the legal landscape surrounding self-managed abortions. In some states, women have been prosecuted and jailed for attempting to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cBefore abortion was declared legal by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago, finding a safe abortion was really difficult,\u201d Jill Adams, SIA\u2019s strategy director, told HuffPost. \u201cBut now people who can get abortion pills have a safe option to end a pregnancy on their own. In this scenario, and in this age, the risk is legal; it\u2019s not physical. The image of the coat hanger has been supplanted by the image of handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThere is research backing the safety of largely self-managed abortions, although these studies have not necessarily examined the safety of women going it entirely alone. A 2017 investigation found, for example, that abortions are just as safe when managed remotely via telemedicine as they are when a clinician actually watches a woman take the first pill.\n\nWhat this all means for the future of self-managed abortions in the United States is uncertain.\n\nIn an email to HuffPost, the Food and Drug Administration said it \u201ctakes the allegations related to the sale of mifepristone in the U.S. through online distribution channels very seriously and is evaluating the allegations to assess potential violations of U.S. law.\u201d The FDA said it was unable to discuss potential or pending investigations, if any exist.\n\nA spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the organization does not have an official stance on Aid Access, though it has urged the FDA to remove certain restrictions on where a woman is able to access mifepristone, given the medication\u2019s track record of safety and efficacy. The group has also come out strongly against the criminalization of women who end their pregnancies.\n\nBut the new survey suggests that interest from women is there.\n\n\u201cWe really knew little about the demand for and interest in alternative models (advance provision, online access, and over-the-counter access) of medication abortion provision,\u201d said Biggs, a researcher at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at the University of California, San Francisco."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amy Schumer Reveals She's Suffering From Hyperemesis Gravidarum", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-schumer-pregnancy-hyperemesis-gravidarum_us_5bedd783e4b0b50c4899ccab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Amy Schumer\u2019s pregnancy isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nThe comedian, who recently revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child with husband Chris Fischer, told her Instagram followers on Thursday that she\u2019s suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nThe condition, which Kate Middleton also dealt with in all three of her pregnancies, is marked by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dehydration during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI am in the hospital.

Sofia was one of 414 people diagnosed with a rare polio-like syndrome. Its cause continues to elude scientists. It is the latest challenge during a time when public health spending has declined.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nThe mysterious, polio-like disease that has struck 414 people \u2014 mostly young children \u2014 across the United States since 2014 comes at a time when the public health system already is overstretched.\n\nReported in 39 states and Washington, D.C., acute flaccid myelitis, known as AFM, causes muscle weakness and in some cases paralysis in the arms or legs, terrifying parents and puzzling medical researchers.\n\nThe disease has flared while state and federal governments largely have stopped making new investments in public health. While some infectious-disease experts think the CDC has taken too long to understand the cause of the disease, no high-profile critic has directly blamed the slow action on low public health funding.\n\nStill, many public health experts argue that the lack of investment further strains a system already stretched thin as it faces multiple challenges, including sharp upticks in sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis A and C, the opioid epidemic, seasonal flu viruses and frequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nThe low spending has thrown the U.S. public health system into \u201ccrisis,\u201d according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based research organization that promotes disease and injury prevention.\n\n\u201cInsufficient funding has hampered the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local health departments to keep pace with the new and continuing threats to the health of the American people and to fully fund prevention initiatives,\u201d the group said in a report this year on public health financing.\n\nState and local health departments must frequently shift personnel from one challenge to meet a new one, like AFM this year or the Zika virus a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen something unusual like this comes up, we don\u2019t have a pot of money to address that,\u201d said Kristen Ehresmann, Minnesota\u2019s director for infectious diseases. \u201cAnd neither does the CDC. We have to put staff on that new issue. You\u2019re constantly taking people off one thing in order to address another.\u201d\n\nCDC funding, three-fourths of which makes its way to local and state health departments, and public and private partners, in the form of grants, has lagged behind inflation since 2009 and has been almost flat since 2014. Notably, the portion of the agency\u2019s budget that goes to states for controlling infectious diseases \u00adhas also remained largely unchanged over the last four years.\n\nThe picture is similar if not worse at the state and local levels. State investment in public health funding ticked upward in the past decade only to fall below 2008 funding levels in 2015. According to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, 31 states reduced their spending on public health between fiscal 2016 and 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of County and City Health Officials estimates that since 2008, local health departments have lost 55,590 jobs through layoffs or attrition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much work, it\u2019s easy to lose focus,\u201d said Laura Power, who teaches epidemiology and internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cWhere do we put our effort? There\u2019s only so much money to go around.\u201d\n\nReporting Up\n\nAFM first drew attention in 2012 when the California Department of Public Health learned that a few children were suddenly afflicted with inexplicable weakness in their arms or legs. By the end of the year, 10 cases had been detected in the state.\n\nClinicians were not familiar with the disease; it was not one of the 120 illnesses that medical providers are required to report to their local or state health departments, which then report them to a disease surveillance system housed at the CDC.\n\nThose \u201cnotifiable diseases\u201d include infectious diseases such as meningitis, Legionnaires\u2019 disease and HIV, foodborne illnesses such as E. coli and non-infectious diseases, including cancer and lead poisoning. By reporting them up the chain, state and federal officials are able to see whether outbreaks are localized or widespread.\n\nBy 2014, AFM had been detected in 34 states. The CDC announced Tuesday that the number of confirmed cases for 2018 has climbed from the 72 reported last month to 90 across 27 states. The agency said it is investigating an additional 162 cases of patients with similar symptoms.\n\nAt this point, all states require health practitioners to report suspected cases.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical evidence gathered about the disease led the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, a collection of public health epidemiologists working as technical advisers to the CDC, to issue a case definition of the new disease in 2015 to help clinicians across the country recognize it.\n\nEven without knowing the cause of AFM, the CDC distributed information to local and state health departments and to clinicians on how to identify a possible case and what to look for in MRI tests. The agency also tentatively suggested ways to treat infected patients \u2014 mainly by quickly starting physical and rehabilitative therapy. The CDC said that about half of patients with AFM have recovered.\n\nThe agency also issued instructions on the type of specimens it needs to help understand the cause of the disease.\n\nThe CDC has research laboratories to investigate new diseases, as does the National Institutes of Health and academic medical systems, often operating under federal grants.\n\nTo nail down a cause for AFM, officials are looking to researchers at institutions such as the University of Tennessee Medical Center, the University of Colorado and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nParents and clinicians have criticized the CDC for the time it\u2019s taken to respond to the disease. Even some of the CDC\u2019s own medical advisers have complained. \u201cFrustrated and disappointed \u2014 I think that\u2019s exactly how most of us feel,\u201d Keith Van Haren, a neurologist at Stanford University Medical Center and a CDC medical adviser told CNN earlier this month.\n\n\u2018Nothing Makes You Feel Good\u2019\n\nSome parents have also bitterly complained that the CDC hasn\u2019t reported the deaths of some children from AFM. Nancy Messonnier, director of the agency\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a conference call with reporters Tuesday said the CDC could not specify the number of deaths linked to AFM because of a lack of follow-up investigation that it is now trying to correct.\n\nThe CDC said one person confirmed to have had AFM in 2017 died, although a spokeswoman, Kate Fowlie, said in an email, \u201cit is unclear what role AFM played in the death.\u201d She said no deaths among AFM patients have been reported to the agency this year.\n\nSince it appeared six years ago, AFM has spiked every other year, in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Many patients tested positive for an enterovirus known as D68, which was previously associated with respiratory symptoms but not weakness in the arms and legs. The link has led to a supposition that the virus may have mutated.\n\nBut the enterovirus hasn\u2019t been present in all those with AFM, prompting some scientists to investigate whether environmental or genetic factors might be playing a role. Messonnier said the CDC is now also exploring the possibility that the symptoms may be caused by an aberrant immune response to an infection rather than the infection itself.\n\nSome researchers also think that another virus might be a contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible and maybe likely that there may be other enteroviruses that are causing similar symptoms,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBy the time the symptoms appear, those infected might already have rid their bodies of the virus. Or, as Messonnier said, a pathogen may be hiding undetected in the body.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough disease,\u201d Osterholm said, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t fit a model of strict cause and effect.\u201d\n\nOsterholm isn\u2019t convinced that a retreat in public health funding has hampered progress in the case of AFM. Public health departments at all levels, he said, are used to dropping everything to meet new public health menaces when they must.\n\n\u201cPublic health just takes on more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of dropping major efforts.\u201d He added, however, that \u201csuch a system can\u2019t go on forever.\u201d\n\nJohn Auerbach, president and CEO of the Trust for America\u2019s Health, thinks insufficient funding is already consequential. While he pointed out that Congress eventually came up with additional funding to deal with outbreaks of Ebola and Zika in recent years, the money was not ongoing.\n\nWhen the money runs out, he said, experts in diseases such as Ebola and Zika, including epidemiologists and laboratory staff, often are laid off, removing the very people who could best prevent future outbreaks.\n\n\u201cWe know when permanent personnel are well trained in preparedness, they are able to anticipate a risk and take action before a crisis occurs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there aren\u2019t enough personnel, then you end up only being able to respond to an emergency, rather than prevent its appearance or reduce its impact.\u201d\n\nAs it is, he said, many health agencies can\u2019t do an adequate job to increase the rate of vaccinations or to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, both of which would contribute greatly to reducing diseases, such as Zika and perhaps AFM, in the country, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery health department would say, \u2018Yes, we could do more, but only if we had the resources,\u2019\u201d Auerbach said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "It's Still Not That Easy To Buy Naloxone At Pharmacies", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naloxone-narcan-pharmacy-research_us_5bec7165e4b0a2569fd1320c", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "STAT News In states where selling the overdose reversal drug naloxone is permitted, many pharmacists told researchers posing as customers that the drug wasn't available by prescription, or that their store didn't stock it.\n\nDespite laws in the majority of states allowing pharmacies to dispense the opioid overdose reversal antidote naloxone without a prescription, as well as Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams\u2019 national advisory in April, recommending that more Americans learn how to use naloxone and carry it with them, new research indicates that it\u2019s still not simple to buy the drug at pharmacies.\n\nNaloxone has been available in California without a prescription since 2016, but when researchers called 1,147 pharmacies to ask for it, less than a quarter of the pharmacies said they would provide the drug without a prescription. Of the pharmacies that said they would dispense naloxone, only half had it in stock, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in November.\n\nChain pharmacies were significantly more likely to offer naloxone than independent pharmacies.\n\nA different survey published in JAMA was conducted in Texas, where naloxone is available at pharmacies that have standing orders from prescribers to dispense it. Researchers surveyed 2,317 chain pharmacies with those standing orders and found that 84 percent said they would sell the drug without a prescription. Of those pharmacies, 69 percent said they had naloxone in stock.\n\nResearchers in both studies cited lack of knowledge about the laws surrounding naloxone prescription, insufficient training for pharmacists and stigma as possible reasons that pharmacies aren\u2019t dispensing the life-saving drugs, even though they\u2019re legally allowed to do so.\n\nWe need to continue our efforts to educate and support pharmacists. Talia Puzantian, lead author of the California research\n\nFor example, at least 40 pharmacists in Texas thought that they could only dispense naloxone without a prescription if a patient was actively overdosing, which Kirk Evoy, lead author of the Texas research and a clinical assistant professor the University of Texas at Austin called \u201can especially alarming finding.\u201d If someone overdoses and there\u2019s no naloxone on hand, the correct response is to call 911, not travel to a pharmacy.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue our efforts to educate and support pharmacists,\u201d said Talia Puzantian, lead author of the California research and an associate professor of clinical sciences at Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.\n\nIn California, some pharmacists weren\u2019t stocking naloxone because few customers were requesting it and not many doctors were prescribing it, leading to a circular pattern of deprioritizing the drug.\n\nPuzantian pointed to the pharmacists\u2019 successful public health efforts to immunize their communities against the flu as a good model, and noted that because of their access to patient information about overdose risk, pharmacists were \u201cwell poised\u201d to help fight the opioid epidemic.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has called for a two-day advisory committee meeting to improve Americans\u2019 access to naloxone in December.\n\nIn the meantime, 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, with nearly 50,000 of those deaths attributable to opioids, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNaloxone in pharmacies remains unreliable even in areas in which there\u2019s been a concerted effort to expand access.\n\nIn New York City, where 1,374 people died of drug overdoses in 2016, the health department\u2019s \u201cI Saved A Life\u201d naloxone awareness campaign directed New Yorkers to more than 700 pharmacies in the city that dispense naloxone without a prescription.\n\nA New York Times examination into that list, however, found that that less than a third of those pharmacies had naloxone on hand and would distribute it without a prescription. The Times, which placed calls to all 720 pharmacies on the list in March, reported that there was widespread confusion among pharmacists about insurance and prescribing protocols.\n\nEvoy said he viewed Texas\u2019 comparatively better results both as a sign of positive steps are being taken to improve naloxone access, and also as a call to action for community pharmacies to better educate and support their staffs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "FDA Moves To Ban Menthol Cigarettes And Flavored Cigars, Restrict Vaping", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fda-ban-menthol-cigarettes-flavored-cigars-vaping_us_5bed8ff4e4b0dbb7ea684a66", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "The Food and Drug Administration announced plans Thursday to greatly restrict the sales of flavored tobacco products, proposing to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars entirely and to limit the sales of flavored e-cigarettes by certain retailers.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, retailers selling flavored e-cigarettes would have to display them in a section of the store that\u2019s off-limits to anyone under the age of 18.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Killing Khashoggi: How a Brutal Saudi Hit Job Unfolded", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006154117/khashoggi-istanbul-death-saudi-consulate.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The President Be Impeached?\u2019 We Answer Your Questions"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Julian Assange Is Secretly Charged in U.S., Prosecutors Mistakenly Reveal", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/julian-assange-indictment-wikileaks.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at George Washington University who closely tracks court cases, uncovered the filing and posted it on Twitter.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to say on Thursday what led to the inadvertent disclosure. It was made in a recently unsealed filing in an apparently unrelated sex-crimes case charging a man named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi with coercing and enticing an underage person to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Mr. Kokayi was charged in early August, and on Aug. 22, prosecutors filed a three-page document laying out boilerplate arguments for why his case at that time needed to remain sealed.\n\nWhile the filing started out referencing Mr. Kokayi, federal prosecutors abruptly switched on its second page to discussing the fact that someone named \u201cAssange\u201d had been secretly charged, and went on to make clear that this person was the subject of significant publicity, lived abroad and would need to be extradited \u2014 suggesting that prosecutors had inadvertently pasted text from a similar court filing into the wrong document and then filed it.\n\n\u201cAnother procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nThey added, \u201cThe complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has been studying how to charge Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks with some kind of criminal offense since the site began publishing its trove of secret military and diplomatic documents. Prosecutors, for example, toyed with the idea of charging Mr. Assange as a conspirator in Ms. Manning\u2019s crime of unauthorized disclosure of secrets related to national defense. And it eventually became public that a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia was investigating people with links to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut even as the Obama administration brought criminal charges in an unprecedented number of leak-related cases, it apparently held back from charging Mr. Assange.

A curtain won\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nIndustry lawyers challenged the commissioner\u2019s authority to impose such requirements. \u201cThe Tobacco Control Act is clear that the F.D.A. can\u2019t discriminate against one type of retail outlet and that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do here,\u201d said Doug Kantor, counsel to the National Association of Convenience Stores. \u201cThere is a very good chance this will end up in litigation and lawyers are looking at that right now.\u201d\n\nCritics said that exempting menthol and mint e-cigarettes from the restriction was misguided, because of the large number of youth vapers who buy them.\n\nBut Mr. Chowdhury considered Juul\u2019s pre-emptive move to limit visible flavors to mint, menthol and tobacco shrewd. If indeed a ban on menthol cigarettes is enacted, he said, \u201cJuul is in a good position to offer an alternative product for smokers who are used to their menthol flavor. Because Juul has market dominance, they stand to benefit from an ultimate ban.\u201d\n\nBut a prohibition against menthol cigarettes would have to clear the usual federal regulatory hurdles, a process that could take at least two years. If successful, the menthol ban could make a significant dent in cigarette sales. Menthol cigarettes account for about 35 percent of cigarette sales in the United States.\n\n[Answers to common questions about the health effects of e-cigarettes and teenage vaping]\n\nMurray Garnick, the general counsel for Altria Group, which sells vaping products like MarkTen Elite and Apex through its Nu Mark subsidiary, said in an email that the tobacco giant welcomed the F.D.A.\u2019s new e-cigarette policies.\n\nBut, he predicted a lengthy debate over the proposed prohibition on menthol cigarettes: \u201cWe continue to believe that a total ban on menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars would be an extreme measure not supported by the science and evidence.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Q&A: The ABCs of E-Cigarettes", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/health/qna-ecigarettes-teenagers.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "The term \u201celectronic cigarette\u201d refers to a battery-powered device that heats a tank or cartridge of liquid usually containing nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals, but not the cancer-causing tar found in tobacco cigarettes. Users inhale and exhale the vapor. The devices come in numerous shapes, including ones that look like pens, flash drives and hookahs. Many consumers are confused about the health implications of e-cigarettes. This is a primer about what research so far shows about these devices.\n\nAre they safer than traditional cigarettes?\n\nYes. But that does not mean they are safe.\n\nE-cigarettes contain far fewer dangerous chemicals than those released in burning tobacco. Tobacco cigarettes typically contain 7,000 chemicals, including nearly 70 known to be carcinogenic. E-cigarettes also don\u2019t release tar, the tobacco residue that damages lungs but also contributes to the flavor of tobacco products. In the United States, cigarettes are associated with 480,000 deaths a year from coronary heart disease, stroke and numerous cancers, among other illnesses.\n\nThe research on e-cigarettes is young because the products have only been around for a little over a decade. Exacerbated by the voltage of a given device, certain e-cigarette flavors can irritate the airways, researchers say: benzaldehyde (added to cherry flavored liquids), cinnamaldehyde (gives cinnamon flavor), and diacetyl (a buttery flavor that can cause lung tissue damage called \u201cpopcorn lung.\u201d) Some flavors become irritants when added to vaping liquids. The process of turning liquid chemicals into vapor releases harmful particulates deep into the lungs and atmosphere, including heavy metals."}]
