The frigate, which was returning from NATO's Trident Juncture exercises, was evacuated after the collision with the Sola TS tanker, Norway's army said.\n\nNorway's military has remained tight lipped about the situation, which injured eight of the 137 people on board. Navy communications officer Torill Herland told CNN that whatever occurred during the accident near Bergen is now \"police work.\"\n\nA joint Norwegian and Maltese investigation is now also underway to try and determine the cause.\n\nSimilar cases involving US Navy destroyers over the last two years were found to have been down to avoidable errors, according to Alex Pape, Editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, but he said it is too early to speculate on this incident.\n\n\"Warships, particularly surface combatants like frigates, are generally designed to withstand a degree of battle damage,\" Pape told CNN.\n\n\"However, even for well protected warships, if they sustain sufficient damage, particularly in adjacent compartments and below the waterline, the resulting flooding may be too much for pumps and/or the crew's damage control efforts to cope with, and the ship will list, capsize or sink.\n\nPape said this particular incident suggests that in addition to a visible large hole torn in the starboard side, there is substantial damage to the hull near or below the waterline, which then rapidly flooded the aft compartments of the ship.\n\nHeavy chains\n\nThe attempted rescue of the frigate has certainly raised eyebrows.\n\nJan Vindenes is the general manager of Sotra Anchor & Chain, whose products have been used in numerous shipwreck recoveries, including that of the Costa Concordia -- the cruise ship which crashed into rocks off the coast of Italy in 2012, killing 32 people on board. He thinks chains could have been used to secure the frigate.\n\n\"They used some wire to secure the frigate but unfortunately it snapped. We say that chain is stronger and better than wire.\"\n\nNye bilder og videoer av KNM Helge Ingstad som har sunket dypere i sj\u00f8en - p\u00e5 https://t.co/WjQchCUqZV : https://t.co/xIjQq7Yezv pic.twitter.com/dECfO75Ego \u2014 Kystverket (@Kystverket) November 13, 2018\n\n\"We have chain that can hold 2,000 tonnes, and our chain was used to raise the Costa Concordia, which was very much bigger than this frigate\" he added.\n\nA costly crash\n\nGiven that the frigate is one of only five operated by the Norwegian navy, its loss is likely to impact on national and NATO operations. But the country's military will have to carefully consider the cost of salvaging and repairing it for active service.\n\nPape told CNN: \"Curiously, if the ship is not repaired, the reduction of one ship that needs to be maintained, upgraded, manned and used over the remaining 20 years of its life will mean that cost for the navy could go down in the long run, however with a loss of capability.\"\n\nPape estimates that a decision to salvage it, repair it, and return it to service would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \"The total cost could be similar to the cost of a new ship.\"\n\nThe financial impact of the crash is likely to be felt well beyond the military, as it triggered the shutdown of a North Sea crude export terminal, Norway's largest gas processing plant and several offshore fields.\n\nIn total, these five oil and gas fields produce around 400 million Norwegian krone ($48 million) a day or 17 million krone ($2 million) an hour. Since the oil companies pay 78 percent taxes to the state for production, the two-day shutdown ultimately resulted in a substantial economic loss for the nation, national broadcaster NRK reported.\n\nFortunately the oil tanker -- which was carrying almost 100 million liters of oil -- was not seriously damaged in the accident. The Norwegian Coastal Administration said it had cleaned up some diesel and helicopter fuel that was spilled in the incident, but that has been largely contained, according to Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway.\n\n\"A major leakage would have constituted an unbelievable environmental disaster that easily could have impacted most of Norway's western coastline,\" Gulowsen told CNN.\n\nThe crash led to a small amount of diesel and 10,000 liters of helicopter fuel to leak from the vessel, which has largely been contained and recovered, he said.\n\nGulowsen added however that, \"the situation is not yet stable and the vessel is still under water. The frigate had additional 385,000 liters of marine diesel, but this has not leaked,\"\n\nThe Norwegian Navy is now considering ways to raise the vessel, according to the military's chief of staff, Admiral Nils Andreas Stensones.\n\n\"It's very hard for a navy to lose a vessel,\" he told AFP."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "This is the world's oldest intact shipwreck", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/1jjmJhtHYAQ/world-oldest-shipwreck-orig-st.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "A wreck discovered on the Black Sea floor in 2017 is over 2,400 years old.

But May is going to face down her most vocal critics in the most public, damning way imaginable.\n\nBriefly, back to the deal. The sticking point -- what happens on the island of Ireland -- seems to come down to essentially one question: is it more important for the UK to have an independent trading policy or to have a hard border between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which will remain a part of the UK? Everything else -- laws, borders, even money -- hangs on this question being answered.\n\nFor the record, it's worth pointing out that a hard border is something the EU and the Republic of Ireland absolutely will not tolerate.\n\nAnd it's pretty clear now that having both is not possible.\n\nMay's deal with the EU, her supporters would tell you, gets as close to both options as is ever going to be possible. Still, it's not enough for large sections of the UK parliament, who will have a say on the deal when May has it signed off in Brussels.\n\nJUST WATCHED British PM Theresa May strikes Brexit deal with cabinet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH British PM Theresa May strikes Brexit deal with cabinet 01:25\n\nFrom Scottish nationalists to Northern Irish unionists to countryside Brexiteers, this is a deal that doesn't address their foremost concerns. These concerns vary from shaking the shackles of EU law and regulation to maintaining access to the EU's single market. Some even want to chuck the whole thing and rejoin the EU.\n\nSo why on earth would the Prime Minister take the vote to the Commons knowing there's a real chance she could lose? Why is she not changing course and going back to Brussels to try for more concessions?\n\nMay has a habit of hanging on and proving us all wrong. Ever since she lost her majority in Parliament in last year's election, her leadership has been in constant question. But on she goes.\n\nIt could be brinksmanship. It could be confidence. It could even be a direct challenge to her own party: back me or push me.\n\nAll day, we have heard rumors of her MPs submitting letters of no confidence in her leadership, a process that could lead to a vote that could dislodge her as Prime Minister.\n\nOr not. There is still the very real possibility that she could win such a vote and strengthen her position among her own MPs. But even at that point, the arithmetic of Parliament would remain something of a mystery.\n\nAnd it's a mystery that needs solving very soon. Businesses, investors, employers and diplomatic allies want clarity.\n\nAnd until that mystery is solved, the real costs will stack up. The pound will continue to be volatile, jobs will continue to be put at risk and economists will continue to tear their hair out.\n\nBut this isn't about economics; it's about the mayhem in a country whose politics have barely functioned in 2018."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Easter Islanders to visit London in bid to get statue back", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/jq2qbSKGlIU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Written by Jack Guy, CNN\n\nA delegation from Easter Island is preparing to visit London to ask for the return of a huge statue from the British Museum.\n\nThe 2.5-meter basalt figure has been part of the museum's collection since 1869 -- but now the islanders want it back.\n\nEaster Island, known as Rapa Nui in the local language and governed by Chile, is famous for the moai statues that dot its landscape.\n\nA delegation including Carlos Edmunds, president of the council of Rapa Nui elders, and Felipe Ward, Chile's minister for national property, will travel to London to underline the significance of the moai and discuss its future.

The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered, though, people can \"reduce their PM exposure by about 90%\" by being inside, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you have to go outside, Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator, a specially designed mask that provides \"very efficient filtration of airborne particles\" when worn correctly, according to the Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe agency warns that \"a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair,\" which means the masks \"may not provide full protection\" for those people.\n\nBut even if you are able to protect your lungs, Jaffe said, diminished air quality can be demoralizing. \"There's a mental health issue too,\" he said. \"Everybody is unhappy, and it's hard to enjoy life.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Fire destroyed his home but left the engagement ring he plans to propose with", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/FRBmiIKlOr0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Nick Maes lost the Paradise home where he grew up in the Camp Fire that's ravaging Northern California.\n\n\"The first thing (I thought of) was the tragedy of losing it, and all the history and memories that were in there,\" Maes told CNN affiliate KCRA\n\nThen, he remembered the ring -- the diamond ring he was planning to propose with soon.\n\nBack when he bought it, Maes stored the ring in a safe inside his parents' bedroom.

He said the situation was \"extraordinarily chaotic and rapidly moving\" and so it took time for fire experts to get to the scene, determine the fire's direction and warn the affected people -- time they just didn't have.\n\n\"There were notifications sent out, but as I said over and over again, this fire was moving so rapidly we couldn't keep ahead of it,\" Honea said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said landline phones are automatically enrolled in the county's alert system, but cell phones have to be opted in to get the alerts. She said they have conducted drives to get people to register, but she wasn't sure how many residents signed up.\n\n\"I got a phone call, I got texts on my cell phone.

Hide Caption 95 of 95\n\nThe questions over the use of the emergency alert system come as firefighters continue to battle the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nThe fire's rapid spread through the town of Paradise and beyond left at least 56 people dead and destroyed thousands of homes and structures, making it the most destructive and deadliest blaze in state history.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Butte County sheriff published a list of more than a hundred people unaccounted for and still missing from the Camp Fire. The blaze, which has burned 140,000 acres, remains just 40% contained.\n\nHonea said that, for now, Butte County would continue to focus on assisting CalFire on fighting the Camp Fire. Once the fire is contained, they will go back and look closer into the emergency alert system, he said.\n\n\"We're getting a lot of requests and calls from people who want us to spend a lot of time going back and collecting data and there will be a time for that, but right now I need to focus on the fight in front of us,\" Honea said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape 02:15\n\nAs Honea noted, the speed of the fire took everyone by surprise and left residents of Paradise scrambling to escape in car and on foot.\n\nThe Camp Fire charred 20,000 acres last Thursday in less than 14 hours . Its most significant growth period was early Thursday afternoon, when it grew 10,000 acres in about 90 minutes -- burning the equivalent of more than one football field every second during that time.\n\n\"We did our absolute best in terms of Amber-style alert, we used emergency mass notification system as well as our efforts to notify people when we're in the communities. We employed that,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea offered several other explanations for why the alerts did not reach people in harm's way.\n\nHe said the fire took place in a remote area where cell phone service may not be great. He also said that some people who received the warning may not have acted immediately to get out, and suggested that people may have been lulled into a false sense of security regarding fires.\n\n\"I don't think it would be appropriate to draw the conclusion that because (bodies) were found in their house, you can automatically assume they were not notified,\" he said. \"It is possible that they were notified but they chose not to heed the warning and we have heard of stories like that.\"\n\n'For the most part, our plan worked'\n\nMayor Jones said that the fire simply moved too quickly, especially compared to 2008's devastating fire season.\n\n\"I mean, it just happened so fast. There wasn't time to give anybody longer. In 2008, we had three hours between the first notice and the mandatory evacuation. We had three hours to pack up stuff,\" she said.\n\nThis time, though? \"We had no time at all. Maybe five minutes,\" she added.\n\nAbout 26,000 people live in Paradise, some 85 miles north of Sacramento. Jones estimated that about 80 to 90% of the town was destroyed.\n\nStill, despite the issue with the alert system, she defended the evacuation plan, calling it \"organized chaos.\"\n\n\"It did take time to get everybody through just because so many people were evacuated at the same time,\" she said. \"But I think for the most part, our plan worked. If we hadn't had that plan, it would have been awful.\"\n\nLast October, officials in Northern California faced similar criticism from residents who said they learned of the fire by the smell of smoke or noise from their pets rather than from an emergency alert.\n\nAt the time, Kelly Huston, then the deputy director for California's Office of Emergency Service, said alerts and warnings happen on a local level, not a state level.\n\n\"They decide what are the appropriate alerts for their population,\" Houston said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "President Trump visits California wildfire zones", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Ys9azfC3n8I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "California Gov.

The Saudi government has denied bin Salman's involvement in Khashoggi's death.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the United States would hold all involved with Khashoggi's murder to account. He also said he wanted to preserve the strong relationship with Saudi Arabia amid the murder investigation.\n\n\"The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder,\" Pence said early Saturday morning while in Papua New Guinea on a foreign trip.\n\nKhashoggi, a former Saudi royal insider who became a critic of the country's government, went missing in October after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain papers for his upcoming marriage. The Saudi government offered changing explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance.\n\nIncluded in the US intelligence analyzed by the CIA was a phone call the prince's brother Khalid bin Salman made to Khashoggi, encouraging the journalist to make the trip to the consulate to get the documents, according to the Post. Sources told the Post that Khalid made the call at his brother's command.\n\nKhalid denied the Post's reporting, saying on Twitter that he had never spoken to Khashoggi by phone.\n\n\"I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the US government to release any information regarding this claim,\" Khalid said.\n\nHe said the last contact he'd had with Khashoggi was via text in October 2017.\n\nFatimah Baeshen, a spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, told the Post that Khalid, who is the Saudi ambassador to the US, and Khashoggi never discussed \"anything related to going to Turkey.\"\n\nThe CIA also examined an audio recording from inside the Saudi consulate provided by Turkey and a phone call placed from inside the consulate after Khashoggi was killed, according to the Post.\n\nMaher Mutreb, an alleged member of the Saudi hit team and a security official for the crown prince, placed the phone call to a top aide for bin Salman informing the aide that the job had been done, people familiar with the call told the newspaper.\n\nThe CIA does not know the location of Khashoggi's remains, according to the Post.\n\nThe Trump administration on Thursday imposed penalties on 17 individuals over their alleged roles in the killing of Khashoggi. Khashoggi's assassination has created a crisis for the Trump administration and drawn attention to President Donald Trump's business ties to Saudi Arabia and the relationship between bin Salman and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Saudi Public Prosecutor's Office said 11 people had been charged for their involvement in the death of Khashoggi, adding that five are facing capital punishment for being directly involved in \"ordering and executing the crime.\"\n\nKhashoggi was killed following \"a fight and a quarrel\" at the Saudi consulate, the prosecutor's office claimed. Prosecutors said Khashoggi was tied up and injected with an overdose of a sedative that killed him.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening, which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind, but it's also colder, which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.\n\nThe bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes, but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway, organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCrashes can, of course, occur at very high speeds, but injuries are typically not serious, usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line, when the bike \"exploded,\" Krause said, but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.\n\nAs Mario Andretti, one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions, put it: \"If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Due to wildfires, California now has the most polluted cities in the world", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/5usvmUpsfnQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Due to the wildfires raging in Northern California, San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento were the world's three \"most polluted cities\" on Friday morning, according to Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit that aggregates data from air-quality monitoring sites.\n\nCNN meteorologist Brandon Miller confirmed that \"no region on Earth had as many air quality stations in the highest ranges\" of particulate matter, or PM, the toxic mixture of particles and droplets that worsens after wildfires.\n\nThose values, he said, \"stretched for hundreds of miles over Northern and Central California, from the mountains to the valleys and the coast.\"\n\nA ferry boat makes its way toward Alcatraz Island as the San Francisco skyline in is obscured by wildfire smoke and haze.\n\nSchools, colleges and public transit have closed as smoke from the Camp Fire descends on the region.\n\n\"It appears to be the worst air quality ever experienced in San Francisco,\" said Dan Jaffe, a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Washington. He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote. Some students, even those without pre-existing conditions, said they felt sick.\n\n\"I had a bloody throat, bloody nose, a cough, dry and watering eyes, and my throat is still very sore and dry,\" freshman Sabrina Thorn said. \"I almost passed out trying to go to class yesterday. My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered, though, people can \"reduce their PM exposure by about 90%\" by being inside, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you have to go outside, Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator, a specially designed mask that provides \"very efficient filtration of airborne particles\" when worn correctly, according to the Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe agency warns that \"a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair,\" which means the masks \"may not provide full protection\" for those people.\n\nBut even if you are able to protect your lungs, Jaffe said, diminished air quality can be demoralizing. \"There's a mental health issue too,\" he said. \"Everybody is unhappy, and it's hard to enjoy life.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Deadly multistate salmonella outbreak related to raw turkey grows", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/jPNe2HyebRs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain.\n\nThe samples were from a Sept. 11, 2018 production, and, according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states.

These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDespite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors, Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\nHe also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or \"appealing to youth.\"\n\n\"This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters, or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda,\" the announcement said.\n\nConsumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\n\"We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" he said. \"This is one of our highest priorities.\"\n\n'Spike in use'\n\nOne in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month, according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I'm also a father of young kids, and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about,\" Gottlieb told CNN. \"Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools, in their middle schools.\"\n\nHealth experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"This is a large pool of future risk.\"\n\nThe new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year, and they are using flavored liquids more often, according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days, and over two-thirds had used flavored products.\n\n\"Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use, and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products, with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease.\"\n\nThe new numbers come from a school-based survey, conducted from March to May, which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year, now totaling 3.6 million kids, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe \"alarming\" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers \"earlier than usual\" in hopes of spurring immediate action, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes, we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily,\" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThe rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now, that number is 20.8%.\n\nGottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years.\n\n\"The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains,\" he told CNN. \"We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nHealth and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals, but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions, teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products \"sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance, a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop),\" the announcement said.\n\nCritics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence.\n\n\"The FDA needs to go further,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement Friday. \"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales.\"\n\nThe FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past, issuing warnings and fines to more than 1,300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids, after an undercover investigation this summer.\n\nMyers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA \"as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids, as in the case of Juul.\"\n\nInstead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.\n\nThis decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services, filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval.\n\nUnder Gottlieb's latest proposal, the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use.\n\n\"We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nHe told CNN, \"If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here, because there is more that we can do.\"\n\nMenthol\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Thursday. \"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes, saying that \"the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans.\"\n\nNearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010, representing more than 80% of black smokers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, R.J. Reynolds, which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US, denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it \"will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans\" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would \"increase the illegal market, fueling more criminal activity.\"\n\nThe company has fought previous similar efforts, contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, which voters approved in June.\n\nCiting the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth, National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA \"to move forward with urgency to implement this plan\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear,\" Morial said.\n\n'Not enough'\n\nVaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday.\n\n\"No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However, this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative,\" Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause,\" he said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids.\n\n\"We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product,\" said the association, which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.\n\nPharmacy chain CVS Health, which does not sell tobacco or vaping products, supported the move. Its chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan, said that the company applauds \"the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products, which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"The need for action is urgent,\" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. \"But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough.\n\n\"The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\" she added, \"and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids.\"\n\nOther actions\n\nThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids, beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.\n\nIt recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nThat move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.\n\nThis month, Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will \"focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth.\"\n\nGottlieb has met with companies like Juul, asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands. But some have been critical of these efforts, with one anti-tobacco advocate comparing them to \"asking the fox to recommend plans for guarding the hen house.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe leading maker of e-cigarettes, Juul, vowed on Tuesday to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.

As well as issues with mobility and comfort, the twins had recently been losing weight, which was a concern to doctors, Elizabeth Lodge, CEO of Melbourne-based nonprofit Children First Foundation, which funded the operation said last month.\n\nThe girls' operation was estimated to cost about $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), according to 9 News.\n\n'Delightful to look after'\n\nNurse coordinator Smith said Nima and Dawa have been a delight to look after, and that their personalities were shining through.\n\nMegan Collins, another nurse on the ward, agreed that the pair were in good spirits.\n\n\"They're loving interacting with the nursing staff,\" Collins said.\n\nThe operation was estimated to have cost around $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), which was raised by Children First Foundation.\n\n\"We're now blowing bubbles and doing high fives, they love it when we're watching the Wiggles -- they'll do little dance moves with their hands and what-not,\" Channel 7 reported Collins as saying during a press conference.\n\n\"It's really nice to see them separated. But they're still really happy about wanting to be close to one another.\"\n\nDifficult surgery\n\nConjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% are female, and they are always identical twins.\n\nScientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.\n\n\"The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThey were previously commonly referred to as \"Siamese twins,\" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. Never separated, they lived to the age of 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them.\n\nPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November.\n\nThe publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.\n\nSome Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.\n\nMark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK \"half in and half out\" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament.\n\nBut Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to \"stop and reflect\", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's.\n\n\"All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray.\"\n\nIf there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would \"easily\" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying \"when pen comes to paper\" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Susana Mendon\u00e7a, BBC political correspondent\n\nWhen they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as \"collective responsibility\".\n\nBut the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in.\n\nThis apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an \"embryonic\" stage but will they get their tweaks?\n\nAndrea Leadsom thinks there's \"still more to be done\" and that they \"do still have more time\" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment.\n\nOn Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something \"winnable and supportable\".\n\nThe four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: \"What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for.\n\n\"I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with.\"\n\nAmong her concerns was that \"the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement\" with the EU, she said.\n\nShe added: \"I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.\"\n\nThe cabinet \"gang of five\" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThe backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nThe UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nAccording to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue.\n\nThe group's plans were described as a \"work in progress\", and a \"last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons\".\n\nThe deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.

His body has not been found.\n\nTurkey also insists the order to kill him came from the highest levels.\n\nWhat is the CIA's finding based on?\n\nThe Washington Post, which Khashoggi worked for, says the CIA assessment was based partly on a phone call made by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the US.\n\nPrince Khalid allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen?\n\nPrince Khalid, now back in Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that he had not been in contact with Khashoggi for nearly a year.\n\nHe said he had never suggested Khashoggi - who had been in London for a conference until the day before his disappearance - should go to Turkey for any reason.\n\nIt is understood agents have also examined a call made to a senior aide of Crown Prince bin Salman by the team that carried out the killing.\n\nSources quoted in the US media stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe such an operation would have needed his approval.\n\nWhat do the Saudis say happened to Khashoggi?\n\nAt a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said Khashoggi was given a lethal injection and his body was dismembered inside the consulate after his death.\n\nThe body parts were then handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the grounds, he added.\n\nA composite sketch of the collaborator has been produced and investigations are continuing to locate the remains.\n\nEleven unidentified people have been charged over the journalist's death and the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of them.\n\nDamning case but no smoking gun\n\nBy Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe reported CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi largely matches those in other Western capitals, including London.\n\nThe purported intercepted phone call - denied by the Saudis - between MBS's brother in Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, and Khashoggi, urging him to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, would appear to be at the behest of the crown prince.\n\nA second intercepted phone call was from the hit team on the day of the murder to someone inside MBS's inner circle in Riyadh. Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the Crown Prince's knowledge\n\nTaken together with the SIGINT (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial.\n\nGovernment officials do not believe there is a metaphorical \"smoking gun\" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder.

It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November.\n\nThe publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.\n\nSome Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.\n\nMark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK \"half in and half out\" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament.\n\nBut Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to \"stop and reflect\", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's.\n\n\"All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray.\"\n\nIf there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would \"easily\" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying \"when pen comes to paper\" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Susana Mendon\u00e7a, BBC political correspondent\n\nWhen they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as \"collective responsibility\".\n\nBut the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in.\n\nThis apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an \"embryonic\" stage but will they get their tweaks?\n\nAndrea Leadsom thinks there's \"still more to be done\" and that they \"do still have more time\" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment.\n\nOn Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something \"winnable and supportable\".\n\nThe four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: \"What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for.\n\n\"I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with.\"\n\nAmong her concerns was that \"the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement\" with the EU, she said.\n\nShe added: \"I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.\"\n\nThe cabinet \"gang of five\" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThe backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nThe UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nAccording to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue.\n\nThe group's plans were described as a \"work in progress\", and a \"last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons\".\n\nThe deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.

It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November.\n\nThe publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.\n\nSome Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.\n\nMark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK \"half in and half out\" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament.\n\nBut Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to \"stop and reflect\", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's.\n\n\"All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray.\"\n\nIf there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would \"easily\" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying \"when pen comes to paper\" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Susana Mendon\u00e7a, BBC political correspondent\n\nWhen they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as \"collective responsibility\".\n\nBut the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in.\n\nThis apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an \"embryonic\" stage but will they get their tweaks?\n\nAndrea Leadsom thinks there's \"still more to be done\" and that they \"do still have more time\" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment.\n\nOn Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something \"winnable and supportable\".\n\nThe four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: \"What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for.\n\n\"I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with.\"\n\nAmong her concerns was that \"the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement\" with the EU, she said.\n\nShe added: \"I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.\"\n\nThe cabinet \"gang of five\" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThe backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nThe UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nAccording to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue.\n\nThe group's plans were described as a \"work in progress\", and a \"last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons\".\n\nThe deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to \"tweaks\" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said \"nothing fundamental\" could change.\n\nOur correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter \"some kind of bargaining process\" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year.\n\n\"I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,\" he told Sky News.\n\nWhisky for May\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was \"not everybody's ideal deal\" but said her job was to make \"tough decisions\" and \"find a way through\".\n\nShe also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.\n\nCommenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been \"a pretty heavy couple of days\".\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The PM says her husband is protective over her\n\nShe revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her \"rock\", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast.\n\nOn Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a \"social media blitz\" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics.\n\nMrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday.\n\nA No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Amber Rudd returns to the frontbench - she quit as home secretary in April over the Windrush controversy\n\nIn other developments:\n\nAmber Rudd was named as the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the deal\n\nStephen Hammond takes over from Mr Barclay as a health minister in the mini-reshuffle\n\nAnd John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara; while Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman\n\nDavid Davis, Brexit secretary before Mr Raab, pressed Mrs May for a looser deal with the EU, saying the US would be ready to start negotiating a free trade deal straight after Brexit if she ditches her plan\n\nOn Sunday, the pro-Brexit European Research Group plans to publish a seven-page summary of the 585-page draft agreement\n\nThe Chief Constable of Northern Ireland warned that \"anything that re-emphasises\" the Irish border presented challenges for policing and the threat of violence was not being exaggerated\n\nMeanwhile Ireland's deputy PM Simon Coveney warned British politicians to sign up to the deal or risk crashing out of the EU without one, saying people were \"too quick\" to write off Mrs May\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit that Mrs May agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday has been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46237012", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:43", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.\n\nChris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.\n\nTransition\n\nThe transition period (which the UK government calls \"implementation period\") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.\n\nThe UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.\n\nBoth the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMoney\n\nThe draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or \"divorce bill\") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.\n\nWhile no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least \u00a339bn and it will be paid over a number of years.\n\nPart of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net \u00a310.8bn.\n\nIf the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the \"divorce bill\" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.\n\nMoney remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.\n\nCitizens' rights\n\nThis is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.\n\nUK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.\n\nCitizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.\n\nAnyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nBritish citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.\n\nNorthern Ireland/the backstop\n\nIf no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of \"a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom\" will be triggered.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.\n\nAs long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to \"level playing field conditions\", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.\n\nThe UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.\n\nThat upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nFishing\n\nThe agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.\n\nThe document says: \"The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.\n\nIt's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.\n\nLaws and disputes\n\nThe UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.\n\nIf the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU.\n\nInstead, there will be a dispute resolution procedure which provides for arbitration. However, if the dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.\n\nThat is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.\n\nWhat else is in it?\n\nElsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.\n\nThere's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.\n\nEU-approved geographic indications, protecting approved names like \"Welsh Lamb\" or \"Parma Ham\" remain.\n\nAlongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Stephen Barclay named new Brexit Secretary", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46241693", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:00:48", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nStephen Barclay has been picked as the new Brexit secretary, as Theresa May seeks to fill her cabinet after several of her top team quit.\n\nThe MP for North East Cambridgeshire - who is a Leave supporter - had been a health minister since January.\n\nHe replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned on Thursday over Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for Brexit.\n\nA No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay would focus on the domestic preparations rather than negotiations.\n\nMr Barclay's promotion comes after a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, after two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides quit following the publication of the proposed Brexit agreement.\n\nAnd some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the deal have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May.

So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table' (acknowledge the issue, rather than leaving it), so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been observed under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and savannah had been converted to land for crops over the past few decades and therefore wildfires had decreased.\n\nThe research, however, found that the drop was not huge though.\n\nIntense wildfires\n\nThe reason behind that, experts say, is the significantly increased intensity and size of wildfires.\n\nThat is why, they add, there are now concerns over possible notable rise of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe total global CO\u2082 emissions reached 32.5 billion tons last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Embers blow in the wind during this year's wildfires in California\n\nThere has, however, not been an exact quantification of emissions from recent wildfires and the one in California now.\n\nSome estimates suggest that the wildfire in northern California last year emitted as much CO\u2082 in a week as what all of the cars and trucks in the state do in a year.\n\nThat is why some fire experts in that US state fear that its level of CO\u2082 emissions could endanger its progress toward meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\nOther hotspots\n\nWhile California and Australia are most of the time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE) has a similar view.\n\n\"These (California) fires are likely fairly insignificant in terms of their global contribution to greenhouse gases,\" he said.\n\n\"At any one time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is something under your control,\" says Professor Vallejo.\n\n\"But wildfires are not something controllable like that. They will happen and will intensify in a warming world.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Exoplanet discovered around neighbouring star", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46196279", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: Barnard's Star b is thought to be quite cold\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet around one of the closest stars to our Sun.\n\nNearby planets like this are likely to be prime targets in the search for signatures of life, using the next generation of telescopes.\n\nThe planet's mass is thought to be more than three times bigger than our own, placing it in a category of world known as a \"super-Earth\".\n\nIt orbits Barnard's star, which sits \"just\" six light-years away.\n\nThe star is an extremely faint \"red dwarf\" that's about 3% as bright as the Sun.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature, Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9 and colleagues say its newly discovered planetary companion has a mass 3.2 times bigger than the Earth's.\n\nDr Anglada Escud\u00e9 said it was \"possibly a mostly rocky planet with a massive atmosphere. It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report says 'cut lamb and beef'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46214864", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says.\n\nThe shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.\n\nThe report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.\n\nThe farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers.\n\nBut environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid.\n\nThe CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.\n\nThe un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2.\n\nThe committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.\n\nBBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU.\n\nTurning farmland into forests\n\nThe chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.\n\n\u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nCarbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs.\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.\n\n\"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\"\n\nEarlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nThe environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet.\n\n\u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\"\n\nThere may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.\n\nA separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted.\n\nHow climate change is already changing the landscape\n\nThe CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse.\n\nLoss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production.\n\nProjections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought.\n\n\"Despite some opportunities,\u201d the report says,\"The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "\u2018The Powerpuff Girls\u2019 Turns 20", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/the-powerpuff-girls-turns-20-1830501521", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Nov. 18 marks 20 years since the debut of The Powerpuff Girls, the Craig McCracken\u2013created cartoon that follows three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Arab Media Report IS Fighters, Family Members Killed in US Coalition Airstrikes in Syria", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/coalition-strike-kills-40-in-syria/4662970.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:04", "body_paragraphs": "The head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that U.S.-led coalition airstrikes killed more than 40 people in the village of Abu Husn in the region of Deir el-Zor, near the Iraqi border.\n\nArab media announced the deaths of several dozen people, most of whom appeared to have been Islamic State group fighters, during bitter fighting in the Deir el-Zor region of eastern Syria, not far from the Iraqi border.\n\nRami Abdel Rahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims that about three dozen Islamic State fighters were killed in the airstrikes on the village of Abu Husn.

Many said they would stay there and wait for the rest of their caravan to arrive and for leaders to advise them of their options for seeking asylum in the United States.Some of the early arrivals went to the border fence to celebrate.\n\n\n\nThe migrants in Tijuana got a generally warm greeting from locals, but some were met with hostility from an upper middle-class beach neighborhood.\n\n\n\nResidents shouted, \"You're not welcome!\" and \"Get out!\" to a group of about 100 Central Americans. Police kept the two sides apart. One protester said the hostility had nothing to do with race, but with safety.\n\n\n\nA Tijuana city official said the city is not prepared for such a large number of arrivals. Most migrant shelters are already full. The official said she hopes the Mexican federal government will offer the migrants asylum and jobs.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the migrant caravan of about 4,000 people, mostly Honduras, is making its way through the state of Sonora and is expected to arrive soon in Tijuana.\n\n\n\nThe San Ysidro port linking Tijuana to the U.S. city of San Diego, is the busiest crossing on the border.

They see her as a skilled and tested leader prepared to confront Trump and deliver on priorities.\n\nPelosi, 78, first became speaker after Democrats took control of the House in midterm elections during former President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. With President Barack Obama, she was pivotal in passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nShe appears to be winning the outside game in her bid, amassing endorsements from a who\u2019s who of the nation\u2019s Democrats. Inside the Capitol she has support from influential lawmakers such as Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, and backing from some of the incoming House members.\n\nThe internal debate is spilling out nationally, especially on social media, where Democratic activists are publicly criticizing Democratic Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio and others leading the campaign to oust Pelosi.\n\nIt\u2019s not lost on supporters that a group made up of mostly men is leading the effort. On the list of 17 names who\u2019ve signed onto a letter against her, just three are women.\n\nWith a narrow Democratic majority, now at 231 seats in the 435-member House, Pelosi does not have much cushion to secure the 218 votes needed, assuming all Republicans vote against her, as expected. Some House races remain undecided and the Democratic majority could grow slightly.\n\nThere is a chance the math could shift in Pelosi\u2019s favor if lawmakers are absent or simply vote \u201cpresent,\u201d meaning she would need fewer than 218 votes for an absolute majority.\n\nTrump, trying to insert himself into the race, tweeted on Saturday that he could get Pelosi \u201cas many votes as she wants\u201d to become speaker. \u201cShe deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win!\u201d\n\nTrump included the twitter link for Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican who has said he could be open to backing Pelosi if she committed to changes that would shift some power from the House leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest postelection praise of Pelosi raises questions about his sincerity, given the Republicans\u2019 election playbook of trying to tie Democrats in competitive congressional districts to Pelosi every chance they can.

With a test vote looming in late November, and at least one potential Pelosi challenger stepping forward, Democrats are facing the uncomfortable prospect of the internal squabble that the speaker\u2019s vote Jan. 3 could drag on for weeks.\n\n\u201cI think chaos is good if it\u2019s productive. I think chaos is bad if it is too disruptive and it divides us too much,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose leaders were upbeat after meeting with Pelosi this past week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWe need to put forward the vision of who we are as a party and what we\u2019re fighting for and so that needs to happen very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nPelosi was expected to work the phones from California after meeting privately Friday with newly elected Democrats who could be crucial to her bid.\n\nThose incoming lawmakers indicated they were having good meetings with the leader, though few said the talks had changed their minds.\n\nRep.-elect Abigail Spanberger of Virginia said she had a \u201cwonderful conversation\u201d about her district\u2019s priorities, but \u201cwill not be voting\u201d for Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about wanting new leadership,\u201d said Spanberger, a former CIA operative who defeated tea party Republican Rep. Dave Brat in suburban Richmond. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything she could say, because the decision isn\u2019t about her.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he had a \u201cpleasant\u201d meeting, but remains a \u201cno\u201d on Pelosi. He is among 17 Democrats who have signed on to a letter opposing her. Van Drew said they discussed his districts and which committees he\u2019d like to serve on. \u201cI don\u2019t feel under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi also met for 45 minutes with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, a potential rival for the speakership who said the two had \u201ca very open and frank discussion,\u201d including about \u201cthe feeling in the caucus of people who are feeling left out and left behind.\u201d\n\nFudge said she would probably decide after Thanksgiving break whether she will run.\n\n\u201cTo her credit, she wanted to know what my concerns were,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cWhat she asked me was, basically, how we could get to a point where I\u2019m supportive.\u201d\n\nOne question for some Democrats is what, exactly, Pelosi means when she says she intends to be a transitional leader, a bridge to a new generation. She has led the party for 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe talked about some succession planning,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cI think it is something our caucus is interested in knowing.\u201d\n\nIf it were up to most of the Democratic Party, Pelosi easily would win. They see her as a skilled and tested leader prepared to confront Trump and deliver on priorities.\n\nPelosi, 78, first became speaker after Democrats took control of the House in midterm elections during former President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. With President Barack Obama, she was pivotal in passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nShe appears to be winning the outside game in her bid, amassing endorsements from a who\u2019s who of the nation\u2019s Democrats. Inside the Capitol she has support from influential lawmakers such as Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, and backing from some of the incoming House members.\n\nThe internal debate is spilling out nationally, especially on social media, where Democratic activists are publicly criticizing Democratic Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio and others leading the campaign to oust Pelosi.\n\nIt\u2019s not lost on supporters that a group made up of mostly men is leading the effort. On the list of 17 names who\u2019ve signed onto a letter against her, just three are women.\n\nWith a narrow Democratic majority, now at 231 seats in the 435-member House, Pelosi does not have much cushion to secure the 218 votes needed, assuming all Republicans vote against her, as expected. Some House races remain undecided and the Democratic majority could grow slightly.\n\nThere is a chance the math could shift in Pelosi\u2019s favor if lawmakers are absent or simply vote \u201cpresent,\u201d meaning she would need fewer than 218 votes for an absolute majority.\n\nTrump, trying to insert himself into the race, tweeted on Saturday that he could get Pelosi \u201cas many votes as she wants\u201d to become speaker. \u201cShe deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win!\u201d\n\nTrump included the twitter link for Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican who has said he could be open to backing Pelosi if she committed to changes that would shift some power from the House leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest postelection praise of Pelosi raises questions about his sincerity, given the Republicans\u2019 election playbook of trying to tie Democrats in competitive congressional districts to Pelosi every chance they can. GOP lawmakers considering endorsing Pelosi would open themselves up to a potential primary challenges in 2020 for daring to support someone their base has reviled."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Says Written Responses Go to Mueller Team Next Week", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-written-responses-go-to-mueller-team-next-week/4662833.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:07", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump says he \u201cvery easily\u201d answered written questions from special counsel Robert Mueller, though he speculated that the questions had been \u201ctricked up\u201d to try to catch him in a lie.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all done,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House early Saturday before leaving for California, adding that his responses will soon be submitted to Mueller\u2019s team. \u201cWe do that next week,\u201d he said, in what signals a new phase of the inquiry.\n\nIn a swipe the day before at the investigation into 2016 election interference and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign, the president said that \u201cyou have to always be careful when you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions.\u201d\n\nMueller has signaled a willingness to accept written answers on matters related to collusion with Russia. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said repeatedly the president would not answer Mueller\u2019s questions on possible obstruction of justice.\n\nDuring months of back-and-forth negotiations with the special counsel office, Trump\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly counseled the president against sitting down for an in-person interview.\n\nMueller\u2019s year-and-a-half-long investigation has produced guilty pleas and convictions from several top Trump aides even as the special counsel and the White House have engaged in lengthy negotiations about how \u2014 or if \u2014 the president would testify.\n\nThough he spent hours with his attorneys, Trump on Friday insisted: \u201cMy lawyers don\u2019t write answers, I write answers.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks were fresh evidence of his return to the ominous rhythms of the Russia probe after spending heady weeks enjoying adulation-soaked campaign rallies before the midterm elections.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s \u201cvery happy\u201d with how things are going, his frustrations with the probe have been evident everywhere from his Twitter feed this past week to his private grousing that the special counsel may target his family. There\u2019s also the criticism he\u2019s getting over his choice for acting attorney general, as well as late-arriving election results that have largely been tipping toward House Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday. The investigators don\u2019t care \u201chow many lives they can ruin,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA day later, he tried to put a rosier shine on the situation, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be just fine.\u201d\n\nThe president continued to maintain his innocence while launching new broadsides.\n\nAfter a relative lull in the run-up to the midterms, the Russia probe has returned to the forefront of Washington conversation. There has been widespread media coverage of two Trump allies \u2014 Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi \u2014 who say they expect to be charged.\n\nThe president has expressed concerns behind closed doors that Mueller is closing in on his inner circle, including potentially his eldest son.\n\nFor months, Trump has told confidants he fears that Donald Trump Jr., perhaps inadvertently, broke the law by being untruthful with investigators in the aftermath of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, according to one Republican close to the White House.\n\nTrump has also complained about efforts in the Senate by his longtime foe, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, to introduce legislation to protect the special counsel, according to the officials and Republicans.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has told confidants in recent days that he is deeply frustrated by widespread criticism of his choice of Matthew Whitaker for acting attorney general, according to four officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Whitaker has been a vocal opponent of the special counsel probe.\n\nOne argument against Whitaker was that he has not been confirmed by Senate. Trump contends that the criticism is unfair because Mueller also was not confirmed for his post. The special counsel position does not require confirmation, and the former FBI director was confirmed for that previous job.\n\nThe president also took note of news coverage of his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, arriving in Washington this past week, potentially to meet with Mueller\u2019s investigators. Cohen has pleaded guilty to a series of crimes and has said under oath that Trump ordered him to make hush-money payments to cover up an affair. He has undertaken an unlikely public relations tour as he looks to make a deal to reduce his prison sentence.\n\nThe renewed focus on the looming threat from Mueller comes as Trump settles back into the day-to-day routines of governing after the whirlwind campaign in which he spent weeks in front of adoring rally crowds while whipping up his base with harsh rhetoric about migrants moving through Mexico.\n\nHe faced criticism from both sides of the aisle for his weekend trip to Paris, during which he scuttled a visit to a World War I ceremony due to bad weather and further strained ties with traditional Western allies.\n\nOn other topics:\n\n\u2014 Despite his insistence that Americans no longer have to fear North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, news of Pyongyang\u2019s persistent weapons program made headlines this week.\n\n\u2014 And the White House is hurriedly stepping up efforts to prepare for a series of investigations certain to be launched by Democrats once they take control of the House in January.\n\nEven as Trump mused in the West Wing about making staffing changes, he pushed back against media coverage of his recent setbacks.\n\n\u201cThe White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWe are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible!

Her extraordinary call for the removal of a top administration official forced the president to banish a top aide, exacerbated tensions within the White House and provided fresh insight into the first marriage.\n\nAbove all, the moment showed that the enigmatic first lady is increasingly prepared to flex her muscles. While it was President Donald Trump who repeatedly promised to shake up his Cabinet and staff, it was his wife who forced one of the first moves after the midterm elections. And while first ladies have long held unique positions of influence in the White House, Mrs. Trump\u2019s very public power play was an unusual move befitting an unconventional White House.\n\n\u201cThere have been similar activities on a less publicized scale, but it came out after the fact. We\u2019ve never seen a first lady have her office make a public statement like that,\u201d said Katherine Jellison, chair of the history department at Ohio University and an expert on first ladies. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if this is the new Melania.\u201d\n\nJellison and others said the best comparison would be Nancy Reagan\u2019s conflict with White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan. But while that clash eventually became well known, Mrs. Reagan never issued a public statement.\n\nMrs. Trump, who appeared with her husband Friday at a White House ceremony to honor Medal of Freedom honorees, did not address the controversy directly.\n\nThe target of Mrs. Trump\u2019s ire was Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, who was said to have clashed with East Wing staff over logistics for the first lady\u2019s trip to Africa last month.\n\nA White House official said Mrs. Trump\u2019s staff spent weeks working through \u201cproper channels\u201d to seek Ricardel\u2019s ouster but that the situation came to a head earlier this week after reporters learned of the friction between Ricardel and the East Wing and began asking questions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.\n\nOn Tuesday, the East Wing issued a terse and head-snapping statement about Ricardel: \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d\n\nA day later, Ricardel was gone from the White House.\n\nThe statement from Mrs. Trump\u2019s office caught some senior White House officials by surprise. A White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly said there was a widespread feeling that the highly public spat reflected poorly on the West and East wings, reinforcing the idea that the administration is volatile and making the first lady look vengeful.\n\nBoth President Trump\u2019s spokeswoman and National Security Adviser John Bolton issued glowing statements about Ricardel. The White House insisted she would move into a new administration role, though it was not clear what that position would be. Privately, insiders acknowledged that there was no way for Ricardel to stay in the West Wing once the first lady made her feelings known.\n\nAs the week closed, it appeared clear that the situation had heightened already fraught tensions between the two wings of the White House, with senior officials from Chief of Staff John Kelly and Bolton on down unhappy with how Ricardel, a Trump loyalist, was treated.\n\nMrs. Trump is considered an influential adviser to her husband. In an ABC News interview last month, she said there are people in the White House whom she and the president cannot trust. She declined to name anyone but said she had let the president know who they are.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she added, \u201csome people, they don\u2019t work there anymore.\u201d\n\nAsked if some untrustworthy people still worked in the White House, Mrs. Trump replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe first lady has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is an entirely voluntary role. She opted to stay in New York for the first months of the administration so that the couple\u2019s son Barron could conclude the school year and she has kept up a limited public schedule since arriving in Washington.\n\nShe has also taken pains to set herself apart from the rest of the White House and her husband. She launched an education campaign focused on bullying, despite the fact that the president is famed for verbal combat. She took an ambitious trip to Africa, not long after her husband was pilloried for labeling African nations as \u201cs---hole countries.\u201d\n\nClearly unafraid to make a deft pushback at times, the first lady\u2019s office last summer put out a statement praising NBA superstar LeBron James\u2019 charitable efforts after the president fired off a tweet questioning the basketball player\u2019s intelligence. And when The New York Times reported that Trump was irate that his wife\u2019s TV aboard Air Force One was tuned to CNN, her office issued a statement saying Mrs. Trump watches \u201cany channel she wants.\u201d\n\nAs for the matter of fighting cyberbullying when her husband gets rapped for his cyber habits, the first lady told an online safety conference on Thursday that \u201cIt is not news or surprising to me that critics and the media have chosen to ridicule me for speaking out on this issue, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nBefore her husband reversed himself and put a halt to family separations at the border, Mrs. Trump\u2019s office put out a statement saying the first lady \u201chates\u201d to see families separated and expressing hope that \u201cboth sides of the aisle\u201d can reform the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nMrs. Trump then drew attention for heading to Texas to visit migrant children at the southern border in a jacket emblazoned with the words \u201cI don\u2019t really care. Do U?\u201d She later told ABC News that she wore the jacket \u201cfor the people and for the left-wing media who are criticizing me. And I want to show them that I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe first lady this week also made it clear she doesn\u2019t need outside help carving out her role in the White House, after her predecessor Michelle Obama said that Mrs. Trump had never called her for advice or help in the job.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump is a strong and independent woman who has been navigating her role as first lady in her own way,\u201d spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham wrote via email. \u201cWhen she needs advice on any issue, she seeks it from her professional team within the White House.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Federal Judge Orders White House to Return Press Pass to CNN Reporter", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-judge-orders-white-house-to-return-press-pass-to-cnn-reporter/4662677.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:09", "body_paragraphs": "A federal judge ordered the White House to temporarily reinstate a Cable News Network correspondent's press credentials, marking what press freedom advocates say is a win for the news media.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889.\n\nBut now, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: Some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called the update \"the greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\" which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nJon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said the vote left him \"a basket case\" and \"extremely emotional.\"\n\n\"Those units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don't know,\" he said. \"That was just leaving me in a puddle of tears.\"\n\nThe Grand K and its six official copies, kept together in the same safe on the edge of Paris and collectively known as the \"heir and the spares,\" will be retired but not forgotten. Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses decay over time.\n\nBenefits of the change\n\nThe change will have no discernable impact for most people.

Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nReuters Former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, left, and former Khmer Rouge leader \"Brother Number Two\" Nuon Chea were found guilty of genocide on Friday.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution. Nuon Chea was considered the main ideologist of the Khmer Rouge and the right-hand man of the group\u2019s late leader, Pol Pot, while Khieu Samphan served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Scholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nMembers of the Cham community were among the large crowd of spectators who attended Friday\u2019s session.\n\nThe court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for insuffient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u201cauto-genocide\u201d through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nOne of the spectators at Friday\u2019s hearing was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed by the Khmer Rouge, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\u201cToday, I am very happy that the both Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\u201d\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van to the courthouse from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nNuon Chea, who suffers heart problems, was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nIn addition to the two, the tribunal in 2010 convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunal\u2019s accomplishments."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "British Prime Minister Hangs By A Thread As Top Leaders Quit Over Brexit Deal", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/british-prime-minister-teresa-may-ministers-quit-brexit_us_5bed9d62e4b03af89267ca22", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:16", "body_paragraphs": "The British prime minister was clinging to power by the thinnest of threads on Thursday after a wave of resignations from her Cabinet and the beginnings of a political coup to oust her as leader.\n\nTheresa May presented her draft deal for the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union on Wednesday evening in a mammoth five-hour meeting with her top ministers.

Raab is the second Brexit secretary to quit over May\u2019s plans to leave the EU, the biggest shift in British policy in more than 40 years.\n\nBy leaving now, some suggested that Raab could be positioning himself as a possible successor to May.\n\nBut the prime minister showed little sign of backing down in parliament, where she warned lawmakers they now faced a stark decision - choose to leave with no deal, risk Brexit never happening or back her deal.\n\n\u201cThe choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated,\u201d she said.\n\nShe acknowledged that hammering out an agreement with her cabinet was not \u201ca comfortable process.\u201d\n\nBut she told those lawmakers who believed she could get a deal that did not include a backstop arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland that they were wrong.\n\nSTRATEGY IN DOUBT\n\nIt was the backstop arrangement, which would see Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory, that spurred her Brexit secretary and work and pensions minister to resign.\n\n\u201cAbove all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election,\u201d Raab said.\n\n\u201cThis is, at its heart, a matter of public trust,\u201d Raab said. \u201cI cannot support the proposed deal.\u201d\n\nLess than five months until Britain leaves the EU on March 29, the resignations put May\u2019s Brexit strategy in doubt.\n\nEU leaders are ready to meet on Nov. 25 to sign off on the divorce deal, or Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe summed up the uncertainty, saying events in London raised concerns about whether the agreement would be ratified. \u201cWe need to prepare ourselves for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nSome lawmakers in London openly questioned whether May\u2019s government will survive.\n\nOne eurosceptic lawmaker in May\u2019s Conservative Party said more colleagues were either putting in letters to trigger a no confidence vote in her leadership or were increasingly minded to do so. A challenge is triggered if 48 Conservatives write such letters. May could be toppled if 158 of her 315 lawmakers vote against her.\n\n\u2018FALLING APART\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s opposition Labour Party said the government was \u201cfalling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her cabinet, let alone parliament and the people of our country,\u201d said Jon Trickett, a member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior team.\n\nRaab, 44, was appointed to the role of Brexit secretary in July this year following the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May\u2019s Brexit strategy.\n\nAt the heart of Raab\u2019s criticism of May\u2019s deal was the belief that the pursuit of a customs union with the EU would be the \u201cstarting point\u201d for talks on the future relationship with the bloc, \u201cseverely prejudicing\u201d what Britain could achieve.\n\nHe said May\u2019s plan threatened the integrity of Britain and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement - to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland - where the EU had a veto over Britain\u2019s ability to exit.\n\nThe backstop arrangement to come into force if a future trade deal does not prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland has long been the main obstacle not only to a deal with the bloc, but to any agreement of her top ministers.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up May in parliament, had threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop meant the province was treated differently from the rest of mainland Britain.\n\n\u201cNo democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,\u201d Raab said in his resignation letter.\n\nEurosceptics in May\u2019s party have long feared that the prime minister was leading Britain towards a customs union with the EU, something that, they say, would mean a Brexit in name only.\n\nNigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, welcomed the resignations, praising the ministers for standing up for \u201cthe Union.\u201d\n\n(Additional reporting by Sarah Young, Kate Holton, Guy Faulconbridge; Writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Emotional Video Shows Woman Reunite With Cat Who Ran Off Into California Wildfire", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-cat-california-wildfire-reunion-video_us_5bf04b36e4b0b84243e2c469", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:17", "body_paragraphs": "A heartwarming video shows the moment that a woman first lays eyes on the beloved cat she feared she had lost forever in Northern California\u2019s devastating Camp fire.\n\nLaci Ping and husband Curtis Mullins took their gray tabby, Mayson, with them when they evacuated.

Now they just need a speaker of the House.\n\nThe standoff over Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to regain the gavel intensified as Democrats left Washington for the Thanksgiving break in what has turned out to be an unsettling finish to an otherwise triumphant week that saw them welcome a historic class of newcomers to Capitol Hill and prepare to take control from Republicans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is jumping in to offer some help, saying Saturday that he could \u201cperform a wonderful service\u201d by rounding up Republican votes for Pelosi\u2019s candidacy. Trump says he genuinely likes Pelosi and looks forward to working with her, but it\u2019s an almost unheard of proposition for the party that relied on the California Democrat as a chief villain on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI would help Nancy Pelosi if she needs some votes,\u201d Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to survey the devastation from the California wildfires. \u201cI like her, can you believe it? I like Nancy Pelosi. She\u2019s tough and she\u2019s smart, but she deserves to be speaker, and now they\u2019re playing games with her, just like they\u2019ll be playing with me.\u201d\n\nPelosi, who was the first woman to become speaker and served from 2007 to 2011, was certain that she will hold that post again. Last week she dismissed a suggestion that she could rely on Republican support to help amass the House majority needed in January when Democrats take control of the chamber after this month\u2019s election victory.\n\n\u201cOh, please, no, never, never, never,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump went so far Saturday to tweet the name of one Republican congressman, Rep. Tom Reed of New York, who has said he could be open to backing Pelosi if she committed to changes that would shift some power from the House leadership. Reed is a part of the Problem Solvers Caucus, whose members have broached the idea as a show of bipartisanship to help reform Congress. Reed welcomed Trump\u2019s tweet Saturday even though GOP lawmakers considering endorsing Pelosi would open themselves up criticism in their 2020 re-election bids for daring to support someone their base has reviled.\n\n\u201cThe president understands Congress is broken,\u201d said Reed\u2019s spokesman Will, Reinert. Reed has said for months \u201che\u2019s open to voting for anyone who promises to reform the House of Representatives for the American people.\u201d\n\nPelosi met with the group last week, but not with Reed or other Republicans.\n\n\u201cLeader Pelosi will win the speakership with Democratic votes,\u201d her spokesman Drew Hammill said Saturday.\n\nPelosi was expected to work the phones from California during the break after meeting privately with newly elected Democrats who could be crucial to her bid. Her foes were equally confident they have the votes to stop her ascension.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s a band of disgruntled Democrats, led mostly by men, in the forefront of the opposition. With a test vote looming in late November, and at least one potential Pelosi challenger stepping forward, Democrats are facing the uncomfortable prospect of the internal squabble that the speaker\u2019s vote Jan. 3 could drag on for weeks.\n\n\u201cI think chaos is good if it\u2019s productive. I think chaos is bad if it is too disruptive and it divides us too much,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose leaders were upbeat after meeting with Pelosi this past week.\n\nNewly elected lawmakers indicated they were having good meetings with the leader, though few said the talks had changed their minds.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about wanting new leadership,\u201d said Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former CIA operative who defeated tea party Republican Rep. Dave Brat in suburban Richmond. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything she could say, because the decision isn\u2019t about her.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he had a \u201cpleasant\u201d meeting, but remains a \u201cno\u201d on Pelosi. He is among 17 Democrats who have signed on to a letter opposing her. Van Drew said they discussed his districts and which committees he\u2019d like to serve on. \u201cI don\u2019t feel under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi also has met with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, a potential rival for the speakership who said the two had \u201ca very open and frank discussion.\u201d\n\nFudge said she would probably decide after Thanksgiving break whether she will run.\n\n\u201cTo her credit, she wanted to know what my concerns were,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cWhat she asked me was, basically, how we could get to a point where I\u2019m supportive.\u201d\n\nOne question for some Democrats is what, exactly, Pelosi means when she says she intends to be a transitional leader, a bridge to a new generation. She has led the party for 15 years.\n\nIf it were up to most of the Democratic Party, Pelosi easily would win. They see her as a skilled and tested leader prepared to confront Trump and deliver on priorities.\n\nPelosi, 78, first became speaker after Democrats took control of the House in midterm elections during former President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. With President Barack Obama, she was pivotal in passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nWith a narrow Democratic majority, now at 231 seats in the 435-member House, Pelosi does not have much cushion to secure the 218 votes needed, assuming all Republicans vote against her, as expected. Some House races remain undecided and the Democratic majority could grow slightly.\n\nThere is a chance the math could shift in Pelosi\u2019s favor if lawmakers are absent or simply vote \u201cpresent,\u201d meaning she would need fewer than 218 votes for an absolute majority.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker Hit With Supreme Court Challenge", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matthew-whitaker-supreme-court-acting-attorney-general_us_5bef985ee4b07573881eb390", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:18", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump's choice of Matthew Whitaker to run the Justice Department is under attack in the courts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general was challenged Friday in a surprise motion calling on the Supreme Court to substitute Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein instead.\n\nVeteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein argues that Whitaker \u2014 a Trump loyalist who was appointed to his post by the president last week \u2014 cannot take over for ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Whitaker hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe unusual vehicle for the challenge is a gun rights lawsuit that was initially filed against Sessions in his former capacity as attorney general.

It too argued that Rosenstein be installed in Whitaker\u2019s place.\n\nWhitaker is under pressure to recuse himself from anything to do with the ongoing investigation into possible Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. He previously expressed disdain for the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has issued an opinion supporting Trump\u2019s authority to appoint Whitaker.\n\nThe lawsuit linked to Friday\u2019s challenge was brought by Barry Michaels, a Nevada man convicted of securities fraud two decades ago, who wants the Supreme Court to rule that people convicted of certain non-violent felonies should not lose the right to own a gun.

Her 6-year-old son had been removed from her care for more than a month. She was forced to close an in-home child care business, and she\u2019d been temporarily displaced from her preschool teaching job, which she\u2019d held for 17 years. Her teenage daughter refused to talk to the 6-year-old, blaming him for the family\u2019s troubles.\n\nBanks didn\u2019t blame her little boy. She blamed his school, and the investigators from the state\u2019s child welfare agency they\u2019d sent to her door.\n\nUntil last fall, Banks had only good things to say about her children\u2019s school. She\u2019d carefully chosen the K-8 institution, a magnet school across town from her single-family house on Chicago\u2019s West Side, for its academic rigor and diverse student body. Her daughter, now 16, had thrived there, she said, and her middle son did well too. But when her youngest son entered first grade last year, he started misbehaving and making trouble for teachers. \u201cHe really struggles behavior-wise,\u201d said Banks, a tall, self-assured woman who\u2019d attended neighborhood public schools in Chicago and desperately wanted something different for her kids. \u201cAnd at this school they have a low tolerance for it.\u201d\n\nThe school wanted the boy to enroll in classes exclusively for students with disabilities. But Banks felt differently: Despite his behavior problems, for which he was eventually diagnosed with attention deficit and mood disorders, he did well academically, she said. Banks pushed back, going so far as to make complaints to the city\u2019s education board and entering mediation with the school.\n\nThis was unfolding around the time the workers from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, or DCFS, began investigating her for alleged child abuse and neglect.\n\nSchool employees in most states have a legal obligation to report any suspicion of abuse and neglect, and they can play a critical role in helping keep children out of harm\u2019s way. But in nearly three dozen interviews conducted by The Hechinger Report and HuffPost, parents, lawyers, advocates and child welfare officials said that schools occasionally wield this authority in inappropriate ways. Fed up with what they see as obstinate parents who don\u2019t agree to special education services for their child, or disruptive kids who make learning difficult, schools sometimes use the threat of a child-protection investigation to strong-arm parents into complying with the school\u2019s wishes or transferring their children to a new school. That approach is not only improper, but it can be devastating for families, even if the allegations are ultimately determined to be unfounded.\n\nBanks\u2019 first brush with DCFS came after the school sent her son to the hospital because he was acting out, she said. They wanted him to receive a psychiatric evaluation, she said, but Banks refused because he already had an appointment with his doctor for the following week. The second time a caseworker investigated her, she said, it was because her son\u2019s doctor had prescribed him a new medication and the school hadn\u2019t been properly notified. Next came an investigation after her middle child wrote a paper that Banks was told contained troubling content. One time, she gave her youngest son a spanking for running away from school. After he told school employees about it the next day, he was removed from her home for more than a month and sent to live with her sister-in-law while the child welfare agency investigated her for abuse, according to Banks. The most recent case was the most incomprehensible to her: Banks said she was investigated for letting her middle child go to school with a bad haircut he\u2019d given himself. The haircut, Banks said she was told by an investigator, could amount to emotional abuse.\n\nAs a teacher, Banks herself had sometimes called the state child welfare hotline over the years, when she worried that her students were being abused or neglected. But in her case, she believes the school simply wanted her son gone. Banks said she\u2019d heard from a handful of other parents who\u2019d found themselves in similar situations, all of whom are African-American like her and whose children have disabilities. \u201cAll I\u2019m looking for is a good education for my kid,\u201d said Banks. She felt the allegations against her had been twisted and exaggerated to fit a narrative that she was a bad mother. \u201cIt severed the relationship that we\u2019re supposed to have as a parent and teacher community.\u201d\n\nCalling ACS is one of the tools in [a school\u2019s] repertoire to make the parents comply. Irene Mendez, a staff attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest\n\nEmily Bolton, a spokesperson for the Chicago Public Schools, wrote in an email that the agency cannot comment on specific cases but that employees take seriously their responsibility as mandated reporters of abuse and neglect, and that there is no evidence of widespread misuse of the DCFS child-welfare hotline.\n\nBut even some former child welfare officials say the practice isn\u2019t as rare as they\u2019d like. \u201cIf schools don\u2019t get the parents to agree to what\u2019s being recommended \u2014 not all the time, but sometimes \u2014 they will call ACS [the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, New York City\u2019s child welfare agency] to pressure them,\u201d said Don Lash, a former lawyer with ACS and author of the book, \u201c \u2018When the Welfare People Come\u2019: Race and Class in the US Child Protection System.\u201d\n\nHe and many other experts also note that because of legitimate fears of overlooking kids at risk and vague definitions of abuse and neglect, school workers may sometimes be overzealous, calling in allegations over relatively minor issues such as broken eyeglasses, inappropriate clothing or small scratches. In interviews, more than a dozen lawyers said these investigations disproportionately affect low-income families of color, who tend to live in neighborhoods and attend schools that have bigger police and social services presences and whose children are more likely to show markings of poverty that can be confused with neglect.\n\nSuch families also have fewer resources to fight back. When a family in a wealthy Brooklyn neighborhood learned roughly two years ago that their child\u2019s school had initiated an ACS investigation against them, they sued the city education department. Parents from lower-income, majority-black and Latino neighborhoods, few of whom can afford that option, say such investigations can be a regular, even expected, part of parenting. According to ACS data, there were 2,391 abuse and neglect investigations last year in East New York/Starrett City, a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn, compared with 255 in the affluent, and far more populous, Upper East Side.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can think of a white family where I\u2019ve ever seen it arise,\u201d Chris Gottlieb, co-director of New York University\u2019s Family Defense Clinic, which represents clients in child welfare cases, said of these types of school-driven investigations.\n\nAn Intimidation Tool?\n\nAccusations that officials with Success Academy Charter Schools have sometimes threatened parents with ACS involvement have been a focal point of legal and civil complaints against the charter school network, New York City\u2019s largest. One lawsuit against a Success Academy school in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn alleges that the school unfairly singled out kids with disabilities for discipline. In an August ruling allowing the suit to proceed, a judge said allegations that school employees called police or child protective services on 4- and 5-year olds, would, if true, help to demonstrate enough \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to sustain the discrimination claims.\n\nNicey Givens, one of the parents in the suit, said she was told at least twice that Success might involve ACS if she didn\u2019t quickly pick up her child from school in the middle of the day. The boy, who\u2019d been given diagnoses of attention deficit and oppositional defiant disorder, often misbehaved, and Givens said she felt the school was pressuring her to remove him. Once, she said, the threat to involve ACS came after she\u2019d sent the boy to school in boots instead of his uniform shoes on a cold, wet day.\n\nOur focus is always on the student, the child. Not to say that the parent doesn\u2019t matter and those kinds of investigations can\u2019t be awkward and disruptive, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry, and there are just too many examples that you read of something that was overlooked. Ann Powell, executive vice president of public affairs, Success Academy charter network\n\n\u201cCalling ACS is one of the tools in their repertoire to make the parents comply,\u201d said Irene Mendez, a staff attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, one of several groups that filed the suit. A 2016 civil complaint filed with the federal Department of Education includes an allegation that a Success school in Manhattan initiated an ACS investigation against the mother of a 6-year-old as part of an effort to encourage her to send him to another school. Another lawsuit alleges that one of the network\u2019s Bronx schools repeatedly threatened to call ACS to pressure a parent to remove her son from the school.\n\nSuccess Academy officials dispute the suggestion that any of the network\u2019s schools misuse calls to ACS. Ann Powell, executive vice president of public affairs for the charter network, said she could not comment on the specifics in the lawsuit involving the Fort Greene school because it is ongoing, but said that the network disagreed with the way Givens described her interactions with the school. Success also disputes the allegations made against the Manhattan and Bronx schools. Powell noted that as legally mandated reporters of child abuse, school employees must report any suspicion of abuse and neglect, and that \u201cusing that in a threatening way is just not credible.\u201d\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost The Hankinses with their son David. A family court judge rejected the New York City Department of Education\u2019s allegation that the couple had neglected their child by keeping him out of school and having \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d for his education.\n\nA Legal Obligation\n\nMandated reporter laws date to the 1960s, and in most states, school employees are among the professionals (along with doctors, social workers and others) obligated to report any suspicion of abuse or neglect. Mandated reporter trainings remind school employees that it\u2019s not their responsibility to decide whether abuse is taking place but simply to pick up the phone if they have a concern, and the child welfare agency will take over from there. Mandated reporters typically have immunity from prosecution for making needless calls, so long as those calls are made in good faith.\n\n\u201cAll of the pressure on mandated reporters is to report, report, report,\u201d said Richard Wexler, executive director of the nonprofit National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.\n\nIf they fail to report their suspicions, and something terrible happens to the child, they can face fines or even jail time and wind up on the front page of a newspaper. Child welfare is often described as being caught in a scandal-reform cycle, with reports of neglect and entrances to foster care rising after high-profile child deaths. Both Chicago and New York are dealing with the repercussions of recent scandals \u2014 Chicago Tribune reporting on sex abuse in schools is spurring fresh resources and protocols, while in New York, calls to the child abuse hotline spiked after the deaths of two young boys under ACS monitoring in 2016.\n\n\u201cOur focus is always on the student, the child,\u201d said Powell, the Success Academy VP. \u201cNot to say that the parent doesn\u2019t matter and those kinds of investigations can\u2019t be awkward and disruptive, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry, and there are just too many examples that you read of something that was overlooked.\u201d\n\nSchool officials also note that they have a unique responsibility in policing child neglect in many states. Child welfare laws in New York and 23 other states (not Illinois) list the denial of education as a form of abuse or neglect. In some parts of New York, school employees are required to initiate educational neglect allegations if a child has a prolonged absence and parents don\u2019t respond to the school. Last year, school personnel in New York City made 16,301 reports to ACS, more than any other type of mandated reporter, according to agency data provided to Hechinger/HuffPost. Of those, about 43 percent involved an allegation of educational neglect.\n\nBut critics say these too are misused or fall into gray areas of the law. Phillip and Tina Hankins, a couple in the South Bronx, have been tussling with the New York City Department of Education for more than a decade over where and how to educate their son David, who has a disability. They\u2019ve been investigated at least seven times by ACS, including on occasions when they kept David out of class while fighting to get him into what they considered to be a more suitable institution, documentation shows.\n\n\u201cThe schools have the right to call in whatever they think is not appropriate,\u201d said Baffour Acheampong, an ACS worker who investigated several of the Hankins\u2019 cases. \u201cBut in dealing with Mrs. and Mr. Hankins, what I saw was they have the best interests of their son.\u201d\n\nOn the one occasion that ACS substantiated an educational neglect allegation against the Hankinses, a family court judge later overturned that finding. The judge noted that David\u2019s intelligence test scores actually improved when the boy was kept out of school awaiting placement, and that the Hankinses had been doing all they could to fight for educational services. \u201cIn light of the Appellants\u2019 year-long battle to get the child into an appropriate school, it is not clear what else they could have done to have enrolled David,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that the agency did not provide a \u201csingle credible instance where they failed to exercise the required minimum degree of care.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions about this case, spokesperson for the New York City schools Miranda Barbot said that the Department of Education works \u201cclosely with families to support them,\u201d and \u201cwhen there is reasonable cause to suspect abuse or neglect, we have clear policies in place that ensure it is reported.\u201d\n\nMichael Arsham, executive director of ACS\u2019s Office of Advocacy, which responds to complaints from those involved in the child welfare system, said the agency acknowledges that hotline calls from schools do not always contain serious safety concerns, and it is working more closely with the education department to minimize needless reporting. Two years ago, ACS developed a \u201ctiered response\u201d system with the DOE to prioritize urgent matters and reduce the impact on families of investigations over smaller concerns. \u201cWe do want people to call potential dangers to children to our attention,\u201d Arsham said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s fair for us to expect other human services professionals \u2014 whether they be in education, health care, anybody who is a mandated reporter \u2014 to use their independent judgment and discretion and understand there are consequences to making that call.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very hard because the whole system isn\u2019t adequate in addressing families\u2019 needs. It would be much easier to call ACS if you could count on them as a holistic agency to families that are marginalized. Leila Ortiz, social worker in New York City public schools\n\nPart of the challenge facing school officials, according to Leila Ortiz, a social worker in New York City public schools, is that ACS is primarily oriented to investigate families, not provide support. Chronic absenteeism could indeed be the canary in the coal mine, she said, signaling deeper troubles within a family. \u201cIf you don\u2019t call that in, something could potentially be happening to the student,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, they\u2019re not in the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the same time,\u201d Ortiz added, \u201cyou could be adding more stress and damage to a family that already has a lot on their plate. It\u2019s very hard because the whole system isn\u2019t adequate in addressing families\u2019 needs. It would be much easier to call ACS if you could count on them as a holistic agency to families that are marginalized.\u201d\n\nAntagonistic Approach\n\nDespite ACS\u2019s efforts to be more sensitive to families facing investigations, parents don\u2019t tend to experience child welfare investigations as even remotely helpful. A New York City parent named Gabriela \u2014 who is going by her middle name for this article because her case is still ongoing and she fears retaliation \u2014 knows the type of havoc that a call to ACS can wreak on a family. Over the course of her decades-long career as an advocate for immigrants in East Harlem, she has developed an acute understanding of ways in which families can get unfairly wrapped up in an opaque process. Some of these cases have made sense to her. Many more have seemed unfounded, with cultural differences in child-rearing clearly playing a role.\n\nBut she never expected to have to use this ACS expertise with her own family.\n\nLast January, when Gabriela received a knock on the door of her Bronx home from an ACS caseworker, she was shocked to learn that she was the subject of a child abuse investigation. Even more surprising was the source of the complaint: her 10-year-old child\u2019s school.\n\nDays prior, Gabriela\u2019s daughter had gone to her teacher with a secret: That her daddy \u2014 amid grief from the death of his mother \u2014 had started regularly drinking. Gabriela said that she had tried to keep this behavior from her daughter, and thought she hadn\u2019t noticed the new wrinkles in family life.\n\nWhat happened next was a whirlwind. The child, hysterically crying and scared, was pulled into a room with several adults and questioned about her home life. Under pressure \u2014 and wanting to provide the right answer \u2014 she said that her mom, Gabriela, had hit her, a charge that Gabriela denies.\n\nGabriela recognizes that the school was trying to help \u2014 and in some ways was carrying out a professional duty \u2014 but says they brought a \u201cnightmare to my house.\u201d\n\nA Mexican immigrant who came to America as a teenager, Gabriela has been deeply involved in the education of her daughter at every step. Over the years, Gabriela has taken the time to get to know her daughter\u2019s teachers and school principal, while advocating for the school\u2019s immigrant families who need extra services. How could the school\u2019s leaders, whom Gabriela knew so well, see her as anything less than a devoted parent?\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they use the social worker outside? Why didn\u2019t they call me with concerns? Why did they go straight for the kill and call ACS?\u201d questioned Gabriela.\n\nShe wonders if, in the delicate balancing act of being an involved parent but trying not to overstep her role, she landed on the wrong side of the equation. Or if, in her role as an advocate for immigrant families, she pushed too hard.\n\nShe also wonders if this process would have played out differently if she had a different ACS caseworker. (Charges against her were sustained and she is currently amid the appeals process.) This caseworker has asked her on three separate occasions about her immigration status, apparently unable to believe that Gabriela is an American citizen, Gabriela recounts.\n\n\u201cWhen you go through this, it\u2019s not just a nightmare for you, it\u2019s a nightmare for your child, because the stress level it creates for our family is horrible,\u201d said Gabriela, through tears, one Tuesday afternoon in August.\n\nA representative for the school said that all employees receive training on child abuse and follow state law regarding reporting.\n\nCaroline Preston/The Hechinger Report After an employee at her child\u2019s school reported Sandra for alleged abuse, she went from being very involved in her sons\u2019 education to being fearful of teachers and administrators.\n\nEven for parents who have their records cleared, the pernicious consequences of investigations can be permanent. In 2015, Sandra, a mother of three in Chicago, was investigated by DCFS after her youngest son went to school with what she describes as a minor scratch he sustained from roughhousing with his brothers.\n\nAfter a DCFS worker arrived on her doorstep, her entire life was thrown under suspicion. The flowers that were a Valentine\u2019s Day gift from her husband, for example? The investigator asked if they were evidence of her husband trying to repair damage from a marital fight.\n\nUltimately the abuse allegation against Sandra was overturned. But three years and $15,000 in legal fees later, she said she\u2019s still reluctant to meet with or talk to school employees. Recently, the assistant principal at her youngest son\u2019s school called Sandra and her husband in for a meeting to discuss the boy\u2019s behavior, as he\u2019d been getting frustrated in class and acting out. When the administrator suggested she take a stronger disciplinary approach, Sandra pushed back hard: \u201cI am not going to yell at him or touch him because you guys already put me through this one time.\u201d\n\nGrowing Awareness\n\nAccording to NYU\u2019s Gottlieb, there needs to be a greater understanding of the damage caused by needless investigations and the higher rates at which parents of color are caught up in them. \u201cYou want to help parents make better choices for their kids,\u201d she said, \u201cand starting out by saying, \u2018You\u2019re abusive,\u2019 is not the way to do it.\u201d\n\nOne step forward, say critics of child welfare, could be to modify mandated reporter training \u2014 by using it in part to educate people about implicit racial bias, for example. The training that has long been offered to Illinois\u2019 school employees is a one-time online course that takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete and includes no mention of race. Chicago Public Schools says that starting this year, it has begun offering an in-person, annual training.\n\nMeanwhile, experiments to reduce racial and socioeconomic inequities in the child welfare system have shown some success. New York\u2019s Nassau County was able to significantly reduce the numbers of black kids put in foster care after placing an emphasis on workforce diversity among human services employees and withholding children\u2019s demographic information from staff meetings. A second New York county, Onandaga, began removing fewer black kids from their parents after investing in afterschool and other school-based programs.\n\nIn New York City, ACS is rolling out a new approach to responding to low-risk calls that focuses on assessing which services fragile families need, said ACS\u2019s Arsham.\n\nNeil Skene, a spokesperson for the Illinois DCFS, wrote in an email that while a child welfare investigation is a \u201cpainful experience for anyone,\u201d the agency feels it has a \u201cparticular obligation to be responsive to the concerns and professional knowledge of mandated reporters.\u201d Skene added: \u201cWe are starting to work with local communities to identify cultural and racial disparities and how we can respond better.\u201d\n\nOut Of Options\n\nChange can\u2019t happen soon enough for families embroiled in school-driven investigations. For them, transferring schools can feel like the only way out.\n\nIn 2015, after the harassment Givens says she endured at Success Academy, she sent her son to a different elementary school nearby. \u201cFrom first to fourth grade, no problems, no incidents, no suspensions, no fighting, no nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen you go through this, it\u2019s not just a nightmare for you, it\u2019s a nightmare for your child, because the stress level it creates for our family is horrible. Gabriela, advocate and mother investigated by ACS\n\nGabriela\u2019s daughter has also switched schools, after feeling uncomfortable and mistrustful of the adults who called ACS on her parents. \u201cShe went from asking me, \u2018Please don\u2019t take me to school, can I stay with you?\u2019 \u201d Gabriela said of her daughter, \u201cto getting up in the morning, getting ready, excited to participate.\u201d\n\nBanks considered removing her two boys from their magnet school after the child-protection investigations began. Relatives, colleagues, even her kids\u2019 pediatrician \u2014 they all warned that the hotline calls wouldn\u2019t stop until her children left the school. Because she worked with kids, the investigations were particularly worrisome for her, she said, even though ultimately none of the cases against her had been substantiated.\n\nBut at the same time, she was reluctant. The magnet school offered four foreign languages, math teams and movie nights, things she worried her kids wouldn\u2019t get at their neighborhood school. \u201cI feel like they are winning,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand his behavior is poor,\u201d she said of her youngest son, \u201cbut he does deserve to be at a school where he can get a good education.\u201d\n\nPlus, by the time she came to grips with the unrelenting nature of the investigations, the December deadline for applying to specialized schools had already passed. She looked into private schools before deciding they were too expensive.\n\nThis fall, feeling out of options, she sent her boys back to the magnet school. On the second day of the semester, she texted: \u201cI am praying it is better this year.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Teen Sings Her Way Through Brain Surgery So Doctors Can Preserve Her Talent", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kira-iaconetti-sings-brain-surgery_us_5bef4f68e4b07573881e9d3d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:19", "body_paragraphs": "A Seattle teen is singing the praises of doctors who let her sing during brain surgery.\n\nMusician Kira Iaconetti, 19, has been performing musical theater since she was a child and has ambitions of making it a career.\n\nShe feared that might not happen after doctors diagnosed her with a form of epilepsy that triggered seizures when she listened to or performed music.\n\n\u201cIt just [felt] like a light switch switches in my brain and suddenly I\u2019m tone deaf.

A fire so devastating that hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Air so polluted that people without safety masks are trapped inside. A quarantine set up by the National Guard to limit the spread of a dangerous virus.\n\nThis is not the climactic scene of an apocalyptic horror movie, set far in the future. This is California in 2018.\n\nThe flames and smoke from the Camp fire ripping through Northern California \u2015 a record-breaking catastrophe that has claimed at least 63 lives with more than 600 people still missing \u2015 is the public health crisis that climate change researchers have been warning about.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a 55-and-older community in Paradise, California, was burned to the ground.\n\nIn Butte County, where the fire has been raging for more than a week, thousands of people have been evacuated to shelters set up in churches, high schools, fairgrounds and other sites. Many have lost their homes, loved ones and neighbors. The fire has destroyed nearly 10,000 residences so far, and over 15,000 more are threatened, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).\n\nRight now, though, there\u2019s another acute issue preoccupying evacuees and shelter workers.\n\nMore than 140 Camp fire evacuees huddled in crowded shelters are showing norovirus symptoms, the Butte County Public Health Department announced Thursday. That number is likely much higher now.\n\n\u201cThe number of sick people is increasing every day,\u201d a release from the health department stated. \u201cTwenty-five people have been to the hospital for medical support. Staff serving the shelters have also been sick.\u201d\n\nA visit to the East Avenue Church shelter in Chico shows just how quickly norovirus, the leading cause of foodborne illness, is spreading in a community that has already suffered through so much unforeseen devastation.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty people were camped at the church on Friday when illness erupted in one corner of the shelter\u2019s multipurpose room. Evacuees overcome with sudden vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration were eventually protected by a barrier as volunteers rushed to treat them. They were feet away from their fellow evacuees, wearing air filtration masks and precautionary adult diapers, hoping not to add illness to the others\u2019 long lists of misfortunes. While volunteers bleached floors covered in feces and vomit, some evacuees took to the bushes outside the shelter to relieve themselves. These are the indignities of a catastrophe that no one plans for.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost East Avenue Church Shelter in Chico, California, where norovirus has spread and makeshift quarantine barriers have been erected.\n\nIt\u2019s not 100 percent certain that all patients are suffering from norovirus specifically, but the threat the infection poses justifies a prompt response. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there are about 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly young children and the elderly, each year among those infected by it in the U.S.\n\nLater on Friday, the National Guard began setting up medical tents for Camp fire evacuees affected by norovirus in an attempt to better control its spread from shelter to shelter, all overcrowded with people made homeless by the fire and people who were already homeless but needed relief from the smoke. Some brought dogs and other pets.\n\nMeanwhile, counties more than a hundred miles from the fire are grappling with the health consequences of smoke that\u2019s settled around their homes.\n\nSince the Camp fire erupted on Nov. 8, the skies throughout the affected areas and spilling down into the San Francisco Bay Area have been brown and hazy. Visibility is poor. In San Francisco, the tops of buildings seem to disappear into the haze. Everywhere the air smells like fire.\n\nThat smoky, polluted air is full of microscopic pieces of particulate matter measuring roughly 2.5 micrometers or smaller, or PM 2.5. These particulates are too small to be caught by our lungs\u2019 filtration system and instead enter our bloodstreams, posing potential health risks to anyone breathing it but particularly to those with respiratory issues, as well as to older adults and children. Coughing, wheezing and other side effects have already affected many of those exposed to the abysmal air.\n\nThe Butte County Air Quality Management District reported \u201chazardous\u201d air quality in Paradise, where the fire started, and in nearby Chico, Oroville and Gridley. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AirNow site reported an Air Quality Index of 350 in Chico. For context, Delhi, India \u2015 one of the most notoriously polluted cities in the world \u2015 on Friday measured an AQI of about 240.\n\nEven the Bay Area, more than 165 miles from the epicenter of the Camp fire, is experiencing air quality conditions considered unsafe for anyone to go outside. The EPA measured an AQI of 238 in San Francisco on Friday.\n\nNorthern Californians take their good air for granted. Last year, San Francisco had 276 days with an AQI rating of \u201cgood.\u201d The average AQI in Delhi is \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS The Golden Gate Bridge is obscured by smoke and haze from wildfires Friday.\n\nMany schools and universities throughout the Bay Area have closed in recent days due to the poor air quality. Public schools in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano and Marin counties canceled classes on Friday due to the poor air quality. The University of California, Berkeley, San Francisco State University, California State University East Bay and other colleges closed their campuses, as well. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a \u201cSpare the Air\u201d alert effective from Thursday through Tuesday that includes a ban on \u201cburning wood, including manufactured fire logs or any other solid fuel, indoors or outdoors.\u201d\n\nEven San Francisco\u2019s famous cable cars were shut down on Friday.\n\nAuthorities also urged residents to stay indoors and to wear a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, marked N95 or higher, if and when they need to go outdoors.\n\nOne ACE hardware store in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district was out of masks Tuesday night but told customers a shipment of 1,000 more would be in the next morning. By Wednesday night, they were out again.\n\nThe shortage is standard across the city. Many vendors have limited customers to four masks per person. That limit has gone down to two in some places as supplies have dwindled.\n\nSmoke entering through the state\u2019s Central Valley is hovering in Bay Area counties, unable to escape through the Golden Gate, the National Weather Service explained. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of high daytime temperatures and low evening ones has triggered a phenomenon that traps the smoke close to the ground.\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS Pedestrians in San Francisco's Financial District wear protective masks against the hazardous air.\n\nThe particulates in wildfire smoke also have a somewhat different chemical makeup than the particles produced by cars and other daily sources of pollution. And it comes in short, intense episodes during and after a fire, which may present a different set of risks.\n\nNext to the immediate loss of life from the Camp fire, the air quality may seem a distant secondary concern. But how the poor air may affect survivors and other surrounding residents in the long term poses a frightening prospect.\n\nInhalation of PM 2.5 particles has been linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, asthma and other respiratory issues. PM exposure has also been linked to increased kidney disease risk and shortened life spans of those exposed to it in the womb.\n\nHazy conditions in the Bay Area are projected to persist over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. As for now, people\u2019s hope for relief from the smoke hinges on a chance of rain that may help clean the air late next week."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amy Schumer Reveals She's Suffering From Hyperemesis Gravidarum", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-schumer-pregnancy-hyperemesis-gravidarum_us_5bedd783e4b0b50c4899ccab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:20", "body_paragraphs": "Amy Schumer\u2019s pregnancy isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nThe comedian, who recently revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child with husband Chris Fischer, told her Instagram followers on Thursday that she\u2019s suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nThe condition, which Kate Middleton also dealt with in all three of her pregnancies, is marked by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dehydration during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI am in the hospital.

Sofia was one of 414 people diagnosed with a rare polio-like syndrome. Its cause continues to elude scientists. It is the latest challenge during a time when public health spending has declined.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nThe mysterious, polio-like disease that has struck 414 people \u2014 mostly young children \u2014 across the United States since 2014 comes at a time when the public health system already is overstretched.\n\nReported in 39 states and Washington, D.C., acute flaccid myelitis, known as AFM, causes muscle weakness and in some cases paralysis in the arms or legs, terrifying parents and puzzling medical researchers.\n\nThe disease has flared while state and federal governments largely have stopped making new investments in public health. While some infectious-disease experts think the CDC has taken too long to understand the cause of the disease, no high-profile critic has directly blamed the slow action on low public health funding.\n\nStill, many public health experts argue that the lack of investment further strains a system already stretched thin as it faces multiple challenges, including sharp upticks in sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis A and C, the opioid epidemic, seasonal flu viruses and frequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nThe low spending has thrown the U.S. public health system into \u201ccrisis,\u201d according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based research organization that promotes disease and injury prevention.\n\n\u201cInsufficient funding has hampered the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local health departments to keep pace with the new and continuing threats to the health of the American people and to fully fund prevention initiatives,\u201d the group said in a report this year on public health financing.\n\nState and local health departments must frequently shift personnel from one challenge to meet a new one, like AFM this year or the Zika virus a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen something unusual like this comes up, we don\u2019t have a pot of money to address that,\u201d said Kristen Ehresmann, Minnesota\u2019s director for infectious diseases. \u201cAnd neither does the CDC. We have to put staff on that new issue. You\u2019re constantly taking people off one thing in order to address another.\u201d\n\nCDC funding, three-fourths of which makes its way to local and state health departments, and public and private partners, in the form of grants, has lagged behind inflation since 2009 and has been almost flat since 2014. Notably, the portion of the agency\u2019s budget that goes to states for controlling infectious diseases \u00adhas also remained largely unchanged over the last four years.\n\nThe picture is similar if not worse at the state and local levels. State investment in public health funding ticked upward in the past decade only to fall below 2008 funding levels in 2015. According to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, 31 states reduced their spending on public health between fiscal 2016 and 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of County and City Health Officials estimates that since 2008, local health departments have lost 55,590 jobs through layoffs or attrition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much work, it\u2019s easy to lose focus,\u201d said Laura Power, who teaches epidemiology and internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cWhere do we put our effort? There\u2019s only so much money to go around.\u201d\n\nReporting Up\n\nAFM first drew attention in 2012 when the California Department of Public Health learned that a few children were suddenly afflicted with inexplicable weakness in their arms or legs. By the end of the year, 10 cases had been detected in the state.\n\nClinicians were not familiar with the disease; it was not one of the 120 illnesses that medical providers are required to report to their local or state health departments, which then report them to a disease surveillance system housed at the CDC.\n\nThose \u201cnotifiable diseases\u201d include infectious diseases such as meningitis, Legionnaires\u2019 disease and HIV, foodborne illnesses such as E. coli and non-infectious diseases, including cancer and lead poisoning. By reporting them up the chain, state and federal officials are able to see whether outbreaks are localized or widespread.\n\nBy 2014, AFM had been detected in 34 states. The CDC announced Tuesday that the number of confirmed cases for 2018 has climbed from the 72 reported last month to 90 across 27 states. The agency said it is investigating an additional 162 cases of patients with similar symptoms.\n\nAt this point, all states require health practitioners to report suspected cases.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical evidence gathered about the disease led the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, a collection of public health epidemiologists working as technical advisers to the CDC, to issue a case definition of the new disease in 2015 to help clinicians across the country recognize it.\n\nEven without knowing the cause of AFM, the CDC distributed information to local and state health departments and to clinicians on how to identify a possible case and what to look for in MRI tests. The agency also tentatively suggested ways to treat infected patients \u2014 mainly by quickly starting physical and rehabilitative therapy. The CDC said that about half of patients with AFM have recovered.\n\nThe agency also issued instructions on the type of specimens it needs to help understand the cause of the disease.\n\nThe CDC has research laboratories to investigate new diseases, as does the National Institutes of Health and academic medical systems, often operating under federal grants.\n\nTo nail down a cause for AFM, officials are looking to researchers at institutions such as the University of Tennessee Medical Center, the University of Colorado and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nParents and clinicians have criticized the CDC for the time it\u2019s taken to respond to the disease. Even some of the CDC\u2019s own medical advisers have complained. \u201cFrustrated and disappointed \u2014 I think that\u2019s exactly how most of us feel,\u201d Keith Van Haren, a neurologist at Stanford University Medical Center and a CDC medical adviser told CNN earlier this month.\n\n\u2018Nothing Makes You Feel Good\u2019\n\nSome parents have also bitterly complained that the CDC hasn\u2019t reported the deaths of some children from AFM. Nancy Messonnier, director of the agency\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a conference call with reporters Tuesday said the CDC could not specify the number of deaths linked to AFM because of a lack of follow-up investigation that it is now trying to correct.\n\nThe CDC said one person confirmed to have had AFM in 2017 died, although a spokeswoman, Kate Fowlie, said in an email, \u201cit is unclear what role AFM played in the death.\u201d She said no deaths among AFM patients have been reported to the agency this year.\n\nSince it appeared six years ago, AFM has spiked every other year, in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Many patients tested positive for an enterovirus known as D68, which was previously associated with respiratory symptoms but not weakness in the arms and legs. The link has led to a supposition that the virus may have mutated.\n\nBut the enterovirus hasn\u2019t been present in all those with AFM, prompting some scientists to investigate whether environmental or genetic factors might be playing a role. Messonnier said the CDC is now also exploring the possibility that the symptoms may be caused by an aberrant immune response to an infection rather than the infection itself.\n\nSome researchers also think that another virus might be a contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible and maybe likely that there may be other enteroviruses that are causing similar symptoms,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBy the time the symptoms appear, those infected might already have rid their bodies of the virus. Or, as Messonnier said, a pathogen may be hiding undetected in the body.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough disease,\u201d Osterholm said, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t fit a model of strict cause and effect.\u201d\n\nOsterholm isn\u2019t convinced that a retreat in public health funding has hampered progress in the case of AFM. Public health departments at all levels, he said, are used to dropping everything to meet new public health menaces when they must.\n\n\u201cPublic health just takes on more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of dropping major efforts.\u201d He added, however, that \u201csuch a system can\u2019t go on forever.\u201d\n\nJohn Auerbach, president and CEO of the Trust for America\u2019s Health, thinks insufficient funding is already consequential. While he pointed out that Congress eventually came up with additional funding to deal with outbreaks of Ebola and Zika in recent years, the money was not ongoing.\n\nWhen the money runs out, he said, experts in diseases such as Ebola and Zika, including epidemiologists and laboratory staff, often are laid off, removing the very people who could best prevent future outbreaks.\n\n\u201cWe know when permanent personnel are well trained in preparedness, they are able to anticipate a risk and take action before a crisis occurs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there aren\u2019t enough personnel, then you end up only being able to respond to an emergency, rather than prevent its appearance or reduce its impact.\u201d\n\nAs it is, he said, many health agencies can\u2019t do an adequate job to increase the rate of vaccinations or to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, both of which would contribute greatly to reducing diseases, such as Zika and perhaps AFM, in the country, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery health department would say, \u2018Yes, we could do more, but only if we had the resources,\u2019\u201d Auerbach said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Executive Sheryl Sandberg Calls Explosive NYT Report 'Simply Untrue'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-new-york-times-facebook-report_us_5bee3e55e4b0510a1f2f524d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 19:02:20", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cI\u2019ve said many times before that we were too slow to spot Russian interference and we certainly stumbled along the way,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a press conference, \u201cbut to suggest we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth or wanted to hide what we knew or wanted to prevent investigations is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nThe platform also issued a separate statement on its blog Wednesday, announcing that it had severed ties with Definers.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf \u2015 or to spread misinformation,\u201d Facebook wrote. \u201cDefiners did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of \u2018Freedom from Facebook,\u2019 an anti-Facebook organization.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "C.I.A.
