William McRaven, the leader of the Navy Seal unit that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011, who also has leveled sharp criticism at the President. Trump called the four-star admiral \"a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer\" and said it would \"have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that.\"\n\n\"The President is simply wrong,\" McChrystal told CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"Newsroom.\" \"He's uninformed, and he is pushing an idea that I think is not helpful.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nWe're facing a leadership crisis in America.\n\nWe've become increasingly obsessed with what national leader we're for or against. President Trump is just the most bombastic example of this phenomenon, which has been playing out for decades. Our affiliation, or opposition, to a particular leader (and especially our current leader) is the closest thing we have to a common experience.\n\nOur crisis in leadership, then, is that we're far too focused on leaders at the expense of focusing on more fundamental things, like our communities and institutions. We've reached a point where leaders set the terms for how we see the world, rather than us setting the terms for how leaders should serve us. Whether we support or oppose President Trump, when we place him \u2014 or any leader \u2014 at the center of our lives, we're ultimately ceding power.\n\nWhile this is, in part, a political phenomenon, it has roots in our biology. In his book Behave , neuroendocrinologist Robert Sapolsky points out that conformity and nonconformity are two of the most powerful drivers in human cognitive processing. We often shape our conformity or non-conformity relative to a source of authority. In plain speak: Leaders are helpful because they frame our decisions for us. From complexity, they offer simple choices.\n\nIt's easy to fall into the trap of leader-centrism, then, because it makes things easier. And that's occasionally fine, as far as our individual lives go. But it's not a recipe for forging the type of consensus required to move forward as a nation.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: Trump keeps insulting military members", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/jJXLl5q4lbo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) For a president who professes to revere the US military more than any of his predecessors, Donald Trump gets entangled in a lot of scrapes that raise doubts about the sincerity of his admiration.\n\nHe has feuded with war heroes and the relatives of fallen soldiers, sparked controversy by ducking remembrance observances and been accused of using the troops to advance his political goals. He's said he knows more about ISIS than the generals do.\n\nThe President's latest spat with an admired military figure i s with retired Adm. William McRaven, the architect of the daring special forces raid into Pakistan that killed al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in 2011, acting on CIA intelligence.\n\nThis controversy, like the President's past run-ins with military heroes, was set off by Trump's perception that he was being unfairly attacked, apparently by a politically motivated critic.\n\nWhen asked on Fox News Sunday about McRaven's warnings that Trump's claim that the media is the enemy of the people endangered democracy, the President lashed out, accusing McRaven of being a Clinton backer and in the camp of former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Of course, we should have captured Osama bin Laden long before we did,\" Trump said, dumping on the military planners behind one of the most dangerous and audacious special forces operations in recent military history.\n\nHis response was characteristic for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it reflected his obsession with his predecessor and apparent belief that anyone who worked in a past administration -- even as a nonpartisan military officer -- is somehow suspect.\n\nSecond, it underlined how the President sees almost every issue through a prism of how it affects his image and prestige. Trump's first instinct when criticized is not to move on or shrug it off, even in deference to a great soldier's sacrifice, but to see the critique as a motivated by political animosity.\n\nThe episode is a reminder of how the President tramples protocols as a matter of course in his normal daily rituals. The idea that any other recent commander in chief would take a shot at a military hero like McRaven, who is respected across partisan lines in Washington, is unthinkable.\n\nThe clash also shows that when the President thinks he has been attacked -- by McRaven, a senior former intelligence chief, or a former prisoner of war like the late Sen. John McCain -- nothing is off limits.\n\n'Appalling and disgusting'\n\nFor someone like McRaven, who spent a long career serving presidents of both parties and stifling partisan impulses, Trump's tongue lashing must have come as a harsh blow -- even though he himself had criticized the President.\n\n\"The President shifted from the question, which was about freedom of the press, to insulting a retired four-star,\" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who is a CNN military analyst.\n\n\"It was just really appalling and disgusting that the President would describe him in that way,\" Hertling said on CNN.\n\nMcRaven made clear in a statement to CNN that he had not backed Clinton in 2016, though he said he did admire the leadership of Obama and former President George W. Bush, whom he also served in a senior role.\n\nWhile Trump's words may strike many people as inappropriate, he had learned early in the 2016 Republican primary that he does not pay a political price for such comments.\n\nMany political observers predicted that Trump's attack on McCain, who he said was not a war hero because the then-Navy pilot had been captured in Vietnam, would spell the end of his White House hopes. But instead Trump went from strength to strength.\n\nSimilarly, his insults thrown at the parents of slain Muslim US soldier Humayun Khan, who had criticized him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention two years ago, did not stall his White House run.\n\nIn a sign of how times have changed, the official GOP Twitter account, which in a past era might have been looked to for unquestioning support of a military hero, on Monday endorsed Trump's comments about McRaven.\n\nIn a tweet, the Republican Party said McRaven had been on Clinton's shortlist for vice president in 2016 and had been critical of the President.\n\n\"He's hardly a non-political figure,\" the tweet said.\n\nA more difficult question is whether the President's behavior is damaging his credibility as the commander in chief, who at any moment could be charged with sending troops to fight, and possibly die, in a national crisis.\n\nLeon Panetta, the CIA director and defense secretary under Obama, issued a strongly worded statement putting that issue in play on Monday.\n\n\"The President's statement criticizing McRaven for not getting Bin Laden sooner is patently ridiculous,\" Panetta said. \"It demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of how our military and intelligence agencies operate, and undermines the President's own standing as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nGiven that the military is required by tradition and constitutional role to fall in behind the nation's civilian leadership, there is unlikely to be any public condemnation of Trump's criticism from serving officers.\n\nFormer officers often seek to avoid being publicly drawn into the fray too, though they are more free to hint at feelings percolating inside the military.\n\nRetired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who lost his job as commander of US forces in Afghanistan after he and some of his colleagues were quoted mocking Vice President Joe Biden and other civilian officials in 2010, said on CNN's \"Newsroom\" on Monday that soldiers in the field need confidence in their commander in chief and what he stands for.\n\n\"We have certain things we want and demand of leaders,\" McChrystal said.\n\n\"And to a degree, there has to be a confidence in the leader's basic core values. We have to be able to believe in enough of what that leader represents to feel comfortable following them, sometimes to our deaths.\"\n\nAwkward moments\n\nThe controversy with McRaven, Trump's criticism of Khan's parents and his swipes at McCain are not the only awkward moments he has had as commander in chief. He was accused of not being sufficiently sympathetic in a 2017 telephone call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who had been killed in action in Niger.\n\nHis recent order of troops to the southern US border to deal with a migrant caravan that has yet to arrive has been blasted as a political stunt by critics. Earlier this month, Trump did not attend a ceremony honoring US troops killed in World War I outside Paris, citing the poor weather that had grounded his helicopter. He said in the Fox News interview that he should have gone to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day when he returned. He has also yet to visit troops in a war zone, as his predecessors often did around national holidays like Thanksgiving. But he did attend the transfer of the remains of a service member killed in Yemen early in his presidency.\n\nTrump frequently argues that no one has been more pro-military than he, and claims to have pulled the nation's armed forces out of a funding crisis.\n\nAnd in many ways, he has honored his promises to be pro-military.\n\nHe secured a massive $700 billion spending bill that will mean new fleets of ships, planes, submarines, missiles and helicopters and the largest pay increase for military personnel in eight years, though his claim that it is the first wage hike for the troops in a decade is false.\n\nTrump's affection for the military is emotional and political. He seems to see the troops as embodying qualities of power and masculinity he admires.\n\nIt's no coincidence that he has packed his administration with former generals. To hear him tell it, it often seemed as though he picked Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary because of his nickname, \"Mad Dog.\"\n\nTrump has often lauded hard-charging World War II Gen. George Patton as a hero. It may be no coincidence that the classic Hollywood biopic about the war hero opens with a rasping speech from star George C. Scott, who delivers an almost Trumpian monologue before a huge American flag.\n\n\"Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser,\" Scott says.\n\nTrump attended New York Military Academy as a young man, where he was taught, according to biographer Michael D'Antonio, that \"life is about survival\" and he showed on the sports field that he would do anything to win."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Are the wheels coming off China's Belt and Road megaproject?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/arRZffxhwbc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Hong Kong (CNN) Kenya is the latest country where China is frantically defusing a public relations storm over President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road megaproject .\n\nIn a statement Friday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed as \"not true\" numerous reports that a key port in Mombasa was at risk of being seized by Beijing over unpaid debts.\n\n\"The Chinese government themselves say this (it) is nonsense,\" Kenyatta said, while the AG's office denied publishing any such letter, copies of which circulated widely online.\n\nDespite Beijing and Nairobi's vehement denials, concerns over the loans speak to a growing fear in many developing countries that their governments, in rushing to cash in on China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), have left themselves overextended, with Chinese state-owned companies ready to snap up ports, railways and other key infrastructure across the globe should debtors default.\n\nFive years into the BRI, the sheen is also coming off the project in Beijing, amid an ongoing -- though temporarily paused -- trade war with the US, and concerns over future funding and returns on an increasingly unwieldy list of overseas investments.\n\nDebt fears\n\nFor critics of the BRI, Sri Lanka's Hambantota port is the perfect example of the risks developing countries are taking on with their Chinese loans.\n\nIn December 2017, Beijing acquired a 99-year lease to the port -- located in a key strategic position on the Indian Ocean -- in return for forgiving some of the billions of dollars the South Asian country owed China.\n\nThe move sparked fears China would use similar defaults in other countries to acquire a host of new infrastructure, with both potential economic and military benefits -- leapfrogging rivals in the region such as India and the US.\n\nIn mid-2018, the Zambian government had to deny reports it was preparing to hand over control of multiple public assets, including the state broadcaster and Lusaka's Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, to China.\n\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta (left) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the welcome ceremony for the Belt and Road Forum, near Beijing in May 2017.\n\nKenya's own issues date to 2014, when Nairobi signed a multi-billion-dollar deal with the state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation to fund a new rail link between the Kenyan capital and Mombasa, on the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe train line, known in Kenya as the standard gauge railway (SGR) project, was completed in 2017, slashing the transport time between the country's two largest cities. It is now in its second phase, with the Kenyan government reportedly borrowing a further $1.6 billion from China to fund a line from Nairobi to Naivasha.\n\nBut while the SGR has been a boon to residents of Nairobi and Mombasa, it has yet to generate half the revenues anticipated in feasibility studies, according to The East African newspaper -- raising fears over the country's ability to repay the loan. It has also been criticized for being vastly overpriced, reportedly costing about three times the international standard.\n\nRepayments are due to start in mid-2019, when a five-year grace period expires. On Friday, Kenyatta insisted that \"we are ahead of our payment schedule.\"\n\n\"We are not tied to any country,\" he added.\n\n'Land grab'\n\nIn the first half of 2018, Chinese companies provided overseas loans of about $50 billion, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), adding to the more than $8 trillion of investment previously announced.\n\nHowever, that figure was down on the same period the year before as concerns grew over the BRI both overseas and back in China.\n\n\"(Late 2018) saw a number of high-profile projects suspended ( including in Malaysia ) or scaled back ( including in Myanmar ) amid growing concerns over debt sustainability and transparency,\" the EIU report said.\n\nMany countries that were initially willing to take Beijing's money have expressed concern over what could happen should they default on debt payments, particularly after the Sri Lanka deal.\n\nPart of the problem stems from Beijing's \"ad hoc approach\" to settling debt issues, according to a report by the Center for Global Development (CDG), which pointed to a lack of consistency in dealing with defaulting nations. In the past, China has been willing to write off or restructure debts and extend further lines of credit, while at other times it has demanded assets to service the loans.\n\n\"Without a guiding multilateral or other framework to define China's approach to debt sustainability problems, we only have anecdotal evidence of ad hoc actions taken by China as the basis for characterizing the country's policy approach,\" the CDG report said.\n\nThis creates significant uncertainty, and forces governments borrowing from China to rely on maintaining strong bilateral ties above all else to ensure future lending policies.\n\nA rail link between the Kenyan cities of Mombasa and Nairobi has been a boon to passengers, but critics say it cost too much and leaves the country exposed to China.\n\nAfrican leaders heaped praise on President Xi after the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing in September, with Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi telling state media \"we admire and hold you in very high regard! Keep the innovation, friendliness and international outlook as bright as the Chinese spirit!\"\n\n\"Your friends in Botswana wish the very best for a successful One China!\" he added, an apparent reference to Beijing's policy regarding Taiwan, a key element in its approach to Africa, where numerous countries have dropped diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing in recent years\n\nElsewhere, however, concerns and uncertainty over the BRI have sparked a backlash against China -- particularly in the Maldives and Malaysia, where opposition parties critical of Beijing have recently taken power.\n\nIn January 2018, former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed accused Beijing of staging a \"land grab\" in his country. After his Maldivian Democratic Party took power this November, it pledged to end \"China's colonialism\" and renegotiate loans agreed by former strongman Abdulla Yameen with Beijing.\n\nIn August, recently elected Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad shelved two Chinese-funded projects over fears they could \"bankrupt\" the country.\n\nChina has vigorously pushed back against such criticism, saying it is subjected to a double standard.\n\n\"It is unreasonable that money coming out of Western countries is praised as good and sweet, while coming out of China it's sinister and a trap,\" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in September\n\nFork in the road\n\nWhile the loudest criticism of the Belt and Road Initiative has come from overseas, there are also growing doubts over the project within China.\n\nSince the BRI was launched , critics have warned the scheme could leave China overextended, with billions of dollars wasted on projects that never pay off. While Beijing may acquire control of certain projects in return for forgiving debts, any strategic wins could be outweighed by a host of white elephant investments that offer little benefit to China.\n\nrecent survey conducting by Peking University and the Beijing-based Taihe Insitute found that nearly half of 100 countries evaluated were not a good fit for BRI projects due to weaknesses in financing and infrastructure, adding that the government should \"assess and prevent the risks\" before pushing ahead with them.\n\nThe BRI is also facing pressure from Washington -- despite the temporarily paused trade war -- and other rival nations keen to restrain China from supplanting their influence over developing countries, as well as a potential funding shortfall for future projects.\n\nWhile boosters for the BRI remain plentiful, and the project is not on the verge of failing any time soon, there are signs that a shift is underway. The number of contracts signed in 2018 was down on previous years, and country's big development banks have reportedly been told to partner with the World Bank and other international lenders on future projects.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative was supposed to be Xi's signature project, one that would drive China back to its traditional position of power and dominance both in Asia and wider afield."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Kim Jong Un: Nuclear tyrant or global statesman?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/UV5b7oUfsgc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Kim Jong Un shocked the world in 2018 by transforming his image from nuclear-armed tyrant to global statesman.\n\nSo what does he have up his sleeve for 2019?\n\nAnalysts believe that key clues will emerge during his annual New Year's Day speech -- essentially North Korea's version of the State of the Union in the United States.\n\nExperts will be watching for any mention of a second summit with US President Donald Trump or anything on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. Kim could also reveal key decisions on economic policy and inter-Korean relations.\n\nIn a sign of his new diplomatic push, Kim sent a letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday. In it, Kim said he regretted not being able to visit Seoul in 2018 but expressed a strong will to travel to the South Korean capital in the future.\n\nFew expect Kim to rock the boat dramatically in Tuesday's speech. Many believe the young leader holds some of the best cards of all the geopolitical players with a stake in the future of the Korean Peninsula. Most do not expect Kim to risk his standing in a speech that's largely intended for a domestic audience.\n\n\"He's got the United States and South Korea where they want them right now,\" said Evans Revere, a former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and current senior director with the Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nNorth Korea's diplomatic achievements in 2018 would have been unthinkable a year earlier. In the lead up to Kim's 2018 New Year's speech, Pyongyang had tested its most advanced long-range missile to date and its most powerful nuclear bomb, after months of similar weapons tests and saber-rattling between North Korea and the US.\n\nFew would have predicted that the following year, Kim would meet Moon three times, leave his country for the first time since taking power in 2011 and become the first North Korean leader to sit face to face with a sitting US President.\n\nJUST WATCHED South Korean train heads North for first time in decade Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH South Korean train heads North for first time in decade 01:13\n\nThat dramatic shift began with the New Year's address. Kim spoke warmly of the importance of inter-Korean relations, and wished his South Korean compatriots well in hosting the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Moon would go on to seize Kim's olive branch as an opportunity to jumpstart cross-border relations.\n\n\"It was a seminal, critical and central document in terms of understanding North Korea's game plan and North Korea's intentions,\" Revere said.\n\n\"I've never seen a game plan more transparently laid out than it was laid out in that speech.\"\n\nNuclear weapons\n\nKim kicked off the last two years with speeches that broke news, revealed major policy decisions and dropped rhetorical hints as to what the rest of the world should expect from his country in the coming year.\n\nIn 2017 he used the speech to say his country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) -- the type necessary to delivery a nuclear weapon to the continental US. Pyongyang went on to test three ICBMs that year.\n\nJUST WATCHED Kim Jong Un's 2018 New Year's address Replay More Videos ...

The two leaders agreed to start rebuilding the bilateral relationship and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. In terms of nuclear weapons, North Korea committed \"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" a vague term that experts say Washington and Pyongyang interpret differently.\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea expert says nuclear threat remains Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea expert says nuclear threat remains 11:43\n\nCritics accuse the Trump administration of failing to get Pyongyang to sign on to anything specific. North Korea has not agreed to any timeline to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nor has it committed itself to declaring its weaponry and key weapons facilities -- steps that experts say are crucial in any disarmament talks.\n\nExperts will be watching for any mention of the nuclear program in next year's speech, especially if it strikes the defiant tone of this year's address -- when Kim declared that \"no force and nothing\" could reverse the gains his country had made in nuclear weapons development.\n\n\"He said that this January, but he's engaged in this diplomatic process with the US,\" said Duyeon Kim, a adjunct fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see how Pyongyang negotiates going forward because Kim Jong Un claimed this year that nobody could reverse their nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nEconomics\n\nClues about what Pyongyang sees as the speech's key passages often come in the form of rhetorical devices, such as when Kim switches to a first-person voice, according to John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Affairs in Seoul.\n\nDelury said he'll watch closely for comments about the country's economic development, something likely to be highly scrutinized inside North Korea and which could prove to be the most important part of the speech.\n\nIn the 2018 speech, Kim acknowledged that the moribund economy was in need of a boost and committed himself to improving it. However North Korea does not make its economic statistics available internationally, making it difficult to precisely track its economic performance and determine what proportion of its population works in more modern fields.\n\nJust days before his first summit with Moon in April , Kim took the drastic step of declaring that North Korea had successfully completed its nuclear weapons program and would suspend nuclear and missile tests. It would now solely focus on effort to \"dramatically raise people's lives\" by developing a \"strong socialist economy.\"\n\nThe two-pronged strategy of nuclear and economic development, known as \"byungjin,\" had been in place since shortly after Kim took the reins from his father in 2011. Abandoning it represented a significant policy shift.\n\nHowever, the regime has yet to articulate a coherent vision or plan with respect to development.\n\n\"There's some pressure in this year's New Year's speech to articulate a vision of a real focus on economic development,\" Delury said.\n\n\"How does Kim Jong Un reflect this strategic shift to economic development?\"\n\nIn recent months, North Korean state media has focused heavily on economic issues, often touting the importance that people inside the country work vigorously to increase production.\n\nBut that hardly constitutes a plan. Investors see North Korea as a land ripe with opportunities, and they're looking for a strategy that would allow for infrastructure investments connecting South Korea to Russia by rail or opening up North Korea's relatively well-educated, low-wage workforce to manufacturers from the region.\n\nAll of that, however, is off-limits at the moment due to the sanctions levied on Pyongyang as punishment for its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd Delury says it's unlikely for Kim to come out and just announce a detailed strategic shift.

Beijing has begun pushing for a greater stake in the region with a view to opening new trade routes, exploring for oil and gas and conducting research on climate change, experts say.\n\nGeographically, China is nowhere near the Arctic Circle, which puts the Asian powerhouse at a major political disadvantage compared to eight countries that make up the Arctic Council, all of whom have territory inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nCouncil members are divided on China's growing interest in the region. Some smaller economies like Iceland and Norway see an opportunity, others with a strategic interest like Russia and Canada are growing wary.\n\nChina isn't the only non-Arctic state interested in the region but it is by far the biggest, China and polar region expert Marc Lanteigne of Massey University in New Zealand told CNN.\n\nIn 2013 it joined India, South Korea, Japan and Singapore in gaining non-voting observer status on the Council.\n\n\"Overall, there's been the acceptance that China is going to be a player there, but there is still some concern about the ambiguity to what China's endgame is,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nArctic Council foreign ministers with then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on May 11, 2017.\n\nPolar silk road\n\nIn January, Beijing published its first Arctic strategy white paper, claiming a vested interest in the region while attempting to allay fears over its territorial ambitions.\n\nIt defines itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in the document, saying environmental changes in the Arctic have a \"direct impact on China's climate system and ecological environment.\"\n\nThe white paper details Beijing's plans for a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure program, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping whose government has spent big to build vast trade corridors across the world.\n\nWhile the Belt and Road initiative has drawn criticism in the West due to concerns that China is ensnaring developing countries in debt, Lanteigne says it's welcomed by some of the smaller Arctic players keen on building economic ties with Beijing.\n\n\"It has excited quite a few of the Nordic states who see the possibility of expanded Chinese sea traffic and potentially new ports,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nThe idea of a mutually beneficial partnership is exactly the reassuring message China sought to drive home in its Arctic policy, with repeated references to \"cooperation.\"\n\nMelting sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast on March 30, 2017 above Greenland.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to Arctic Council concerns before China's admission, when members feared it could seek to repeat its South China Sea territorial grab in the Arctic Circle.\n\nBeijing claims an enormous swath of territory in the South China Sea, and has created heavily fortified artificial islands to help assert its position in the Spratly and Paracel island chains.\n\nIn comparison, the situation in the Arctic is relatively peaceful, according to experts, with no serious territorial disputes. And the Arctic states are eager to keep it that way.\n\n'Brimming with economic potential'\n\nBeijing claims the main reason for its interest in the Arctic is scientific research.\n\nIn the white paper, it detailed a desire to investigate the effects of climate change to \"resolve global environmental issues.\"\n\nBut skeptics have argued that China's Arctic ambitions are largely fueled by the economic and political appeal of dominating a resource-rich area.\n\nIt is estimated that the Arctic may hold nearly one-third of the world's natural gas and 13% of global oil reserves, according to a report by Rachael Gosnell at the University of Maryland.\n\nAnd as rising temperatures melt the region's ice, shipping routes that were once impassible are now an attractive and feasible alternative for the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The Arctic is brimming with economic potential,\" said Gosnell, who estimates that the annual economy of the region exceeds $450 billion.\n\nAccording to NASA, some global climate models predict the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months by the middle of this century, likely making its waters an important shipping route.\n\n\"China really wants to put itself in a position whereby, should there be some kind of scramble or push for Arctic resources, China would be very well placed to take advantage of that,\" said Lanteigne, the polar region expert.\n\nTo secure that position, it is strengthening its Arctic capabilities. In September, China launched a second icebreaker known as Xue Long 2, or Snow Dragon 2, with an expedition scheduled for the first half of 2019, according to state-run media.\n\nThe newly minted vessel is the first Chinese-built icebreaker. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation claims it will be more capable of cutting through ice and carrying out advanced research than its foreign-built predecessor.\n\nChina's first domestically-built icebreaker, Xuelong 2, during a launch ceremony at a shipyard in Shanghai in September.\n\nWashington's loss, Beijing's gain\n\nChina has been quick to recognize the importance of investing in the Arctic at a time when there are few participants and even fewer laws, so that it can eventually restructure Arctic governance in its favor, said Harriet Moynihan, associate fellow at the UK think tank Chatham House.\n\nChina's increasing involvement in the Arctic Circle has also coincided with a growing lack of interest from Washington.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to eliminate a special envoy and representative for the Arctic region in 2017, as climate change dropped down the list of priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet. In 2018 only two functioning icebreakers remain, one of which is a heavy-duty vessel overdue for an update.\n\nThe Obama administration pursued an ambitious Arctic strategy to ensure the US remained a strong power in regional affairs, including plans to replace the heavy icebreaker by 2020.\n\nBut it's unclear where the US now stands on those plans. The US Coast Guard, which runs the icebreakers, faces significant budget cuts as more and more funding is reconsidered for border security.\n\n\"Because of the fact that the Arctic is not a priority for the Trump government, this has allowed China to take the steering wheel and accelerate their own Arctic policies,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nRussia is arguably the most active Arctic state, with a fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, and it is reluctant to allow non-Arctic countries to develop the region.\n\nBut facing mounting Western sanctions, Moscow's attitude toward China has warmed considerably. \"Russia realized that China was one of the few countries left that could really help with Siberian development,\" Lanteigne said.\n\n\"The two countries have cooperated in a number of Arctic ventures, including a liquefied natural gas project.\"\n\nWith large parts of the Arctic still difficult for China to reach, it remains less important to Beijing than investments in other parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia.\n\nBut China's presence in the far north is only likely to grow -- whether the Arctic states are pleased about it or not."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "From paychecks to pups: Get ready for new laws in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/b4HCliszX6E/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) When the New Year's confetti comes down at midnight, so will a wave of new laws across the country.\n\nFrom jury duty to pet purchases, here's a look at some of the changes for 2019:\n\nMinimum wages will get a boost\n\nAt least 19 states will increase their minimum wages on or around New Year's Day, according to the National Employment Law Project\n\nThe group's executive director, Christine Owens, said the increases come after years of frustration by hard-working, lower-income Americans.\n\n\"Working people are struggling to pay their bills, but they see that it's the corporations and the wealthy CEOs who are getting the tax breaks.

He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of solicitation to commit murder in the first degree, District Attorney Dan May said.\n\nProsecutors filed two murder charges because they have different theories. One is that he acted alone to kill Berreth, the other says he alone or with other people killed her during a robbery.\n\nThe three solicitation charges refer to soliciting the murder in three separate incidents. It could mean he allegedly solicited the same person three times or three people on different occasions.\n\nFrazee's arrest came almost a month after Berreth vanished on Thanksgiving near Woodland Park, a city between Denver and Colorado Springs.\n\nAuthorities do not believe Berreth is alive, but they have not found her body. They have not determined a motive.\n\nFrazee is being held without bond. A bond hearing is scheduled for January 29. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.\n\nFrazee told police he last saw Berreth on November 22, when he picked up their daughter, making him the last known person to report seeing her alive.\n\nBerreth's employer got a text from her phone on November 25, saying she wouldn't be able to work that week, police said. Frazee said she texted him that day, but the contents of that text haven't been released.\n\nThat same day, Berreth's phone was tracked to a location near Gooding, Idaho, Woodland Park Police Chief Miles De Young previously said. Gooding is roughly 800 miles northwest of Woodland Park.\n\n\"She's not the kind that runs off,\" Cheryl Berreth, Kelsey's mother, said in a December 10 press conference. \"This is completely out of character.

Within months, Berreth moved to Colorado to be with Frazee, said Garreston, who never met Frazee.\n\nFrazee has a business shoeing horses in Teller County. Several of Frazee's friends and clients told CNN that he was well known and liked in the community and was a good father to daughter Kaylee.\n\nTwo friends said Frazee told them that the relationship with Berreth ended months ago -- claims that contradict statements from Berreth's aunt, who wrote on Facebook that Berreth broke up with Frazee the same day she went missing.\n\n\"I still refuse to believe that he's done this until I see the evidence,\" said Tamra Freeman, whose granddaughter played with Frazee's daughter.\n\nFreeman said that Frazee told her the relationship with Berreth ended on New Year's Day 2018, and the only contact they had was related to their daughter. Berreth's mother has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nFrazee was at Freeman's home two days before his arrest, she said. She recalls him being concerned about what would happen to Kaylee if he was arrested, she said. Freeman said Frazee told her he felt \"railroaded\" by police, who he claimed seemed to be focused only on him.\n\nWhen asked if others were investigated as potential suspects, District Attorney Dan May declined to share specifics of the investigation.\n\nLevi Snare said he went through 4H with Frazee when they were children, and he leases a bull from Frazee for his cows.

William McRaven, the leader of the Navy Seal unit that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011, who also has leveled sharp criticism at the President. Trump called the four-star admiral \"a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer\" and said it would \"have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that.\"\n\n\"The President is simply wrong,\" McChrystal told CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"Newsroom.\" \"He's uninformed, and he is pushing an idea that I think is not helpful. But I really think its symptomatic of the crisis in leadership that we have in the nation today.\"\n\nMcChrystal wrote in a November column for CNN that \"America is facing a leadership crisis,\" calling Trump \"just the most bombastic example of this phenomenon, which has been playing out for decades.\"\n\nIn his Sunday interview, McChrystal also reacted to James Mattis' resignation from the Trump administration as secretary of defense earlier this month. Mattis wrote in his resignation letter that Trump had the right to have a Defense Secretary whose views \"better aligned\" with the President's.\n\n\"If we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis, resigns his position walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say okay, why did he do it?\" McChrystal said. \"We ought to ask what kind of commander in chief he had that Jim Mattis that the good marine felt he had to walk away.\"\n\nMcChrystal led US forces in Afghanistan under President Barack Obama, but resigned in 2010 over comments he and his top officers made in a Rolling Stone article that belittled other administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden.

Elizabeth Warren's announcement in the dying hours of 2018 that she is launching an exploratory committee -- the first step toward a campaign for the party's nomination.\n\nThere was an ominous feel to the holidays given the dark cloud hanging over Trump because of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose findings could take the nation down the bitter road to impeachment in the year to come.\n\nBut the President doesn't just have to worry about Mueller. Democrats are days away from taking control of the House of Representatives and inaugurating a novel challenge for Trump's presidency -- congressional oversight.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 265 points to close 2018, in a sleepy session compared to the stomach-wchurning instability that produced the worst year for stocks in a decade and could fuel economic uncertainty that could play into the 2020 race.\n\nAnd as always, there are signs of instability and chaos in the White House, with confusion over Trump's exact position on a border wall and his planned Syria troop withdrawal, while key staff vacancies were unfilled.\n\nShutting government to please the base\n\nTrump stayed at home, often largely alone in the White House over the Christmas and New Year's break, tweeting at Democrats but with no real political movement evident over the shutdown. Often the aim seemed to be to talk solely to his political base -- a trend that is likely to go on all year.\n\n\"I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!\" Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon.\n\nIt's unclear how Trump plans to get out of the partial shutdown that has hit hundreds of thousands of federal workers, since Democrats are disinclined to grant funding for his border wall.\n\nHe could have avoided the shutdown altogether had he agreed to sign on to a stopgap measure that passed the Senate last month and would have kept government open in the short term, but would not have funded the wall.\n\nBut the President backtracked under pressure from conservatives in the House and right-wing media commentators like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nSo to climb down now would risk similar condemnation and the possibility of a weakening of support among base voters on whom he depends for political viability, given his decision not to try to broaden his 2016 coalition.\n\nWith a weak but stable political standing -- between 40% and 45% approve of the job he's doing in most polls -- the President clearly understands that he needs to engineer a series of base-pleasing fights this year to keep his political foundation intact.\n\nBut as Democrats take over the House, they have little incentive to bail the President out -- at least until there is evidence that his tactic of branding them weak on border security is causing them political damage.\n\nAfter all, Trump won election by saying Mexico, not US taxpayers, would pay for the wall. And he said he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall in a notorious Oval Office clash with Democratic leaders.\n\nThe next move in the saga will come later in the week, when Democrats put the ball back in the Republican court.\n\nThe soon-to-be Democrat-controlled House is expected to vote on six Senate spending bills and a stopgap measure to reopen the Homeland Security Department at its current funding levels until February 8, a Democratic aide told CNN Monday.\n\nAlthough the temporary measure would maintain the current $1.3 billion in border security money, Senate GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't move any legislation until Trump signs off.\n\nSo both sides are staring at a dead end.\n\nThe calendar says 2019 -- but it's already 2020\n\nWarren took the first plunge of the front-running Democratic pack, giving her a head start on the first quarter fundraising race that will be used to assess the viability of the top contenders. She is likely to find the field crowded very soon.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator carved out populist economic ground with her opening message, stressing her humble roots and wholesome family background and accusing billionaires and corporations of attacking the middle class.\n\nWarren's strengths include long crusades against big banks and Wall Street titans, as Democrats seek a candidate that can loosen Trump's hold on working-class voters in the industrial Midwest in 2020.\n\n\"Corruption is poisoning our democracy,\" Warren said in a web video filmed in her kitchen, and then hit out at \"bigotry and fear\" in a sidelong reference to Trump.\n\nPundits are already questioning, however, whether Warren has missed her moment, will be viewed as too old at 69, or will be seen as too white at a time when a youthful and ethnic transformation is taking place in the Democratic Party.\n\nHer effort to defuse Trump's attacks over her claims to Native American heritage last year with a DNA test was widely seen as botched and damaging to her candidacy by Beltway insiders.\n\nStill, Warren has a jump on other rivals, possibly including California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe stirring Democratic race will also give Trump something he has long lacked, but loves -- a new enemy that he can use to define his own re-election bid and a genuine opening onto the campaign trail, where he excels.\n\nThe jockeying for position among Democrats and how the candidates respond to withering fire from Trump will define the first year of the 2020 campaign.\n\nIt's always Mueller time\n\nA reminder of where we were before the holiday.\n\nTrump's campaign, transition, inaugural committee and presidency are under active investigation. So are his business, the Trump Organization, and his defunct charity, the Trump Foundation. The President was indirectly implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws.\n\nPredictions that Mueller would wrap up his investigation into alleged election collusion with Russia and possible presidential obstruction of justice by the end of 2018 turned out to be wide of the mark.\n\nBut every week that went by late last year brought more bad news for Trump and signs Mueller is closing in on the President following a flurry of legal filings, court moves and convictions, and guilty pleas against close Trump associates.\n\nQuestions swirl around Trump's longtime political adviser Roger Stone, about, among other things, what he knew about WikiLeaks email dumps and when he knew it. And people even closer to Trump, such as his son Don Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner, cannot be sure they are in the clear, although all, including the President, profess innocence and downplay Mueller's investigation.\n\nRising pressure on the White House may have prompted Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to escalate the effort to discredit the special counsel over the holiday.\n\n\"My ultimatum is put up or shut up, Bob,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox and Friends\" on Sunday.\n\n\"What do you have? There are those of us who believe you don't have anything on collusion,\" he continued. \"And by the way, it's not a crime. So what the heck are you doing?\"\n\nDespite such defiance, Mueller could have the most fateful impact on the political year if he concludes that Trump has something to answer for in a report that could put the entire presidency in peril.\n\nTurmoil in the West Wing\n\nThe first half of Trump's term has generated unprecedented turmoil, turnover and chaos in the West Wing. There's no reason to think that changes now.\n\nThe President enters the new year more liberated from \"adults in the room\" than ever, and freer to follow his impulses. What that means became clear late last year, with his sudden Twitter announcement of a full troop withdrawal from Syria with the words \"they are coming back now.\"\n\nThe President's willingness to follow his gut was also reflected in his lurch into a government shutdown.\n\nYet in the days since, his improvisational governing style has sparked strategic confusion about his intentions on both issues.\n\nAfter meeting the President for lunch on Sunday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared to signal that Trump was having a change of heart at least about the pace of withdrawals from Syria.\n\nOn Monday, Trump hit out at comments by his departing chief of staff, John Kelly, who had suggested in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that the concept of a concrete wall had been abandoned long ago.\n\nBut before Christmas, the President tweeted that the wall would in fact be made up of \"artistically designed steel slats\" that border agents could see through.\n\nThe confusion is yet another sign that the President's often shifting positions and goals -- which he sees as the key to keeping his foes off balance -- will mean another year of political whiplash in Washington."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The 5 House chairs who are about to make life much harder for Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ovdbzUYj138/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump will face an intensified level of scrutiny in the new year, with Democratic House committee chairs poised to comb through every corner of his administration, subpoena his Cabinet and investigate his personal finances, associates and business interests.\n\nWhile Trump has directed his political attacks at Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi , it's the committee chairs who will soon become his greatest foes.\n\nThe President -- no stranger to name calling or political swipes -- has already begun jabbing some of the incoming chairs on Twitter over the past two years, and he has decades of history with one of the new leaders. But despite Trump's declarations that he's prepared to play hardball with the Democratic investigators, there's a new crew of Democrats in Washington -- rising from the party's return to the majority in the House of Representatives -- who have subpoena power and are prepared to use it.\n\n\"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, speaks at an event in October 2014 in New York City. Nadler will lead the House Judiciary Committee next year. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nJerry Nadler\n\nTrump's history with Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York dates to the 1980s, when they battled over Manhattan real estate while Nadler was in the New York State Assembly before he was elected to Congress. In his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump called Nadler \"one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.\"\n\n\"This guy wanted to put a railroad yard on the same property where I wanted to build a park and create the best middle-income housing in New York,\" Trump wrote in his book.\n\nNow Nadler is set to lead the Judiciary Committee, which would put him i n charge of any Democratic impeachment effort. His committee will also be in charge of handling a report from special counsel Robert Mueller and any fights that may arise about making it public.\n\nNadler's committee also has jurisdiction over Trump's signature issue: immigration, an area Nadler is poised to conduct rigorous oversight on -- from family separation to changes to asylum laws -- in the new Congress.\n\nNadler has said it's too soon to talk impeachment , even though there's a sizable chunk of Democratic advocates -- not to mention some House lawmakers -- who already want to move forward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nadler: Impeachable offense doesn't mean impeachment Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nadler: Impeachable offense doesn't mean impeachment 04:40\n\nThat doesn't mean Nadler has avoided the \"I\" word altogether.\n\nAsked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" earlier this month about Trump being implicated i n Michael Cohen's crimes of paying women for their silence during the campaign , Nadler said: \"They would be impeachable offenses.\"\n\nBut he said pursing impeachment is a different question.\n\n\"You don't necessarily launch an impeachment against the President because he committed an impeachable offense,\" Nadler said. \"There are several things you have to look at.\"\n\nIf Democrats do to try to impeach Trump, Nadler will be one of the most important Democrats in the caucus -- and will likely face the breadth of Trump's backlash.\n\nRep.

Schiff is expected to chair the House Intelligence Committee starting in January. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAdam Schiff\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is no stranger to Trump's Twitter tongue lashings . As the top Democrat on the Republican-led House Russia investigation in 2017 and 2018, Schiff was a constant television presence breaking down the newest revelations about Russia and Trump's team.\n\nThe President has used multiple nicknames on Twitter for the California Democrat -- Sleazy Adam Schiff, Liddle' Adam Schiff and most recently \"little Adam Schitt\" -- a sign of his prominence among Trump's Democratic critics.\n\nSchiff has accused Republicans of failing to investigate the ties between Trump's team and Russia, and he's promised to restart his committee's Russia investigation in several areas.\n\nAmong them: Schiff wants to investigate questions about Russian money laundering, to learn who Donald Trump Jr. was calling as he set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and to interview officials the committee has yet to speak to, like Michael Flynn.\n\nSchiff is a soft-spoken lawmaker, but he's shown a willingness provide headline-grabbing quotes.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first President in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time,\" Schiff said earlier this month on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal criticizes the Republican tax plan during at the US Capitol in November 2017 in Washington, DC. Neal will chair the House Ways and Means Committee in January. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRichard Neal\n\nIn the new Congress it will be Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a deal-focused Democrat, who will have the job of asking for Trump's tax returns . While modern presidential nominees have publicly released their returns, Trump has defied the norm, which Democrats argue must be remedied.\n\nUnder IRS rules, there are only three people on Capitol Hill who can ask the Treasury Department for the President's tax returns: the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal is the only Democrat.\n\nWhile Neal has said he wants to ensure that requesting the returns doesn't distract from his committee's work on infrastructure, health care and oversight of the GOP's tax bill, a source close to the process told CNN that Neal has largely given up hope that Trump will turn over his tax returns willingly, given comments from the President's allies. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN that the President would be prepared to fight in court over any formal request.\n\nThe source familiar with the process told CNN that Neal is prepared to ask the Treasury Department for the returns in the new year. When exactly he would do it is still under discussion.\n\nTrump's tax returns aren't of interest just to Neal, however. Other incoming committee chairs have said the information within the returns could advance their own oversight.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what ... has been the sources of income for this President,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the expected chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nCummings continued, \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia, we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\"\n\nElijah Cummings\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the minority, Cummings has perhaps the broadest authority to investigate the Trump administration of any Democrat on Capitol Hill. Cummings -- even with his deep and focused voice -- is reserved, but strategic about the plans for his committee.\n\nA foil to Republican chairs like Rep. Darrell Issa of California, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, Cummings has argued he plans to be in search of answers, not headlines -- although with his gavel, it's unlikely he will be able to avoid them.\n\nCummings has laid out a very clear path for his committee. Earlier this month, he re-sent 51 letters he'd sent while in the minority, asking the administration to comply by January 11. The letters ranged from questions about Cabinet secretary travel to immigration to security clearances to hurricane recovery efforts by the administration. But Cummings has also warned that he doesn't want his committee to only zero in on Trump's perceived failings.\n\n\"I believe that what we do in this Congress over the next year or so will have impact for the next 50 to 100 years,\" Cummings said. \"We're going to cautiously go about with subpoenas. ... There would have to be something that has a compelling interest to the citizens of the United States, and would have to be something that comes under our jurisdiction. So there's certain criteria that has to be met. I do not expect to be issuing subpoenas -- even the 64 that we've asked for because there are so many things that are backed up. And we'll never get a chance to do everything.\"\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, looks on before speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC in January. Waters will chair the House Financial Services Committee in January.\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nRep. Maxine Waters of California was pushing for impeachment back in 2017 , and she's been among the most vocal and well-known Democrats to do so. Now she'll run the Financial Services Committee, which will give her an avenue to probe the finances of Trump and the Trump Organization.\n\nThat's also made her a target for the President, who went after Waters during the 2018 campaign in tweets and at campaign rallies as a way to fire up his base. He's also attacked Waters as a \"low IQ person,\" which she has said is a racist attack.\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\" Trump tweeted in June. \"She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nWaters has made controversial statements of her own, including her call for supporters to publicly harass members of the administration in response to Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to family separations at the border.\n\nWhile in the minority, Waters pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, a lender to Trump that was separately implicated in a Russian money laundering operation in 2017. She's also pushed the Treasury Department to divulge financial ties between Russia and the Trump family.\n\nThe jurisdiction of Waters' committee makes it likely she'll clash with Trump in a way that particularly hits home for him: his finances."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Chief Pentagon spokeswoman announces departure", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/FQITjyvn_8k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Chief Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White is leaving her post, a move that coincides with Secretary of Defense James Mattis stepping down but also comes amid an internal Defense Department investigation into her conduct.\n\n\"I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by this administration to serve alongside Secretary Mattis, our Service members and all the civilians who support them,\" White tweeted Monday. \"It has been my honor and privilege.

About four months ago, desperate to be near relatives and longing for small-town life again, they moved to Indiana.\n\nThey picked a home on about 2 acres of land, down rural country roads and tucked between cornfields. They wanted a spot to give the family space, to let the boys grow and prosper and to allow their older brother, Aza, 5, to thrive on his own.\n\nJadon plays with letters of the alphabet during a physical therapy session.\n\n\"I had reached a point where I couldn't do it anymore,\" Nicole said. \"I needed my mom.

He used a breathing machine to keep him alive and other equipment was hooked up to him to monitor his vitals.\n\nAnias faced major setbacks over the past year. He stopped rolling. He stopped playing with toys. He stopped lifting his head because so much fluid had built around his brain it weighed him down.\n\n\"It was horrific for me to watch,\" Nicole says. Anias had not \"just stopped development, but regressed in development.\"\n\nHe also developed eczema so bad, his mother says, his legs and ankles were like \"raw meat.\" He started having seizures so severe that he'd turn blue up to 15 times a day.\n\n\"I thought I was losing him forever, and I was devastated,\" Nicole said.\n\nBut he recently had his tonsils and adenoids removed, allowing him to breathe on his own and freeing him from the array of medical equipment that was hooked up to him. Since then, the parents have seen a vast improvement. He's begun lifting his head and using his hands and feet in ways he couldn't before -- a spark of hope after a year of heartache.\n\nOn the fridge, the family displays a hand-splattered painting by Anias, titled by his parents. \"Painted this with the right hand that I'm not supposed to be able to use,\" it says.\n\n\"Anias had like Mount Everest medically,\" Nicole said. \"That's what I've started to appreciate is, he climbed his medical mountain.\"\n\nChristian said, \"He's making progress. It's just slow. But it's there, every day.\"\n\n'You just want him to fly'\n\nWhen CNN last visited, the boys were closer in their progress, considering that the surgery had set them back to infancy in many ways. They had to learn how to sit up, crawl and do the other things every baby learns. Anias was a few months behind Jadon developmentally, but it seemed he was on track to catch up. He was able to roll and clap his hands.\n\nAnias lost most of his function over the last year, but his parents say they've begun to see major progress in the past few weeks.\n\n\"What was hard was to see that he was on the same path as Jadon, and then something happened -- lots of things happened -- to pull him out of that race for a minute,\" Nicole said. \"I feel like I'm constantly fighting for the Anias I know.\"\n\nAs a mom, she says, \"you just want him to fly, and he's still stuck on the ground. That was really difficult, but we just had this ray of hope, like in the last month.\n\n\"That's lifts us both,\" she said, \"and we're ready to help him take off.\n\n\"He's the most medically stable he's ever been. He's getting stronger every day,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see a huge change in him over this next year.\"\n\nShe's determined to see Anias become the boy she believes he can be. She tells him things like \"someday, you're going to sit up. Someday, you're going to walk to me.\" He often smiles at her encouraging words.\n\nBoth parents say they are focused in the moment, simply trying to enjoy their boys and relishing their growth.\n\nNicole says she will never stop advocating and fighting for her boys.\n\n\"The boys, they may not be perfectly normal little boys like you and me,\" Christian said. \"But that doesn't mean they can't have a great life.\"\n\nHe says he and his wife used to worry about things like whether the boys' hair would grow back enough to cover the scars on their heads from the various surgeries. But now, they now intentionally cut their hair short: \"They earned those scars. You know, they can be proud of them.\"\n\nAt the family table, Nicole recounts a story of Jadon spilling a drink at lunch and how he put her at ease, saying, \"Mommy, it's just an accident.\" She says he then looked at her and said, \"I am smart.\" She laughed and told him, \"You are smart.\" Nicole was still laughing when Jadon added, \"I am funny.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs she tells this story, Jadon looks at her attentively.

It's legal to sell to anyone,\" he said.\n\nYet in recent years, more attention has turned to how much alcohol young people are drinking, not necessarily the age at which drinking starts.\n\nResearch suggests that the greater economic wealth a country has , the more alcohol is consumed and the higher the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking.\n\nWhere teen drinking is highest and lowest\n\nBinge or heavy episodic drinking can be measured as consuming at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. Worldwide, about 16% of drinkers 15 and older engage in heavy episodic drinking, according to WHO.\n\n\"Ten grams of alcohol is a standard drink , which is approximately almost a bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a standard drink of spirits,\" Rekve said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a standard drink as equal to 14 grams of pure alcohol.\n\nIn 2016, the country with the highest percentage of 15- to 19-year-olds reporting heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days was Luxembourg, with 54%, according to WHO. Equatorial Guinea followed with 53.7% and then Lithuania with 53.2%.\n\nNo other countries had more than half of teens in that age group report heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days.\n\nCountries where no 15- to 19-year-olds reported heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days were Mauritania, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"Europe usually is really high, both for the adult population and for 15- to 19-year-olds,\" Rekve said. More than one-fifth of the European population 15 and older has reported heavy episodic drinking at least once a week, according to WHO.\n\nHe added, however, that many European countries have recently seen a drop in alcohol use that mirrors the number of adolescents abstaining from drinking altogether.\n\nOne study, published in the journal BMC Public Health in October, found that 29% of 16- to 24-year-olds in England were non-drinkers in 2015, up from 18% in 2005.\n\nWHO report published in September found that, across 15 European countries and regions, more than 1 in 5 15-year-old girls reported weekly drinking in 2002, with the highest prevalence in England, Scotland, Malta and Denmark. But by 2014, only Malta had a prevalence greater than 20%.\n\nAmong 15-year-old boys, more than 1 in 5 reported weekly drinking across 24 European countries and regions, with the highest prevalence in Malta, Denmark, England, and Wales. But by 2014, only nine countries and regions had a prevalence greater than 20%, with the highest prevalence in Croatia, Malta, and Italy, according to the report.\n\nIn the United States, rates of binge drinking among teenagers also have been on the decline.\n\nThose percentages were down from 2013, when it was reported by 10.2%, 25.7% and 39.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the report.\n\nOverall, the percentage of teenagers in America who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases,\" she said\n\nHow heavy drinking can affect young people's health\n\nStudies have varied, but some researchers say no amount of alcohol is good for your health, and binge drinking can damage the body and brain, especially in a young person. Evidence suggests that heavy exposure to alcohol can be tied to brain impairment and cognitive deficits , including memory problems.\n\nJUST WATCHED How alcohol affects your health Replay More Videos ...

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "New Horizons: Nasa probe survives flyby of Ultima Thule", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46729898", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA HQ Image caption Alan Stern and Alice Bowman celebrate the arrival of New Horizons' signal\n\nThe US space agency's New Horizons probe has made contact with Earth to confirm its successful flyby of the icy world known as Ultima Thule.\n\nThe encounter occurred some 6.5bn km (4bn miles) away, making it the most distant ever exploration of an object in our Solar System.\n\nNew Horizons acquired gigabytes of photos and other observations during the pass.\n\nIt will now send these home over the coming months.\n\nThe radio message from the robotic craft was picked up by one of Nasa's big antennas, in Madrid, Spain.\n\nIt had taken fully six hours and eight minutes to traverse the great expanse of space between Ultima and Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption A good, clear signal was picked up by the radio antenna system in Spain\n\nControllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland greeted the reception of the signal with cheers and applause.\n\n\"We have a healthy spacecraft,\" announced Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman. \"We've just accomplished the most distant flyby.\"\n\nThis first radio message contained only engineering information on the status of the spacecraft, but it included confirmation that New Horizons executed its autonomous flyby observations as instructed and that the probe's onboard memory was full.\n\nA later downlink on Tuesday will see some choice images returned to give scientists and the public a taster of what New Horizons saw through its cameras.\n\nIf there is one note of caution it is that the timing and orientation of the spacecraft had to be spot on if the probe was not to shoot pictures of empty space!

ownership so that \"honest citizens\" can carry arms and \"protect themselves\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A giant figure of Mr Bolsonaro has been erected for the inauguration in Brasilia\n\nOn Saturday, he tweeted that he would issue a decree to allow citizens who do not have a criminal record to own guns.\n\nDays after being elected, he picked Brazil's most famous anti-corruption judge, Sergio Moro, as his minister of justice.\n\nMr Moro, who has been the key force behind the massive Car Wash corruption investigation, accepted despite having said in the past that he would never enter politics.\n\nWhile the move was welcomed by some who see Judge Moro as a relentless fighter against corruption others criticised the judge for \"abandoning\" his corruption investigation.\n\nWhy are environmentalists worried?\n\nEnvironmentalists were aghast when Mr Bolsonaro announced that as part of his drive to streamline Brazil's government, he would merge the ministry of agriculture and that of the environment.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Ricardo Salles has been chosen as the new environment minister by Mr Bolsonaro\n\nMr Bolsonaro argued that such a move would cut down on the red tape farmers faced but environmentalists feared that it would erode the protection of the Amazon rain forest.\n\nDays after his election and in the face of severe criticism by the then-ministers of the environment and agriculture he backtracked on the issue.\n\nJust days before the second round of the election, he also revoked a pledge to quit the Paris climate accord, which sets targets for cutting greenhouse gases.\n\nThe man he has named as his environment minister has since confirmed that Brazil will remain part of the Paris Agreement.\n\nHow will Brazil's international relations be affected?\n\nMr Bolsonaro has been very clear about who he considers to be his international allies and those he views as foes.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is \"an example\" to him and Mr Bolsonaro has promised to follow the US lead and relocate Brazil's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Bolsonaro visited a synagogue with Benjamin Netanyahu in Rio\n\nFollowing a meeting with Mr Bolsonaro on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was only a matter of \"when, not if\" Brazil would make the move.\n\nHe also accused Cuba of holding back some of the salaries paid to Cuban doctors working in Brazil, prompting Cuba to pull out their doctors in retaliation.\n\nBut his harshest words have been for those \"reds\" he accuses of corruption within Brazil.\n\nSpeaking to his supporters ahead of the second round, he said he would \"purge\" the country of such criminal elements and they would face either jail or leaving Brazil altogether."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Paul Whelan: Family deny American

Having trekked all the way from their home countries, the few hundred refugees here are determined to reach the UK in any way possible.\n\nMohamed from Iran, told me he had tried twice in the past week, setting off in a tiny boat with 10 other men who had all paid smugglers to help them. He is trying to reach the UK because his wife and children are already there.\n\nOn their first attempt they ran out of fuel. The second time they got close to the English coast and phoned 999, seeking assistance from UK coastguards, but he said a French vessel turned up instead and they were returned to France.\n\nThe reason refugees are increasingly trying the sea crossing, we were told, is that heightened security around French ports and the Channel tunnel has made it almost impossible to stow away on lorries and trains.\n\nIt is in desperation that people are turning to boats instead.\n\nMr Javid, who returned from a family holiday in South Africa after coming under pressure to act, earlier agreed an \"enhanced action plan\" with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to be put in place in the coming week.\n\nIt includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokeswoman said Theresa May supported the home secretary's work to tackle the \"deeply concerning rise\" in migrants crossing the Channel on small boats.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Two more cutters will be deployed in the Channel\n\nDover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was important illegal migrants were not allowed to stay in the UK.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"What we need to see now is this Dover patrol work hand in glove with the French authorities in a new Channel compact, so that anyone found in the English Channel in one of these unseaworthy craft can be helped carefully and safely back to the French coast - so that they know there is no chance of getting into Britain.\"\n\nBut Ben Bano, from the Seeking Sanctuary migrant support group, warned migrants should not be demonised.\n\nHe said: \"We have to hold on to the fact that people, however desperate they are, are our brothers and sisters in humanity, and that is what we need to keep reminding people about.

But what I've been discovering recently has shaken me to the core.\n\nI can barely look a Babybel in the face. A half-eaten halloumi squeaklessly lies yellowing in the fridge. My cheese dreams are shattering.\n\nFor, after a lifetime of unfettered devotion, could it possibly be that cheese is more foe than friend? That I am addicted to something that is not so good for my body? That cheese should be toast?\n\nThese are questions that began surfacing a couple of months ago when I began making an episode for my new podcast for the BBC, All Hail Kale, looking into whether dairy was scary.\n\nFor some time, I'd increasingly been questioning the logic of adults drinking milk.\n\nWhile milk and dairy products, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein and calcium and can form part of a healthy, balanced diet, as Dr Michael Greger, from NutritionFacts.org, put it to me: \"There's no animal on the planet that drinks milk after weaning - and then to drink milk of another species even doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nHe then reeled off a series of studies showing the life-shortening potential of drinking this \"hormonal stew\".\n\nI'd always blithely assumed cheese was a more mature - perhaps benign or even more beneficial - form of dairy. It fitted a mental picture of spritely, long-living Greeks and Italians liberally sprinkling around feta and pecorino; yet in reality, only a low to moderate amount of cheese figures in the hallowed Mediterranean Diet.\n\nI'd also unilaterally decided that a childhood diagnosis of lactose-intolerance should in no way impede me from mainlining paneer when in India or, when skiing, spending more time forking bread into fondue than bothering with the slopes.\n\nDe-cheese?\n\nPerhaps this sense of denial-cum-delusion stems from an actual addiction. One US doctor controversially (and not supported by any of the professors I spoke to) refers to cheese as \"dairy crack\" - for apparently containing addictive, opiate-like chemicals - and even suggests a three-step programme to de-cheese.\n\nStep One: know why you want to break away.\n\nWell, I don't know that I do want to break away.\n\nBut in the journalistic pursuit of seeing whether cheese is a less scary form of dairy than milk, I took my head out of the sand (under which a special Turkish cheese is apparently fermented) and contacted three heavy-hitters in nutrition. They all agreed the milk secretion of another species is a strange thing for us to have latched onto - and adult humans have no need to drink it. But could a cheese consensus be reached?\n\nDr Michael Greger took a hard line: cheese, with its combination of sodium and concentrated butterfat, should not be part of our daily diets. \"Make it for a special occasion rather than the day-to-day.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDr Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health - took a more semi-hard view of cheese. \"It does not seem to have the same growth-promoting effects as milk does. Have your Brie in moderation and enjoy it.\" He said we should have only one portion of dairy a day.\n\nOver at Cornell University, its Nutrition professor David Levitsky took a distinctly softer stance on the perils of dairy - and confessed to having a small cheese plate before dinner every night. \"I enjoy it, but I don't eat masses of cheese.\"\n\nThe consensus, of sorts, was that cheese should certainly not be at the high end of the spectrum.\n\nIn the spirit of de-ostriching, I then went to see a GP, Dr Enam Abood from the Harley Street Health Centre to get my lactose intolerance retested 30 years on.\n\nShe confirmed that not only was the intolerance still in force but by ignoring it I might have inflamed my gut.\n\nAccording to Dr Abood, my ropey gut means I'm probably not absorbing vitamins and minerals, which isn't great for my immune system, energy levels, and even maybe my mood.\n\nThe damage is most likely the result of me overdoing dairy for years.\n\nDr Abood recommended that if I consume cheese, I should pop a lactase pill - giving me the enzyme I, and many people like me, lack to be able to digest dairy properly.\n\nThe one silver (gut) lining from my medical travels was an intestinal expert telling me that a nice piece of bacteria-rich, non-processed, unpasteurised cheese will go down a treat with the gut microbiome.\n\nHaving also been making an All Hail Kale episode on the crucial role of the gut to your moods, this seemed like an excellent rationale to keep cheese on the table.\n\nI never got as far as Step Two: think about what you can do to change the recipes you have already. Step Three - think about the non-dairy cheeses - seemed too much to even consider stomaching.\n\nInstead, I think about how bewildering it is to get definitive answers around nutrition. I think I should remember to carry around lactase enzyme pills.

thought to be the type-2 version of the condition - and his GP was concerned enough about the results to send him to the hospital for further tests.\n\nThere they found he was severely dehydrated and had to give him three and a half litres of saline to rehydrate him.\n\n\"That routine test probably saved my life,\" he said.\n\nAlistair Burns, national clinical director for dementia and older people's mental health for NHS England, said: \"Heart disease and dementia are two of the biggest health risks facing people in our country.\n\n\"Attending a free NHS health check is a great opportunity to discuss existing health conditions, and to work out how to reduce the risk of developing dementia and other illness in the future.\"\n\nHe said the start of a new year was the right time to commit to \"taking a simple, free and potentially life-saving step towards a healthier life\".\n\nPublic Health England said the check looked at the top causes of premature death and ill health and supported people to take action to reduce their risks."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Child health record 'red book' to go online", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46701196", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The personal child health record -

As a result, there'll continue to be some anxiety until the data can be examined.\n\n\"The highest resolution images taken at closest approach required perfect pointing, almost,\" said Project Scientist Hal Weaver. \"We think, based on everything we've seen so far, that was achieved.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Taken from a few hundred thousand km: A last image on approach to the target\n\nOther stories on the BBC you might like:\n\nUltima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe vast separation between New Horizons and Earth, coupled with the probe's small, 15-watt transmitter, mean data rates are glacial, however.\n\nThey top out at 1 kilobit per second. To retrieve all of the imagery stored on the probe is therefore expected to take until September 2020.\n\nThe first of the very highest resolution pictures are not expected on Earth until February. But this wouldn't delay the science, said Principal Investigator Alan Stern.\n\n\"But the images that come down this week will already reveal the basic geology and structure of Ultima for us, and we're going to start writing our first scientific paper next week,\" he told reporters.\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 30km across), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nAlan Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mother of the Hubble: Tributes paid to Nasa scientist", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46720014", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Roman had a lifelong fascination with the stars\n\nTributes are being paid to Dr Nancy Grace Roman, the first woman to hold an executive position at the US space agency Nasa.\n\nDr Roman was known as \"Mother of the Hubble\" for her work on the early stages of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nNasa said her most important legacy was the advancement of women in the sciences and the generations of young scientists she inspired.\n\nShe died in Maryland on Wednesday at the age of 93.\n\nDr Roman was fascinated by the clear night skies of her childhood home in Nevada from a very early age.\n\nShe joined an astronomy club when she was just 11 and her passion for stargazing continued throughout her life.\n\nBut the young Dr Roman had to fight prejudice to be allowed to study maths and science at school and university.\n\n\"I still remember asking my high school guidance teacher for permission to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin,\" she once told the Voice of America.\n\n\"She looked down her nose at me and sneered, 'What lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?'

Three years ago, the UK was exporting half a million tonnes of plastic to China and Hong Kong - accounting for almost two-thirds of all our plastic sent abroad.\n\nChina introduced its ban on \"foreign garbage\" as part of a move to upgrade its industries 12 months ago. At the time, the UK recycling industry warned that the decision would be a \"game-changer\" and that it would be a struggle to deal with the country's waste.\n\nWhere is that plastic mountain?\n\nWell, it hasn't appeared - partly thanks to other countries taking our waste plastic instead, and partly because we are burning more of it.\n\nIn the wake of mass public alarm about plastic pollution we may also be producing less plastic waste, although it's impossible to be sure of the figures\n\nWho has taken our waste instead of China?\n\nIn the 12 months to October 2018, our analysis of Environment Agency figures shows that the UK exported a total of 611,000 tonnes of recovered plastic packaging to other countries.\n\nIn the previous 12-month period (ie to October 2017), the UK exported 683,000 tonnes.\n\nSo that works out as a drop in exports of 72,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-2018.\n\nIt's clear that other countries have imported much of the plastic packaging previously reprocessed by China.\n\nBut incineration in the UK has also increased, and we may be seeing the benefits of the Blue Planet effect on public behaviour.\n\nThe fact is we can't be certain from the data what exactly has happened to the shortfall.\n\nWhere did our plastic packaging go in 2018?\n\nWell, where there's waste plastic there's potentially profit - because some of it can be lucratively recycled. So some nations have geared up their reprocessing plants to welcome our waste with open arms.\n\nMany Chinese recyclers moved their operations abroad to benefit from cheap flows of plastic in the region before then re-exporting it back to China as recycled pellets.\n\nBut not all of it has been welcomed. Several countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan have heavily restricted imports because shipments were blocking ports and the quality of the material being imported (from all countries) was poor.\n\nSo while the amount of plastic taken by China dropped by 94% between 2016-17 and 2017-18, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland and Indonesia led the pack in gobbling up the slack.\n\nMalaysia imported 105,000 tonnes in total and was way out in front. That total was 42,000 (68%) more in 2017-18 compared with the previous year.\n\nThe second most popular destination was Turkey (80,000 tonnes).\n\nPoland is in third place on the league table - although it actually received slightly less UK plastic in 2017-18 than it did in 2016-17. It's not clear why.\n\nIn fourth place is Indonesia, which along with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam - is in the top 10 for the quantity of waste plastics polluting the ocean.\n\nWhich countries recorded the biggest increase in UK plastic over the period?\n\nAnother way of analysing the data is to rank the numbers in terms of net increase (ie which countries recorded the biggest increase in 2017-18 compared with 2016-17).\n\nOn this measure, Malaysia and Turkey remain at the top while Indonesia stays in the top five.\n\nThe new entries (replacing Poland and the Netherlands) are Spain and France. Spain recorded an increase of 14,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-18, and France was just behind on 9,000.\n\nOf course, sending material abroad for recycling doesn't necessarily mean it actually gets recycled.\n\nWaste firms in the receiving country may sift through the rubbish, take out the economically valuable material and burn or even dump the rest. The waste industry is notorious in some places for its links with criminal activity.\n\nThe global illegal waste trade is estimated by the UN to be worth between \u00a38bn-\u00a39.5bn a year.\n\nCase study: Malaysia\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Campaigners say illegal waste dumps in Malaysia have become a problem since China's plastic import ban\n\nSince China's ban, Malaysia has seen a big surge in the amount of plastic it has received from abroad, including from the UK.\n\n\"Malaysia is not able to process all of the imported waste, there are limited plastic waste factories\", says Mageswari Sangaralingam who works for the Consumers' Association of Penang and for Friends of the Earth, Malaysia.\n\nAccording to Ms Sangaralingam, not only is Malaysia receiving more plastic than it can properly dispose of, some of it is low-grade which ends up as landfill. There are also some rogue recyclers who, she says, burn plastic in the open - leading to environmental harm.\n\nThe Malaysian government has announced stricter conditions on the import of plastic and says it wants to phase it out over the next three years - but Ms Sangaralingam wants an immediate outright ban.\n\n\"Malaysia is not a dumping ground and hence should stop importing plastic waste,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Could Malaysia follow China's lead and ban plastic imports outright?\n\nWhat's the UK doing about the issue?\n\nThe British Plastics Federation (BPF) told us it was \"very worried\" about the export of poor quality plastic waste. The chairman of its recycling group, Roger Baynham, told us all that UK companies should make the very best efforts to ensure plastic goes to reputable recyclers:\n\n\"The export of plastic waste is out of the control of the industry and the BPF is particularly concerned about recent reports of illegal and fraudulent exports of plastic packaging waste routed to Asia through Holland.\"\n\nThe BPF also told us it would support a global accreditation system for the waste export sector and that recycling should be done at home.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove says the UK must stop \"off-shoring its dirt\". We asked the UK government why it didn't simply ban the export of waste plastic.\n\nWe were told that while the UK was committed to \"recycling more at home\" there is a \"legitimate export market for plastics particularly for countries that manufacture new products out of recycled plastic waste\".\n\nMr Gove wants to stimulate more recycling, but UK firms wanting to process more waste in Britain complain it's hard to get funding.\n\n\"There are very few countries left where we can comfortably export to and the market is shrinking,\" warns Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association.\n\n\"People don't want to buy this material, so where on earth is this all going to go?\" he adds.\n\nMr Ellin is largely supportive of the government's new waste strategy plan, but says the UK must expand its processing capacity at a faster pace:\n\n\"We're almost at a crisis point, unless we get a plan quickly,\" he says.\n\nLess than half of all household waste is recycled\n\nOverall recycling figures have stagnated and some councils are burning 80% of all residual waste, including recyclable plastic and paper.\n\nIn the 12 months to March, 50 of 123 councils incinerated more than half the household rubbish they collected, including plastic and paper, official figures recently revealed. The worst are in London. Westminster burned 82% of all household and recyclable rubbish.\n\nLess than half of all household waste (45.2%) was recycled in 2017 - a minuscule rise of just 0.3% on the previous year. The UK now seems unlikely to reach the EU-enforced target of 50% recycling in the next two years.\n\nThe Western Riverside Waste Authority, which covers Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Wandsworth, incinerated 79% as did Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. Slough, Kirklees, Sunderland, Portsmouth and Birmingham councils all incinerated at least 70% of all plastic, paper and household rubbish.\n\nSwindon Borough Council said in November it wants to burn plastic along with other rubbish rather than sending it abroad for recycling - saying some \"isn't properly recycled\".\n\nAnalysis by the BBC suggests that recycling rates are being hindered by the myriad of different rules which are in play up and down the country. It found that nearly half (47%) of Britons asked said they disagree about what should and should not be recycled.\n\nClaire Shrewsbury, from the recycling body Wrap, told BBC News: \"The time has come for the UK to take more responsibility for its own recovered materials, and move towards a circular system for plastics and other materials.\n\n\"There is a global market for high quality resource exports to countries that manufacture products, and this is something the UK should explore.\n\n\"This will require fundamental change from all of us. And that means regulatory transformation, collaborative industry action, together with citizen behaviour change.\"\n\nMs Shrewsbury aims her comments at anyone who buys stuff and throws packaging away.\n\nThat's all of us.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46616574", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The origin of Indians has been the subject of a heated debate\n\nNew research using ancient DNA is rewriting prehistory in India - and shows that its civilisation is the result of multiple ancient migrations, writes Tony Joseph.\n\nWho are the Indians? And where did they come from?\n\nIn the last few years, the debate over these questions has become more and more heated.\n\nHindu right-wingers believe the source of Indian civilisation are people who called themselves Aryans - a nomadic tribe of horse-riding, cattle-rearing warriors and herders who composed Hinduism's oldest religious texts, the Vedas.\n\nThe Aryans, they argue, originated from India and then spread across large parts of Asia and Europe, helping set up the family of Indo-European languages that Europeans and Indians still speak today.\n\nAs it happens, many 19th Century European ethnographers and, of course, most famously, Adolf Hitler, also considered Aryans the master race who had conquered Europe, although the German leader considered them to be of Nordic lineage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Harappan civilisation thrived in north-western India and Pakistan\n\nWhen scholars use the term Aryan, it refers to a group of people who spoke Indo-European languages and called themselves Aryans. And that is how I have used it in this article. It does not refer to a race, as Hitler used it or as some in the Hindu right wing use it.\n\nMany Indian scholars have questioned the \"out of India\" thesis, arguing that these Indo-European language speakers - or Aryans - were possibly just one of many streams of prehistoric migrants who arrived in India after the decline of an earlier civilisation. This was the Harappan (or Indus Valley) civilisation, which thrived in what is now north-western India and Pakistan around the same time as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.\n\nHowever, Hindu right-wingers believe the Harappan civilisation was also an Aryan or Vedic civilisation.\n\nTensions between the two groups backing these opposing theories have only increased in the last few years, especially since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in India in 2014.\n\nInto this long-running dispute has now stepped the relatively new discipline of population genetics, which has started using ancient DNA to figure out when people moved where.\n\nStudies using ancient DNA have been rewriting prehistory all over the world in the last few years and in India, there has been one fascinating discovery after another.\n\nThe most recent study on this subject, led by geneticist David Reich of Harvard University, was published in March 2018 and co-authored by 92 scholars from all over the world - many of them leading names in disciplines as diverse as genetics, history, archaeology and anthropology.\n\nUnderneath its staid title - The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia - lay some volcanic arguments.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dholavira in Gujarat state is one of the five largest Harappan sites\n\nThe study showed that there were two major migrations into India in the last 10,000 years.\n\nThe first one originated from the Zagros region in south-western Iran (which has the world's first evidence for goat domestication) and brought agriculturists, most likely herders, to India.\n\nThis would have been between 7,000 and 3,000BCE. These Zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent - the First Indians, descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who had reached India around 65,000 years ago - and together, they went on to create the Harappan civilisation.\n\nIn the centuries after 2000 BCE came the second set of immigrants (the Aryans) from the Eurasian Steppe, probably from the region now known as Kazakhstan. They likely brought with them an early version of Sanskrit, mastery over horses and a range of new cultural practices such as sacrificial rituals, all of which formed the basis of early Hindu/Vedic culture. (A thousand years before, people from the Steppe had also moved into Europe, replacing and mixing with agriculturists there, spawning new cultures and spreading Indo-European languages).\n\nOther genetic studies have brought to light more migrations into India, such as that of the speakers of Austro-Asiatic languages who came from south-eastern Asia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption India's population is made up of a number of layers, according to the research\n\nAs I write in my book, the best way to understand the Indian population is to imagine it as a pizza, with the first Indians forming its base. Though the base of this rather irregular pizza is thin in some places and thick in others, it still serves as the support that the rest of the pizza is built upon because studies show that 50% to 65% of the genetic ancestry of Indians derives from the First Indians.\n\nOn top of the base comes the sauce that is spread over the pizza - the Harappans. And then come the toppings and the cheese - the Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European language speakers or Aryans, all of whom found their way into the subcontinent later.\n\nTo many in the Hindu right wing, these findings are unpalatable. They have been campaigning to change school curricula and remove any mention of Aryan immigration from textbooks. And on Twitter, several hugely popular right-wing \"history\" handles have long been attacking India's leading historians who have defended the theory of Aryan migrations and continue to do so.\n\nFor Hindu nationalists, there is a cost to admitting that the Aryans were not the first inhabitants of India and that the Harappan civilisation existed long before their arrival. It would mean acknowledging that Aryans or their Vedic culture were not the singular fountainhead of Indian civilisation and that its earliest sources lay elsewhere.\n\nIndia's junior minister for human resource development, Satyapal Singh, was recently quoted in the media as saying: \"Only Vedic education can nurture our children well and make them patriots who have mental discipline.\"\n\nThe idea of the mixing of different population groups is also unappealing to Hindu nationalists as they put a premium on racial purity. There is also the additional issue of the migration theory putting Aryans on the same footing as latter-day Muslim conquerors of India - such as the Mughals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi - India is a predominantly Hindu nation\n\nThese are not just theoretical debates. The ruling BJP government in Haryana state, which neighbours the Indian capital Delhi, has demanded that the Harappan civilisation be renamed the Saraswati river civilisation. Since the Saraswati is an important river that is mentioned in the earliest of the four Vedic texts, such a renaming would serve to emphasise the link between the civilisation and the Aryans.\n\nThe new study puts an end to these debates and it has thus come as a shock to the Hindu right-wing. In a tweet attacking its co-author Prof Reich, ruling party MP and former Harvard University professor Subramanian Swamy said: \"There are lies, damned lies and (Harvard's 'Third' Reich and Co's) statistics.\"\n\nHowever, the real message that the new research carries is an exciting and hopeful one: that Indians have created a long-lasting civilisation from a variety of heredities and histories.\n\nThe genius of the Indian civilisation during its best periods has been inclusion, not exclusion. Unity in diversity is, indeed, the central theme of India's genetic make-up.\n\nTony Joseph is the author of Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From, published by Juggernaut"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Pete Tong NYE 'balloon drop' cancelled after protests", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46721487", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The Manila resort had hoped to get into the Guinness book of World Records\n\nA plan to break records by releasing 130,000 balloons at a resort in the Philippines on New Year's Eve has been cancelled after a backlash over its potential environmental impact.\n\nThe party, at Okada Manila, is being headlined by British DJ Pete Tong.\n\nOrganisers had insisted the indoor event held no environmental risk as the balloons would be recycled.\n\nBut on Sunday both the resort and Tong confirmed it had been cancelled after the government got involved.\n\nIn a statement, Okada Manila said it \"voluntarily\" decided to cancel the event \"as a sign of respect\" for the government's campaign to protect the environment.\n\nIt came after they received a letter from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Sunday encouraging a change of plan.\n\nThe resort, part of a sprawling hotel and casino complex in the Philippine capital, had said that the balloons were made of \"biodegradable latex materials\" and they would be recycled afterward - not released into the air.\n\nHowever its social media pages had been inundated with concern about its message, including from campaigners such as Greenpeace Philippines.\n\nOne petition, calling for its cancellation, had garnered tens of thousands of signatures before the announcement.\n\nThe party, at the resort's Cove Manila beach club, will still take place without the world-record attempt.\n\nIn a Sunday night tweet Pete Tong confirmed promoters had dropped the balloon stunt.\n\nIn the posts below, people responded positively to the news, and shared images about the dangers of plastic pollution.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The DJ has thanked fans that raised concerns\n\nEnvironmental groups around the world, including the UK's Marine Conservation Society, have warned about the dangers balloons can pose to marine life.\n\nThe organisation says that even latex balloons marked as biodegradable can remain in an ocean environment for four years.\n\nSome places, including parts of Australia, have already banned balloon releases because of their impact."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "New Year\u2019s Resolution", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/new-year-s-resolution-1831408235", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Each year, Americans celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve by resolving to change some aspect of their lives.

Such promises have appealed to swaths of the electorate in a country that saw more than 63,000 homicides last year.\n\nBolsonaro has also promised to tackle corruption by ending the traditional horse-trading style of politics associated with the halls of power in Brasilia where coveted positions such as ministries were doled out to party power brokers in exchange for support for bills.\n\n181230110400553\n\nHowever, many analysts point out that such campaign promises are likely to be less easy to deliver given the realities in Brazil's complex and fractured political landscape.\n\nHaving risen to victory on an anti-corruption platform, alarm bells have rung in recent weeks as it was revealed that a former aide to Bolsonaro's oldest son Flavio, a state legislator for Rio de Janeiro and recently elected senator, is at the centre of unanswered payments probe."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Family of American arrested in Russia as a spy says he's innocent", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/family-american-arrested-russia-spy-innocent-190101172949817.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "The brother of a US citizen arrested in Russia on espionage charges said on Tuesday that his brother is innocent and was in Moscow to attend a wedding.\n\nPaul Whelan was arrested in Moscow on Friday.

He's used social media very effectively and so he's capitalising on the mood that's anti-political in Brazil.\"\n\nCrime and security\n\nWhile Bolsonaro has tapped into widespread discontent with the economy and political elites, he's also played on fundamental fears about security amid widespread violent crime.\n\nViolence has surged in many parts of Brazil, home to seven of the world's 20 most violentcities, in recent years.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nLast year, homicides rose to a record high figure of 63,880, up 2.9 percent from 2016, according to the Brazilian Forum of Public Security.\n\n\"Crime is a major popular concern \u2026 and it is an issue across the country, which affects all social classes, although the poor most,\" Spektor said, adding that Bolsonaro had a \"message on crime\" and Haddad didn't.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain, has pledged to tackle the security crisis by militarising the police, cracking down on criminal offenders by allowing officers greater freedom to kill, and loosening public gun laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis proposals are unlikely to prove successful, however, according to Spektor.\n\n\"The solutions he is offering have been shown to have no effect on troubling crime, on the contrary, the notion that a tough hand on crime works has been proven incorrect by existing evidence,\" he said.\n\n\"What there is evidence of is that the further militarisation of police increases very dramatically the number of homicides and killings.\"\n\nIn Rio, Bolsonaro's electoral stronghold, a military takeover of policing since February in response to acute violence throughout the city has coincided with a rise in homicide rates compared with the same period last year.\n\nStyle, not substance\n\nAccording to Lapper, Bolsonaro's appeal is not driven by well-considered policy ideas, but rather his ability to present \"simple answers to complex problems\", regardless of their efficacy.\n\nIn his more than two decades in Congress, Bolsonaro has only had two of his own bills passed into law, despite having proposed about 170 pieces of legislation.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nAllesandra Maia Terra de Faria, a professor of social science at the Rio-based Pontifical Catholic University, said Bolsonaro's strategy has never been about having \"a clear plan, or any kind of stability\".\n\n\"He's always got one phrase to sum up everything, but which also means nothing,\" de Faria said.\n\nThis rhetoric, however, has enabled him to unite various voting blocs within the Brazilian right, according to Lapper.\n\n\"There are three bits of the right in Brazil: the nostalgia right, who yearn for the security of the military dictatorship; the social right, which is linked to this very big evangelical community in Brazil; and a liberal right, who are always railing about the hypertrophy of the Brazilian state,\" he said.\n\n\"All these things have come together in Bolsonaro.\"\n\nRejection and resistance\n\nBut while Bolsonaro's bid for office proved successful, his candidacy also met forceful resistance from large sections of Brazilian society.\n\nThe opposition to Bolsonaro has been driven by his numerous discriminatory comments on race, gender and sexual orientation, as well as remarks in favour of torture and Brazil's former military dictatorship, in power from 1964 to 1985, which have angered and alarmed millions of Brazilians.\n\nBolsonaro has described having a daughter as a \"weakness\", told a congresswoman she was \"too ugly\" to be raped, claimed some black people were not \"even good for procreation\", and said he would rather one of his four sons \"die in an accident\" than be gay.\n\nIn September, he was stabbed while campaigning in the city of Juiz de Fora, in southeastern Minas Gerais state.\n\nHis suspected assailant told authorities he had been \"ordered by God\" to carry out the attack, which forced Bolsonaro to withdraw from the public campaign trail while he recovered from injuries sustained in the assault.\n\nOn September 29, hundreds of thousands of people marched in cities throughout Brazil as part of the social media-driven and women-led #EleNao (#NotHim) protest against his candidacy.\n\n\"We have a society in transition and he represents everything that is old and more conservative in Brazil,\" de Faria said.\n\n\"This is the saddest thing about Bolsonaro.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Netflix removes episode of comedy show in Saudi Arabia: FT", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/netflix-removes-episode-comedy-show-saudi-arabia-ft-190101163336016.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Netflix has removed an episode of a show critical of Saudi Arabia following a complaint by the kingdom, the Financial Times (FT) reported.\n\nThe internet-streaming service removed the second episode of Patriotic Act with Hasan Minhaj in Saudi Arabia after authorities there said the comedy act violated the kingdom's anti-cybercrime law, the report on Tuesday said.\n\nIn the episode, Minhaj, a comedian, criticised Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate, as well as the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen.\n\n\"Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee engaged in a war of words with the president on myriad issues over the past 18 months, generating headlines and fiery tweets from a president who generally insists on getting the last word. Those battles put them on the outs with many in their own party, and they paid a price. Both decided to retire rather than take on a difficult re-election campaign.\n\nFlake was far and away Trump\u2019s most consistent critic among Senate Republicans. Corker weighed in less often, but his description of the White House as an \u201cadult day care center\u201d rankled the president, who dubbed him \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker.\u201d The feud continued as Corker headed for the exits, with Trump asserting that Corker\u2019s promise to serve only two terms was not the real reason he retired. Rather, Corker \u201cwanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn\u2019t endorse him,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nCorker replied: \u201cYes, just like Mexico is paying for the wall... #AlertTheDaycareStaff.\u201d\n\nFor now, don\u2019t expect any Republican senator to take their place as chief agitator when the new Congress convenes Thursday, said Rory Cooper, a GOP strategist who helped lead the \u201cNever Trump PAC\u201d during the 2016 Republican primary. He said publicly criticizing the president makes Republican votes back home unhappy and earns the ire of the president. Meanwhile, Democratic voters and the media give them too little credit, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is not an incentive structure for senators who disagree with or oppose the president to speak out right now, but that could change if the (Robert) Mueller investigation continues to move in the direction it has been or the economy churns negative,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nTwo other Republicans, Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have both had their public run-ins with the president.\n\nThroughout his Senate campaign, Romney insisted that he would agree with Trump on some issues and not be shy about disagreeing on others. Romney appears to have more room with GOP voters in Utah to take on the president. Most voters in Utah \u2014 64 percent \u2014 would like to see the senator confront the president, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of midterm voters.\n\nBut Cooper said he doubts that\u2019s a mantle Romney wants to take on, at least not right away. After serving as governor of Massachusetts, Romney will be focused on proving that he\u2019s an advocate for Utah, Cooper said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where his head will be at the outset,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nSasse has frequently criticized Trump for what he considers the president\u2019s uncivil rhetoric. Sasse has also said he \u201cregularly\u201d considers leaving his party and becoming an independent. He is up for re-election in 2020 and has said he\u2019ll decide by the summer whether to seek a second term. It would be tricky terrain for Sasse to publicly battle with Trump, who won the state in 2016 by 25 percentage points.\n\nSenate Republicans chafe at the notion they are unwilling to take on a president whose statements and policy positions often run counter to traditional conservative positions.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he raised his concerns about trade policy privately with the president.\n\n\u201cI want results,\u201d Rounds said, \u201cinstead of hardening positions.\u201d\n\nRounds said he rode with Trump after meeting him at the airport when the president visited South Dakota during the midterm election season, telling him the state\u2019s soybean farmers were facing losses of some $500 million because of retaliatory tariffs. He said Trump told him: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a better deal for them. If they hang with me, we\u2019re going to make this better.\u201d\n\nRounds said his job is to make things better and \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I have to be out there in front fighting with someone.\u201d\n\nSen.

Behind closed doors, there are things on tariffs and things like that where we\u2019ve offered a differing opinion. But I support this president in terms of what he\u2019s trying to do. This agenda is working,\u201d Perdue said, citing strong economic growth and low unemployment.\n\nDemocratic Sen.

Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee engaged in a war of words with the president on myriad issues over the past 18 months, generating headlines and fiery tweets from a president who generally insists on getting the last word. Those battles put them on the outs with many in their own party, and they paid a price. Both decided to retire rather than take on a difficult re-election campaign.\n\nFlake was far and away Trump\u2019s most consistent critic among Senate Republicans. Corker weighed in less often, but his description of the White House as an \u201cadult day care center\u201d rankled the president, who dubbed him \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker.\u201d The feud continued as Corker headed for the exits, with Trump asserting that Corker\u2019s promise to serve only two terms was not the real reason he retired. Rather, Corker \u201cwanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn\u2019t endorse him,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nCorker replied: \u201cYes, just like Mexico is paying for the wall... #AlertTheDaycareStaff.\u201d\n\nFor now, don\u2019t expect any Republican senator to take their place as chief agitator when the new Congress convenes Thursday, said Rory Cooper, a GOP strategist who helped lead the \u201cNever Trump PAC\u201d during the 2016 Republican primary. He said publicly criticizing the president makes Republican votes back home unhappy and earns the ire of the president. Meanwhile, Democratic voters and the media give them too little credit, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is not an incentive structure for senators who disagree with or oppose the president to speak out right now, but that could change if the (Robert) Mueller investigation continues to move in the direction it has been or the economy churns negative,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nTwo other Republicans, Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have both had their public run-ins with the president.\n\nThroughout his Senate campaign, Romney insisted that he would agree with Trump on some issues and not be shy about disagreeing on others. Romney appears to have more room with GOP voters in Utah to take on the president. Most voters in Utah \u2014 64 percent \u2014 would like to see the senator confront the president, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of midterm voters.\n\nBut Cooper said he doubts that\u2019s a mantle Romney wants to take on, at least not right away. After serving as governor of Massachusetts, Romney will be focused on proving that he\u2019s an advocate for Utah, Cooper said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where his head will be at the outset,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nSasse has frequently criticized Trump for what he considers the president\u2019s uncivil rhetoric. Sasse has also said he \u201cregularly\u201d considers leaving his party and becoming an independent. He is up for re-election in 2020 and has said he\u2019ll decide by the summer whether to seek a second term. It would be tricky terrain for Sasse to publicly battle with Trump, who won the state in 2016 by 25 percentage points.\n\nSenate Republicans chafe at the notion they are unwilling to take on a president whose statements and policy positions often run counter to traditional conservative positions.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he raised his concerns about trade policy privately with the president.\n\n\u201cI want results,\u201d Rounds said, \u201cinstead of hardening positions.\u201d\n\nRounds said he rode with Trump after meeting him at the airport when the president visited South Dakota during the midterm election season, telling him the state\u2019s soybean farmers were facing losses of some $500 million because of retaliatory tariffs. He said Trump told him: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a better deal for them. If they hang with me, we\u2019re going to make this better.\u201d\n\nRounds said his job is to make things better and \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I have to be out there in front fighting with someone.\u201d\n\nSen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said \u201cthere\u2019s all sorts of active disagreements that go on\u201d with the White House behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cI support the president as well as anybody. Behind closed doors, there are things on tariffs and things like that where we\u2019ve offered a differing opinion. But I support this president in terms of what he\u2019s trying to do. This agenda is working,\u201d Perdue said, citing strong economic growth and low unemployment.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he suspects the 2020 elections will prompt more Republican senators to confront Trump when they disagree with him, and that may already be happening, citing recent actions on Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Senate passed a measure that blamed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and called on Riyadh to \u201censure appropriate accountability.\u201d Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

The Brazilian capital had moved to Bras\u00edlia, the new planned city in the country\u2019s interior, a few years prior, but Rio remained the effective center of power, and somewhere in the city, President Jo\u00e3o Goulart was clinging to power.\n\nGoulart, a leftist who became president in 1961, had spent the days prior on the phone with a top military officer, Gen. Amaury Kruel. The general was hoping to prevent the collapse of Brazil\u2019s government by urging Jango, as Goulart was known to Brazilians, to fire prominent leftist officials and institute a slate of reforms that would please both the military and the centrist establishment in Congress that opposed Goulart\u2019s shifts to the left.\n\nGoulart refused. The military marched.\n\nBy the next morning, Goulart had fled to Porto Alegre. A few days later, he was in Uruguay. Brazil\u2019s democracy had collapsed.\n\nFive decades later, on the evening of Oct. 28, 2018, members of the Brazilian military were parading through the streets of Rio again. Green Army jeeps honked their horns and flashed their lights; soldiers standing atop them waved Brazilian flags as adoring crowds cheered their arrival.\n\nThis time, though, the military was not coming to depose a president, but to celebrate him. Jair Bolsonaro, a federal congressman and former Army captain, had just won the election to become Brazil\u2019s 38th president.\n\nMilitares brasileros desfilan por las calles de R\u00edo festejando el triunfo de Bolsonaro y la gente los vitorea. Qu\u00e9 pesadilla. pic.twitter.com/hh1gAiHA0r \u2014 Diego Iglesias (@IglesiasDiego) October 29, 2018\n\n\u201cWhat a nightmare,\u201d Argentine journalist Diego Iglesias tweeted in Spanish of the scene.\n\nBolsonaro, whose presidency will begin with a New Year\u2019s Day inaugural ceremony in Bras\u00edlia, has routinely praised Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which gave way to the return of democratic governance in 1985. And his rise to power shares many similarities with the military regime\u2019s: Bolsonaro has seized on widespread discontent and fatigue with an incapable and corrupt political establishment, on fervid opposition to a leftist party that had spent more than a decade in power, on an economic collapse that Brazil has only slowly begun to escape, and on rising levels of violent crime.\n\nAnd while he has pitched his surge to power as the result of a \u201cpopulist\u201d revolt, his base of support mirrors that of the old coup masters: wealthy financial elites, segments of the population willing to trade the rights and lives of the poor and marginalized for their own safety and economic prosperity, and traditional parties and politicians who refuse to acknowledge their own roles in creating the monster before folding themselves into his arms.\n\nAP Photo/Leo Correa In this Dec. 1, 2018 photo, Jair Bolsonaro, left, and Minister of Defense Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna attend a graduation ceremony at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Resende, Brazil.\n\nMuch like the military once did, Bolsonaro has threatened his leftist political opponents with violence and imprisonment. He has promised to deliver a political \u201ccleansing never seen before in Brazil,\u201d and threatened media outlets that report news unfavorable to him. His vice president is a former Army general who, in an interview with HuffPost Brazil, refused to rule out a return to military rule, and who has posited \u2014 over Bolsonaro\u2019s unconvincing objections \u2014 that the new administration could rewrite the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThis is not exclusively a Brazilian phenomenon. Countries around the world, from Hungary to Turkey to the Philippines, have turned to noisy leaders who promise instant renewals and silver-bullet solutions under the banner of a right-wing, nativist \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2015 the preferred term of news outlets, even though the key constituencies backing these candidates tend to comprise the nations\u2019 elite.\n\nEach major election has become, in part, a referendum on the state of global democracy as a whole. And each victory for a right-wing, anti-democratic figure has paved the way for a similar candidate in the next major election somewhere else.\n\nOf the bunch, though, Bolsonaro might be the most pressing threat to a major democracy. Brazil\u2019s is the fourth-largest in the world, and the largest by population in Latin America. If it dies, this time, it won\u2019t be at the hands of the armed forces. It will be self-inflicted.\n\n\u201cThere have been very, very few military coups in Latin America over the last 35 years,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and author of How Democracies Die. \u201cSo I think that while increased public support for a military coup is troubling, it\u2019s much more likely Brazilian democracy will die at the hands of an elected leader.\u201d\n\nBrazil is about to show the world how a modern democracy falls apart.\n\n\u2018Democracy Hasn\u2019t Delivered\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Bolsonaro supporters rally and pray in Bras\u00edlia ahead of a New Year's Day inauguration ceremony that will make him Brazil's 38th president.\n\nIt was still too early for an afternoon beer when I passed the first vendor doling out ice-cold cervejas along S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Avenida Paulista on a Brazilian summer day in late November.\n\nPaulista, which splits one of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, was closed thanks to a mid-week holiday, storefronts advertised Black Friday sales, and a giant Christmas tree outside one of the shopping malls gave away the approaching holiday season. Locals and tourists alike perused pop-up tents selling handcrafted wooden bowls and art, and loudspeakers blared a pop soundtrack for the people who\u2019d come to do yoga in the street.\n\nAside from the occasional bit of political graffiti sprayed onto a lamp post or the sidewalk, there were barely any signs that throughout 2018, Brazilians had repeatedly swarmed Avenida Paulista to demonstrate in favor of and against Bolsonaro.\n\nIt was here, in July, that people in S\u00e3o Paulo joined the largest women-led protest in Brazilian history, as women and LGBTQ people who feared Bolsonaro\u2019s history of racist, sexist and homophobic statements urged Brazilians to vote for anyone else. \u201cEle N\u0101o,\u201d they yelled \u2015 \u201cNot Him.\u201d\n\nIt was also here that Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters gathered in mid-October for a rally meant to push him over the majority threshold he had fallen just short of in the first round of voting. At that demonstration, Bolsonaro, who had been stabbed on the campaign trail in September, told the crowd via a cell phone that, as president, he would target funding for the media and human rights groups. He vowed to give his opponent \u2015 former S\u00e3o Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party \u2015 and prominent leftist activists two options: \u201cLeave, or go to jail.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of November? \u201cEverything feels normal,\u201d a friend told me, \u201cuntil you watch the news.\u201d\n\nFERNANDO SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators take part in a protest against Bolsonaro organized under the hashtag #EleNao (#NotHim), in Rio de Janeiro on Oct. 20, 2018.\n\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro is a creature of the rot in his country\u2019s democratic institutions that had set in years before he\u2019d entered the picture, or that had been there all along.\n\nPower in Brazil has always remained concentrated largely among a white and wealthy elite; literacy and education rates are still low, especially among the poor; an over-militarized and under-trained police force has continued to kill large numbers of poor (and mostly black) citizens; and the return to democracy was marked by more than a decade of economic instability and hyperinflation that perpetuated vast social, racial and income inequality.\n\nStill, Brazil has spent much of the last several decades fashioning itself into a shining example of what a democratic Latin America could one day look like. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso stabilized the economy in the early 2000s, then leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a working-class firebrand, presided over a period of rapid growth that had Brazil\u2019s economy on pace to surpass those of France and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn da Silva\u2019s watch, expanded social welfare programs helped some 30 million Brazilians rise out of poverty, and broader affirmative action policies increased educational, health and employment access for black Brazilians, women, the poor and the indigenous. Violent crime fell to its lowest levels in decades. When da Silva left office in 2010, his approval ratings neared 90 percent. Brazil, it seemed, was finally working.\n\nOr was it? In 2010, Tiririca, a Brazilian clown, announced a run for a congressional seat in S\u00e3o Paulo and launched a campaign meant to parody the Brazilian political system. \u201cPior do que est\u00e1 n\u00e3o fica, vote no Tiririca,\u201d he said: \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse, vote Tiririca.\u201d He playfully satirized the corruption endemic in Brazilian politics, promising that he would \u201cenrich every Brazilian family \u2015 especially mine.\u201d\n\nThen he won, and that victory, in retrospect, might have been a sign of a lurking discontent that Bolsonaro would soon exploit.\n\nUeslei Marcelino / Reuters Tiririca, a Brazilian comedian and member of the Lower House of Congress, is congratulated after voting in favor of the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia, on April 17, 2016.\n\nBrazil was already one of the world\u2019s most unequal countries in terms of income distribution, and while the poor unquestionably benefited from the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s policies \u2015 including a hike in the minimum wage \u2015 the vast majority of the economic gains achieved under da Silva went to the richest 1 percent of Brazil\u2019s population. So even as a new lower-middle class earned more than it ever had, Brazil\u2019s obscene levels of income inequality likely expanded during the good years. Violent crime had been reduced, but not to levels befitting a developed democracy: Even before the economic collapse, Brazil was home to more than a dozen of the planet\u2019s 50 most violent cities.\n\nThings got worse: The economy collapsed in 2013, plunging millions out of work and millions more back into poverty. In 2014, a money-laundering investigation turned into the world\u2019s broadest political corruption investigation. Known as Operation Car Wash, or \u201cLava Jato\u201d in Portuguese, it has implicated hundreds of Brazilian politicians, including da Silva and outgoing President Michel Temer, of the centrist Democratic Movement Party. Violent crime has surged \u2015 there were more than 60,000 homicides in each of the last two years. President Dilma Rousseff, da Silva\u2019s hand-picked successor, was impeached in 2016. Da Silva was convicted on money-laundering charges in 2017 and imprisoned this year; Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\n\nCompared with their counterparts across Latin America, Brazilians have always shown a low level of support for democracy. That support has eroded even further amid the crises: In 2017, just 32 percent of Brazilians agreed when Latinobar\u00f3metro, which conducts polls across the region, asked if they agreed that \u201cdemocracy may have problems but is the best system of government.\u201d No other Latin American nation showed less support for democracy, while other surveys found that nearly two-thirds of Brazilians had lost faith in political parties, the presidency and Congress. More than half of Brazilians said they would support a more authoritarian style of government if it \u201csolved problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask people on the street if they\u2019re worried about what Bolsonaro may mean for democracy, it\u2019s not like people are particularly concerned,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cDemocracy,\u201d he said, \u201chasn\u2019t delivered what many of us have expected.\u201d\n\nEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him. Marcelo Amador Pereira, S\u00e3o Paulo resident\n\nThe PT, as the Workers\u2019 Party is known by its initials in Portuguese, has received much of the blame for the backlash that fueled Bolsonaro\u2019s rise. A great deal of this criticism is legitimate: Da Silva and the Workers\u2019 Party had risen to power on something resembling revolutionary hope \u2015 a belief \u201cthat it could use the established order in Brazil to benefit the poor, without harm \u2013 indeed with help \u2013 to the rich,\u201d as the British essayist Perry Anderson wrote in 2016.\n\nBy the time Rousseff was impeached in 2016, to the delight of millions of mostly middle-class and wealthy Brazilians who had marched in the streets demanding her ouster, the party had embraced a brand of economic austerity and engaged in the sort of corruption that alienated many of its own working-class supporters.\n\nIn addition to its usual base of elites, the counter-revolution in Brazil could now count on winning at least some support from the PT\u2019s natural constituency. Bolsonaro drew support from across the political and social spectrum, even from poor and black voters whom some of his most repressive policy goals will surely target. Polls ahead of the election showed that Bolsonaro led Haddad among black and mixed-race voters and women \u2015 and that he also earned a surprisingly large share of the vote from LGBTQ Brazilians \u2015 despite his racism, sexism and homophobia.\n\n\u201cEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him,\u201d Marcelo Amador Pereira, a black man who lives in S\u00e3o Paulo and lost his job during the Rousseff administration, told HuffPost Brazil before the election. \u201cBecause he is running against the PT, and I will not accept any part in what the PT did to Brazil.\u201d\n\nElite Failure \u2015 And Acquiescence\n\nGetty Editorial Protesters hold signs saying \"Temer Out\" in Portuguese to protest the unpopular centrist leader who took power after the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Temer's links to corruption and pursuit of unpopular economic reforms sent his approval ratings into the single digits for most of his two years in office.\n\nThe problem with pitching Bolsonaro\u2019s rise to power as a purely populist revolt, though, is that the main source of his support was not the poor and working classes that had once fervently backed the Workers\u2019 Party, but the same elites Bolsonaro constantly railed against, who have taken almost no responsibility for their role in creating the circumstances that made his ascent possible.\n\nHealthy democracy relies on mutual support for a basic set of rules, but in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election, Brazil\u2019s center-right establishment began to disregard the old consensus. The center-right Social Democratic Party, or PSDB, questioned the results of Rousseff\u2019s narrow re-election that fall, giving oxygen to fringe social media conspiracy theories that the Workers\u2019 Party president had benefited from election fraud.\n\nTwo years later, the centrist parties launched an effort to impeach her that looked less like an effort to hold Rousseff accountable than a chance for Brazil\u2019s establishment to seize via goo-goo crusade the sort of power it couldn\u2019t win at the ballot box \u2014 and protect itself from judicial and public scrutiny in the process. For others on the right, including Bolsonaro, it was merely an opportunity to rid Brazil of a leftist government that they claimed had waged a war on \u201cGod, family and the Brazilian people.\u201d\n\nPaulo Whitaker/Reuters Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff with Vice President Michel Temer, left, and outgoing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, right, on Jan. 1, 2011. Since then, Rousseff has been impeached, Da Silva has been imprisoned and Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\n\nOperation Car Wash, meanwhile, has long been viewed as a positive development for Brazilian democracy, an effort to rid the country\u2019s political system of the corruption that runs rampant through it. But it\u2019s undeniable now, even for the investigation\u2019s proponents, that it played a role in undermining democracy instead of bolstering it.\n\n\u201cOne of the undesired results of the Lava Jato case \u2015 this confrontation of corruption \u2015 is a very extreme polarization of the public debate in Brazil,\u201d said Bruno Brand\u00e3o, the Brazil director of Transparency International. \u201cIt also discredited the political system and the political class. And more worrisome, it discredited the democratic system itself.\u201d\n\nThe polarization isn\u2019t entirely the result of the corruption investigation \u2015 on the left and the right, the parties of implicated politicians have spent years trying to discredit Car Wash. Temer repeatedly attempted to curtail it; Congress tried to kill new anti-corruption legislation in the middle of the night; da Silva and the PT decried it as an elite effort to destroy the left, which wasn\u2019t entirely true, given that a rash of politicians from other parties were removed from office and sent to prison, too.\n\nBut the investigators themselves helped undermine the credibility of their cause and, by extension, democracy. Judge Sergio Moro, who spearheaded the Car Wash investigation, was responsible for the conviction of da Silva, who had led presidential polls before he was banned from the race thanks to the corruption case.\n\nMoro spent years positioning himself as apolitical, but his pursuit of da Silva took on an air of zealotry. The conviction was criticized as sloppy and legally questionable by independent Brazilian legal experts, and the timing of certain revelations from Moro \u2014 wiretapped phone calls between Rousseff and da Silva, released in 2016 in the midst of her impeachment; testimony accusing da Silva, Haddad and the PT of graft, unsealed the eve of the election \u2014 suggested the judge was putting a finger on the scales of the cases and, perhaps, the election. (In November, Moro agreed to serve as the head of the National Justice Ministry under Bolsonaro.)\n\nThroughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t win, but that he couldn\u2019t. When they didn\u2019t ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow.\n\nBrazil\u2019s elites and its media, meanwhile, underestimated the strength of the anti-establishment surge taking place under their feet, or the dynamics allowing it to fester. Over and over again throughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t win, but that he couldn\u2019t. When they didn\u2019t ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow; surely his worst, most provocative statements would be enough to convince Brazilians he was too radical a reactionary.\n\nBeneath the surface, Bolsonaro and his supporters took advantage of social media, amplifying his message across Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp \u2015 Brazil\u2019s most popular social network \u2015 exploiting both the existing distrust of Brazil\u2019s largest media outlets and the utility of those social networks for spreading news that was baseless and manufactured out of thin air.\n\nMembers of the media and political elite were sure that, with da Silva and the PT seemingly discredited, a moderate, establishment figure from the center-left or center-right would emerge. But Brazilians made their fatigue with the centrist establishment clear: Whereas the Workers\u2019 Party still won more seats than any other party in congressional elections, the center-right was crushed in the first round of voting. Cynicism, corruption and the pursuit of unpopular economic policies under Temer had left a vacuum on the right, and along came Bolsonaro to fill the void.\n\nBolsonaro wielded corruption as a cudgel against the PT from the start, turning its links to Car Wash into an all-out attack on its legitimacy and right to exist. The left, Bolsonaro suggested on his website, wanted to \u201cimport ideologies that destroy our identity\u201d as Brazilians. That appealed to growing evangelical and conservative movements, as well as segments of the middle classes that opposed the left\u2019s social liberalism, and played on a backlash against efforts to advance the civil rights of the poor, LGBTQ people and black Brazilians.\n\nThat Bolsonaro had adopted an anti-corruption posture merely as a campaign tactic \u2015 much like Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d \u2015 was evident even before he took office. Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Fl\u00e1vio, is already facing questions about potential corruption, and despite pledging that his government ministries would not include anyone convicted of corruption, Bolsonaro has appointed at least seven people who have been or currently are involved in such scandals, according to The Intercept. They include his chief of staff and his finance minister, Paulo Guedes \u2015 the University of Chicago\u2013educated economist and free marketeer whose close ties to Bolsonaro during the campaign gave Brazil\u2019s business elite the assurances they needed to cozy up to the supposed \u201cpopulist.\u201d\n\nAs with Trump, Bolsonaro\u2019s attack on corruption went beyond hypocrisy. It was a Herrenvolk appeal \u2014 spoils for the dominant class, banishment or marginalization for everyone else \u2014 and the tubthumping about corruption fit into larger themes about the contamination of Brazilian identity by the country\u2019s underclasses.\n\nFor the whole of history, as Hannah Arendt wrote, totalitarians have depended on a coalition between the elite and the mob. In Brazil, as elsewhere, the rise of a new authoritarian required the acquiescence of a patrician class unwilling to accept any of the blame for the systemic ills the country was facing. And while so much media attention was lavished on the ordinary folks who supported Bolsonaro, it was more significant that his levels of support rose with each step up the income ladder, thanks to elites who shared his disdain for the left and were happy to empower a fascist to thwart it.\n\nThe worst ills Bolsonaro would inflict would be reserved for the most vulnerable of Brazil\u2019s populations, anyway. The elites, as always, are exempt from the pain they cause.\n\n\u2018Bolsonaro Can Do Things Trump Can\u2019t Do\u2019\n\nAFP Bolsonaro will take power with high levels of public support for some of his most dangerous policy proposals \u2014 including his calls to allow police officers even more leeway to shoot and kill alleged criminals.\n\nIf this all seems to bear a striking resemblance to what happened in the United States, that\u2019s no coincidence. Bolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\n\nTrump, too, was merely a symptom of a larger disease, a product of declining faith among Americans in their democratic institutions. And Bolsonaro adopted many of Trump\u2019s strategies: He, too, encouraged violence against critics, appealed to nativist and racist fears, and suggested that if he lost, it would be the result of political rivals\u2019 shenanigans. He also called for imprisoning not just his opponent, but activists who worked on the left. He targeted civil society, suggesting that nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups would be shut down. He promised to give law enforcement even more leeway to kill on sight and decried the media as agents of fake news who were simply protecting the corrupt establishment.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s campaign, like Trump\u2019s, also made a habit of tossing out increasingly absurd and anti-democratic ideas, often filtered through his son Fl\u00e1vio, a congressman who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s de facto social media guru. Fl\u00e1vio and vice presidential candidate Gen. Antonio Hamilton Mour\u00e3o would suggest increasingly radical ideas \u2015 like, say, closing Congress if necessary \u2015 only for the elder Bolsonaro to gently walk them back if a reporter asked about them or if they generated too much scrutiny.\n\nThis strategy, deliberately or not, has the effect of making Bolsonaro look more moderate than he is while shifting the very grounds on which he is being evaluated. Now, a Bolsonaro who does everything short of closing Congress, rewriting the constitution or re-establishing military rule starts to resemble a committed democrat.\n\nBolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\n\nA key difference between Bolsonaro and Trump, though, is that the worst version of the former will have much more damaging effects on Brazilian democracy than the latter has had, or could have, in the United States.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro can do things in Brazil, potentially, that Trump can\u2019t do,\u201d Levitsky said, \u201cbecause Brazilian institutions ... are nowhere near as strong as they are in the United States.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s ministerial appointments include more former military officers to serve at once in a civilian government than in any since the end of the dictatorship. He has appointed ministers who wield the same paranoid, anti-\u201cglobalist\u201d rhetoric that became commonplace in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nBolsonaro and his choice to head the education ministry, Ricardo V\u00e9lez Rodr\u00edguez, are supporters of the Escolas sem Partido (Schools Without Party) movement, a previously fringe effort to prevent public schools and universities from \u201cindoctrinating\u201d students with leftist political ideologies. There were reports in the days after the election that some universities had been raided to rid them of books on fascism, and that professors and other academics who opposed the new president and had described him as a fascist were targeted and harassed.\n\nBolsonaro, too, has sent early signals that he will follow through on his threats to seize indigenous lands to open them to mining and agricultural interests; he has said Brazil should \u201cintegrate\u201d its indigenous tribes \u2015 which include those living on protected reservations, as well as uncontacted peoples \u2015 into Brazilian society against their wishes.\n\nEven in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil will become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression.\n\nIt is possible Bolsonaro will govern as a true autocrat \u2015 that he could take advantage of any small crisis to consolidate power and sweep aside democracy in a single act. He could close Congress; he could criminalize the Workers\u2019 Party and other leftist opposition parties and movements; he could criminalize dissent, protest and the free press.\n\nMore likely is that he will govern in a manner similar to Trump, targeting the press, political opponents and democratic institutions with a constant barrage of criticism that further erodes their credibility among his supporters and the public writ large, and has a chilling effect on legitimate opposition. Bolsonaro refers to nearly everything to his political left as \u201ccommunism,\u201d and has said his movement is meant to keep \u201cforeign ideologies\u201d from making their way to Brazil. Rather than outright dictatorship, Bolsonaro\u2019s reign could come to resemble the ugliest anti-left purge in American history.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like McCarthyism,\u201d Alexandre Padilha, a high-ranking member of the Workers\u2019 Party who served in da Silva\u2019s government, told me. \u201cHe hates everything that is left in Brazil, and thinks they should be eliminated, basically.\u201d\n\nTo the right, these fears and the rhetoric that has inspired them are a source of humor. The day before the inauguration, Carlos Bolsonaro \u2015 a Rio councilman and another of the new president\u2019s sons \u2015 posted a video on Twitter of his father celebrating police killings and calling his opponents \u201cpussies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left is crying,\u201d he said, mockingly.\n\nIn the U.S., Trump\u2019s continued attacks have had negative effects on how Americans view their elections, the press and other democratic institutions, and his rhetoric has emboldened racists and white nationalists and potentially contributed to rises in violent crime against racial, ethnic and religious minorities.\n\nPolitical violence is already shockingly common in Brazil: In 2018, Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco was assassinated while leaving an event, and 28 candidates were killed during 2016 election cycle alone. Bolsonaro\u2019s insistence that his supporters take aim at Workers\u2019 Party politicians could have deadly consequences.\n\nHis people have taken their cues: In the days before the election, Bolsonaro supporters proudly destroyed memorials to Franco in Rio, and the symbols of American white nationalism \u2015 including a flag of Kekistan, the mythical country created and worshipped by alt-right fanboys in online forums \u2015 began to show up at Bolsonaro rallies. The night of the election, his supporters waved banners commemorating the former Army colonel who carried out the military dictatorship\u2019s torture program.\n\nLGBTQ Brazilians, who are already subject to high rates of violence, are also fearful that Bolsonaro\u2019s aggressive opposition to their rights will give his supporters license to level even more attacks against them. And Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric on policing and public security has only emboldened some of the hard-line officers within Brazil\u2019s police forces, according to locals.\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, a young black writer who lives in a favela on the city\u2019s outskirts told me that he had been stopped by police five times in the first three weeks after the election, usually as he was returning to the neighborhood on the way home from work. In Rio, videos circulated last month of two men lying in the street, shot to death, before the police officers who killed them threw their bodies into the back of a pickup truck. Brazil\u2019s police already killed more than 4,200 people last year \u2015 in Rio, they were responsible for 1 in every 5 homicides across the state. Bolsonaro will likely make police forces even more deadly.\n\nOn this, he will have allies both in and out of politics. Brazilians overwhelmingly support aggressive stances on policing, and amid the violent crime epidemic, more politicians have adopted hard-line stances. Wilson Witzel, the incoming governor of Rio de Janeiro, has said the state will \u201cdig graves\u201d for the bodies of alleged criminals police kill. Newly elected S\u00e3o Paulo Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria, a politician who aligned himself with Bolsonaro during the campaign, has adopted similar rhetoric when it comes to protecting police accused of killing.\n\nBrazil\u2019s institutions may shield its democracy as a whole. But even in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil will almost certainly become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression there, from the state and otherwise.\n\nA Model For \u2018Really Egregious Illiberalism\u2019\n\nThe Independent Bolsonaro modeled his rise to power on Donald Trump's. Now, right-wing politicians across Latin America will likely take lessons from Bolsonaro's victory in Brazil.\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d a woman in S\u00e3o Paulo asked me as our hotel elevator hit the ground floor.\n\nWhen I told her I lived in Washington, D.C., she smiled and turned to her child. In Portuguese, she told him that I was from the same place as Trump.\n\n\u201cEveryone here wants to go there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say all bad things about him, but everyone here wants to move there.\u201d\n\nTo many Brazilians who support Bolsonaro, the chaos Trump has sown and the threats to the tenets of American democracy he poses are nothing to worry about. The U.S. economy, after all, is doing well, and Trump is, in their view, responsible. He\u2019s an outsider who came in and shook up the system, and the establishment just hasn\u2019t learned to cope with that yet.\n\nNow, there are others looking to Bolsonaro. In Uruguay, an upstart presidential candidate is already modeling himself as his country\u2019s version of Bolsonaro; in Argentina, which faces many of the same economic and corruption issues that have plagued Brazil, similar candidates \ufeffcould soon emerge.\n\n\u201cThe political right has not done well in Latin America in the last few decades,\u201d Levitsky, of Harvard, said. \u201cSo right-wing politicians are looking around for a new formula, and illiberalism \u2015 really egregious illiberalism \u2015 may be that formula. If he\u2019s perceived to be successful, it will be reproduced.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro wasn\u2019t the first right-wing authoritarian to put a major democracy under threat. Neither will he be the last.\n\n\u201cWe have Bolsonaro because we have Trump,\u201d Stuenkel said. \u201cWe would not have seen the same dynamic here without what happened in the U.S. in 2016. I think that inspired a lot of people who basically learned from Trump.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Kim Jong Un Says He's Ready To Meet With Trump Again In New Year's Speech", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-jong-un-new-year-speech-trump_us_5c2b249ce4b0407e90856989", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Tuesday he hopes to extend his high-stakes nuclear summitry with President Donald Trump into 2019, but also warned Washington not to test North Koreans\u2019 patience with sanctions and pressure.\n\nDuring his televised New Year\u2019s speech, Kim said he\u2019s ready to meet with Trump at any time to produce an outcome \u201cwelcomed by the international community.\u201d However, he said the North will be forced to take a different path if the United States \u201ccontinues to break its promises and misjudges the patience of our people by unilaterally demanding certain things and pushes ahead with sanctions and pressure.\u201d\n\nKim also said the United States should continue to halt its joint military exercises with ally South Korea and not deploy strategic military assets to the South. He also made a nationalistic call urging for stronger inter-Korean cooperation and said the North is ready to resume operations at a jointly run factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and restart South Korean tours to the North\u2019s Diamond Mountain resort. Neither of those is possible for South Korea unless sanctions are removed.\n\nSome analysts say North Korea has been trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul while putting the larger burden of action on the United States. Pyongyang over the past months has accused Washington of failing to take corresponding measures following the North\u2019s unilateral dismantlement of a nuclear testing ground and suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang are trying to arrange a second summit between Trump and Kim, who met in Singapore on June 12.\n\n\u201cIf the United States takes sincere measures and corresponding action to our leading and pre-emptive efforts, then [U.S.-North Korea] relations will advance at a fast and excellent pace through the process of implementing [such] definite and groundbreaking measures,\u201d said Kim, who delivered the speech sitting on a leather chair, wearing a black suit and gray-blue tie.\n\n\u201cIt is the unwavering position of our party and the republic\u2019s government and my firm will that the two countries as declared in the June 12 joint statement ... take steps to establish a permanent and stable peace regime and push toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we have already declared domestically and internationally and took various actions showing our commitment that we will no further create or test nuclear weapons and will not use or spread them.\u201d\n\nAdam Mount, a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said Kim appears to be hinting at an agreement that falls short of a full disarmament, but could still represent a major limitation of the North Korean threat \u2014 a cap that essentially freezes the North\u2019s rudimentary nuclear capability from growing or advancing further. In exchange, the United States would have to offer major inducements, including sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cU.S. negotiators should move decisively in the new year to find out how far Kim is willing to go toward a verified cap on his arsenal. Discussions on reducing or eliminating that arsenal come later,\u201d Mount said in an email.\n\nHowever, Kim\u2019s statement could prove problematic if there\u2019s ongoing evidence the North\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities continue to run. Private analysts have accused North Korea of continuing nuclear and missile development, citing details from commercial satellite imagery.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, signs of continued work on the arsenal were alarming but not duplicitous, because there was never a commitment to stop those activities,\u201d Mount said. \u201cThat may no longer be true, raising the risk that the White House feels cheated rather than just stonewalled.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s speech also points toward a difficult year for the U.S.-South Korean alliance with their military cooperation coming under pressure from Pyongyang, Seoul\u2019s process for inter-Korean engagement, and Washington\u2019s current inability to reach an agreement on cost-sharing for the U.S. military presence in South Korea. It will be critical for the allies to develop a firmer policy as it\u2019s clear the issue of joint drills is coming to a head, Mount said.\n\nIn the speech, Kim hailed the results of the North\u2019s diplomatic activities in 2018, including his three meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim said an inter-Korean military agreement reached in their last summit in September to reduce conventional military threats was \u201crealistically a non-aggression declaration.\u201d\n\nKim also emphasized the development of the North Korean economy and, without elaborating, mentioned nuclear power as part of the country\u2019s plans to boost electricity production.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government in a statement welcomed what it described as Kim\u2019s commitment toward peace and said Seoul plans to work closely with the international community for the denuclearization of the peninsula while also advancing inter-Korean relations to an \u201cirreversible level.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean leaders traditionally use New Year\u2019s statements to issue major policy goals for the year ahead. Kim used his New Year\u2019s speech a year ago to start a newfound diplomatic approach with Seoul and Washington, which led to his meetings with Moon and Trump. Kim also met three times with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which boosted his leverage by reintroducing Beijing \u2014 Pyongyang\u2019s main ally \u2014 as a major player in the diplomatic process to resolve the nuclear standoff.\n\nBut nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled in recent months as they struggle with the sequencing of North Korea\u2019s disarmament and the removal of U.S.-led sanctions against the North.\n\nThe North has also bristled at U.S. demands to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal.\n\nThe hardening stalemate has fueled doubts on whether Kim will ever voluntarily relinquish the nuclear weapons and missiles he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. In his meetings with Trump and Moon, Kim signed vague statements calling for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. The North used a blunt statement last month to reiterate its traditional stance on denuclearization, saying it will never unilaterally give up its weapons unless Washington removes what Pyongyang describes as a nuclear threat.\n\nThe statement jarred with Seoul\u2019s claim that Kim is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nukes and suggested that the North will potentially demand the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a major sticking point in any disarmament deal."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Bangladesh Opposition Leader Rejects Results Of Election Marred By Violence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bangladesh-opposition-rejects-poll-results-demands-fresh-vote_us_5c28fa9ae4b05c88b701735e", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) \u2015 Bangladesh\u2019s opposition alliance said on Sunday it rejected the results of the country\u2019s general election, alleging rigging and demanding a fresh vote under a neutral government.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s ruling party has taken a big lead over the opposition in the election, early results and trends showed, which has been marred by violence that killed 17 people and allegations of vote rigging.\n\n\u201cWe reject the results and demand a new election under a neutral government,\u201d Kamal Hossain, an octogenarian international jurist who heads the opposition alliance, told a news conference."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Bombs During New Year's Eve Gig, Ends Up Drinking With Fans", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiffany-haddish-new-years-eve-comedy-bomb_us_5c2bab53e4b05c88b7036d68", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Comedian Tiffany Haddish started off the New Year with a bomb, not a bang.\n\nHaddish was hired to do stand-up at Miami\u2019s James L.

He is, however, the founder and face of the provocatively named Church of Safe Injection.\n\nWhat sets the Church of Safe Injection apart from faith-based addiction recovery programs is its insistence on science, a tenet Harvey, who went through the 12-step program a few years ago and is in recovery from addiction to alcohol, opioids and methamphetamine, holds closely. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m sober right now,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cMy recovery was not at all evidence-based,\u201d he added, referring to addiction treatment backed by scientific evidence. \u201cIn fact, a lot of it was evidence-hostile.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso setting it apart: It\u2019s not actually a church.

Each must abide by the organization\u2019s only three rules: Congregations are required to welcome people of all faiths, atheists included; to serve all marginalized people; and, most importantly, to support harm reduction, which involves keeping drug users safe and healthy, instead of focusing solely on getting them into addiction treatment.\n\n\n\nHarvey has plans to incorporate the church as a nonprofit, and then to apply for a religious exemption to the Controlled Substances Act so that he can open a safe injection site, where drug users who aren\u2019t ready for treatment would be able to inject in a clean, safe place, under supervision.\n\n\n\nHis timing couldn\u2019t be more urgent. Drug overdose deaths set a record in 2017, killing more than 70,000 Americans and surpassing other deadly crises like HIV, car crashes and gun violence during their peak years. The majority of those deaths, nearly 49,000 of them, were linked to opioids. Harvey feels certain that the 418 overdose deaths that happened in Maine in 2017 could have been avoided.\n\n\n\nThose who resist instituting these methods of harm reduction argue that these strategies jeopardize public safety and enable more drug use. Research shows that\u2019s not true.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have decades of solutions showing that those deaths can be prevented,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cOur religious belief is simply that people who use drugs don\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe science on needle exchanges is resoundingly clear. Numerous studies, backed by both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicate that these services reduce the transmission of bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, cut down on the number of used needles in public spaces and connect people who use drugs to addiction treatment.\n\n\n\nIn October, Harvey explained his rationale for starting the church in an op-ed he wrote for the Portland Press Herald.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll too often today, people who use drugs are offered only two choices,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet sober or die. Jesus would have rejected this shameful and lethal binary. He\u2019d have been on the front lines providing the third option that Maine and the United States so desperately need: harm reduction. Naloxone, safe injection sites, sterile syringes, the works.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut despite the evidence supporting them, needle exchanges remain controversial, especially in rural areas, where authorized exchanges are sparse. In parts of the southern and western United States, they\u2019re still banned altogether. In Maine, there are only six certified needle exchanges, most of which are clustered in a handful of counties in the southern part of the state, leaving large swaths of drug users in northern Maine without reliable access to clean syringes. There is not one in Lewiston.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closing in on the end of the second decade of this crisis,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re still having these discussions around syringe exchange, especially, is extremely frustrating.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven more controversial are supervised injection sites, which have yet to gain a foothold in the U.S., even in large, progressive cities. Despite research in Europe, Australia and Canada demonstrating their potential to save lives, they remain prohibited under federal law.\n\nNicolas Ortega for HuffPost A lack of public health services in Maine paved the way for experimental initiatives like the Church of Safe Injection.\n\nIf the Church of Safe Injection seems like a ragtag operation with quixotic plans, the authorities aren\u2019t taking it that way.\n\nThe response to Harvey\u2019s efforts was swift.\n\nBy the end of November, the Maine CDC had sent letters with a stern reminder about the rules for mobile exchanges to the organizations that run the state\u2019s certified exchanges. While Harvey wasn\u2019t mentioned in the letter, CDC spokeswoman Emily Spencer confirmed that \u201crecent media coverage of Mr. Harvey\u2019s endeavor\u201d had prompted the letters.\n\nAt the same time, after weeks of turning a blind eye to the uncertified mobile exchange operating less than a block from the police station in Lewiston, the police department warned Harvey that he could be charged with a misdemeanor if he continued to give out free needles.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to possess more than 10 syringes at a time in Maine. If Harvey had followed that law, he would have only legally been able to serve one person per night, he said. Instead, he stocked his trunk with as many as a thousand needles.\n\n\u201c[Harvey] is familiar with the laws and crimes for which he could be charged if he possesses or distributes hypodermic apparatuses,\u201d Lt. David St. Pierre of the Lewiston Police Department told HuffPost in a statement, noting that the department had been in touch with the Maine CDC.\n\nBy all outward appearances, Harvey has complied with the directive to stop distributing syringes out of his car, although he continues to distribute other supplies, including naloxone.\n\nHarvey said he didn\u2019t think the state CDC would approve his application to start a certified exchange because of his criminal record related to his own struggles with addiction, but said the church would exhaust its legal options before knowingly breaking the law. The CDC does take criminal convictions into account when considering applications, though they\u2019re not automatically disqualifying, according to Spencer, the CDC spokeswoman.\n\nAnd Harvey hasn\u2019t ruled out the prospect of civil disobedience in the future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to get arrested than a darling media recovery boy who opened five sober houses and is white, male, heterosexual and cisgender,\u201d he said.\n\nHis knowing bravado recalls a storied history of civil disobedience and activism, dating back to the crusaders who ran illegal needle exchanges during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and \u201990s.\n\n\u201cPublic health innovation has often pushed the boundaries of the law, and the law has followed,\u201d Beletsky said. \u201cOftentimes, public health officials do not lead, they follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the CDC would do more to support harm reduction around the country, instead of getting in the way,\u201d he added.\n\nCivil disobedience paid off in New York City, where in 1991, a judge ruled in favor of a group of activists known as the \u201cNeedle Eight,\u201d who were arrested for trying to distribute free syringes. The threat of AIDS was more damaging than any harm caused by violating the needle possession statute, the judge explained, noting that AIDS was threatening hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\n\u201cThis court is satisfied that the nature of the crisis facing the city, coupled with the medical evidence offered, warranted the defendants\u2019 action,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nOur religious belief is simply that people who use drugs don\u2019t deserve to die. Jesse Harvey, founder of the Church of Safe Injection\n\nBeyond the threat of a CDC crackdown, Harvey and the Church of Safe Injection face an even tougher road ahead in their quest to use religion to skirt the federal rules banning safe injection sites.\n\nResearch from Europe, Canada and Australia, which have operated safe consumption sites for decades, indicates that they may decrease disease transmission, drive down emergency calls and reduce fatal overdoses. But in the United States, action has lagged behind the evidence.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, where Harvey tried to start a conversation about safe injection sites at a city council meeting last year, a city-authorized safe injection site seemed all but off the table. It was that stonewalling at the local level that prompted Harvey to take matters into his own hands, he said.\n\nBigger cities like New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle, are proceeding with plans for supervised consumption sites, even as the Justice Department has vowed swift and aggressive action against any violator of the federal law against injection sites.\n\nYet significant public conversations about safe injection have largely been isolated in a handful of municipalities. \u201c[It\u2019s] evidence that nowhere near enough public health professionals are taking this seriously,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nIn that fraught environment, Harvey sees a religious exemption as an opening. As precedent, he cited a 2006 Supreme Court ruling that found a small religious sect could continue to import ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic tea, for its religious rituals.\n\nEugene Volokh, who teaches religious law at the UCLA School of Law, said that it\u2019s certainly possible for a small religious group to prevail in an exemption case. The 2006 ayahuasca case only included about 130 people in the American branch, he said. But unlike the Church of Safe Injection, that religion was founded in Brazil 45 years before the Supreme Court ruled in the group\u2019s favor. \u201cIt does help if it looks like something that wasn\u2019t just made up for legal purposes,\u201d Volokh said.\n\nPublic health innovation has often pushed the boundaries of the law, and the law has followed. Leo Beletsky, associate professor of law and health science, Northeastern University\n\nIn November, before the police crackdown, a group of volunteers, including a public health worker, a food pantry organizer and a substance abuse counselor who had previously been a street minister, circled up around the trunk of Harvey\u2019s car in the half-light.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to destigmatize public health,\u201d he told them.\n\nAs the night wore on, Harvey and Kandice Child, one of the Church of Safe Injection\u2019s founding members, tag-teamed the slow stream of people picking up supplies, asking them to like the church on Facebook and offering up their services for helping return used needles for disposal. Other volunteers filled paper bags with saline, cotton balls, alcohol wipes, cookers, rubber ties and condoms, logging supplies given out and used needles collected.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get involved and help us do this, I\u2019m really interested in setting up a drug users\u2019 union in Maine,\u201d Harvey told a man picking up supplies. Organizing was less about using drugs and more about advocating for drug users\u2019 health, wellness and safety, he explained, and drug users themselves should be on the front lines of that advocacy.\n\nThe man nodded and tucked Harvey\u2019s business card, identifying him as a \u201cdisciple & acolyte,\u201d into his pocket.\n\n\u201cGod bless,\u201d Child called out as the man receded into the darkness.\n\nAs long as they follow the church\u2019s three basic tenets, the sister branches of the Church of Safe Injection are free to operate as they see fit, and so far, the movement has centered around marrying religious teachings with promoting the rights and safety of drug users.\n\nIn Charles Town, West Virginia, Shannon Hicks, 38, who used IV heroin, cocaine and prescription opioids for nearly two decades, said she felt \u201ccompletely shunned\u201d by her Christian church while she was actively using drugs. \u201cI tried going to church and praying away my addiction,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to do everything that good people did.\u201d When she needed it most, the church abandoned her, and eventually her fellow churchgoers\u2019 hypocrisy ate away at her, she explained.\n\nSo when Hicks saw Harvey wearing a Church of Safe Injection T-shirt at a harm reduction conference this fall, she knew she had to get involved. Days later, she founded her own small branch in Charles Town, which now has around 17 members and a growing Facebook following.\n\nNow when she does peer-to-peer outreach and hands out clean supplies, she tells people about the Church of Safe Injection.\n\n\u201cFor people who are actively using, at first they chuckle and then they really like the idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a church I might actually go to.\u201d\n\nOften, the religious people who are flocking to the church have family members or friends who have been affected by opioids, or have been affected themselves, Harvey said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve seen churches doing enough about this issue.\u201d\n\nLuke, a member of the Church of Safe Injection based in Bangor, Maine, asked not to be identified by his real name because he feared the kind of police crackdown Lewiston was experiencing. \u201cWe\u2019re helping a lot of people and I don\u2019t want folks to be afraid to speak with me,\u201d he said.\n\nLuke works in harm reduction and joined the Church of Safe Injection because he was frustrated that religious people weren\u2019t doing more to help drug users."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "U.S. Strategic Command Apologizes For Joke About Dropping Bombs For New Year's", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/strategic-command-bomb-joke-new-year_us_5c2b1c63e4b0407e908565e7", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. Strategic Command is apologizing for a New Year\u2019s Eve tweet that suggested it was ready to drop a bomb.\n\nThe tweet, since deleted, noted the annual ball drop to ring in the New Year, then said \u201cif ever needed, we are #ready to drop something much, much bigger.\u201d\n\nUS Strategic Command tweeted this and deleted it. 2019 is going to be mental. pic.twitter.com/TKFUVjklts \u2014 Henry Williams (@digitalhen) January 1, 2019\n\nThe tweet featured a video of a B-2 bomber dropping bombs as the words \u201cstealth,\u201d \u201cready\u201d and \u201clethal\u201d flashed on the screen.\n\nThe tweet was deleted and the agency \u2015 which has \u201cPeace is our Profession\u201d in its Twitter bio \u2015 apologized:\n\nOur previous NYE tweet was in poor taste & does not reflect our values.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) said that the wall is simply a \u201cmetaphor\u201d for border security, which would involve a \u201cbarrier where it makes sense.\u201d\n\nBut Trump doubled down on his campaign-promised concrete wall on Monday, saying the idea of an \u201call-concrete wall\u201d has \u201cnever been abandoned.\u201d\n\nAn all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides).

He is, however, the founder and face of the provocatively named Church of Safe Injection.\n\nWhat sets the Church of Safe Injection apart from faith-based addiction recovery programs is its insistence on science, a tenet Harvey, who went through the 12-step program a few years ago and is in recovery from addiction to alcohol, opioids and methamphetamine, holds closely. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m sober right now,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cMy recovery was not at all evidence-based,\u201d he added, referring to addiction treatment backed by scientific evidence. \u201cIn fact, a lot of it was evidence-hostile.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso setting it apart: It\u2019s not actually a church. Or a religion. At least, not yet.\n\n\n\nFar from a brick-and-mortar house of worship, Harvey has been running the \u201cchurch\u201d out of the back of his Honda Fit since October. One night a week, he parks his car by Lewiston\u2019s Kennedy Park, where drug users often congregate, and, along with a group of volunteers, distributes clean needles and Narcan, a brand of the overdose-reversal antidote naloxone, to anyone who stops by. All the while, Harvey preaches that Jesus would have embraced and supported people who use drugs, not shunned them. His philosophy has proven to be an appealing refuge for some religious people, who say they are frustrated that traditional church congregations have turned their backs on the vulnerable in the midst of a drug overdose crisis.\n\n\n\nThose people have taken up Harvey\u2019s cause, establishing 18 branches of the church across eight states. Each must abide by the organization\u2019s only three rules: Congregations are required to welcome people of all faiths, atheists included; to serve all marginalized people; and, most importantly, to support harm reduction, which involves keeping drug users safe and healthy, instead of focusing solely on getting them into addiction treatment.\n\n\n\nHarvey has plans to incorporate the church as a nonprofit, and then to apply for a religious exemption to the Controlled Substances Act so that he can open a safe injection site, where drug users who aren\u2019t ready for treatment would be able to inject in a clean, safe place, under supervision.\n\n\n\nHis timing couldn\u2019t be more urgent. Drug overdose deaths set a record in 2017, killing more than 70,000 Americans and surpassing other deadly crises like HIV, car crashes and gun violence during their peak years. The majority of those deaths, nearly 49,000 of them, were linked to opioids. Harvey feels certain that the 418 overdose deaths that happened in Maine in 2017 could have been avoided.\n\n\n\nThose who resist instituting these methods of harm reduction argue that these strategies jeopardize public safety and enable more drug use. Research shows that\u2019s not true.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have decades of solutions showing that those deaths can be prevented,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cOur religious belief is simply that people who use drugs don\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe science on needle exchanges is resoundingly clear. Numerous studies, backed by both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicate that these services reduce the transmission of bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, cut down on the number of used needles in public spaces and connect people who use drugs to addiction treatment.\n\n\n\nIn October, Harvey explained his rationale for starting the church in an op-ed he wrote for the Portland Press Herald.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll too often today, people who use drugs are offered only two choices,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet sober or die. Jesus would have rejected this shameful and lethal binary. He\u2019d have been on the front lines providing the third option that Maine and the United States so desperately need: harm reduction. Naloxone, safe injection sites, sterile syringes, the works.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut despite the evidence supporting them, needle exchanges remain controversial, especially in rural areas, where authorized exchanges are sparse. In parts of the southern and western United States, they\u2019re still banned altogether. In Maine, there are only six certified needle exchanges, most of which are clustered in a handful of counties in the southern part of the state, leaving large swaths of drug users in northern Maine without reliable access to clean syringes. There is not one in Lewiston.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closing in on the end of the second decade of this crisis,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re still having these discussions around syringe exchange, especially, is extremely frustrating.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven more controversial are supervised injection sites, which have yet to gain a foothold in the U.S., even in large, progressive cities. Despite research in Europe, Australia and Canada demonstrating their potential to save lives, they remain prohibited under federal law.\n\nNicolas Ortega for HuffPost A lack of public health services in Maine paved the way for experimental initiatives like the Church of Safe Injection.\n\nIf the Church of Safe Injection seems like a ragtag operation with quixotic plans, the authorities aren\u2019t taking it that way.\n\nThe response to Harvey\u2019s efforts was swift.\n\nBy the end of November, the Maine CDC had sent letters with a stern reminder about the rules for mobile exchanges to the organizations that run the state\u2019s certified exchanges. While Harvey wasn\u2019t mentioned in the letter, CDC spokeswoman Emily Spencer confirmed that \u201crecent media coverage of Mr. Harvey\u2019s endeavor\u201d had prompted the letters.\n\nAt the same time, after weeks of turning a blind eye to the uncertified mobile exchange operating less than a block from the police station in Lewiston, the police department warned Harvey that he could be charged with a misdemeanor if he continued to give out free needles.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to possess more than 10 syringes at a time in Maine. If Harvey had followed that law, he would have only legally been able to serve one person per night, he said. Instead, he stocked his trunk with as many as a thousand needles.\n\n\u201c[Harvey] is familiar with the laws and crimes for which he could be charged if he possesses or distributes hypodermic apparatuses,\u201d Lt. David St. Pierre of the Lewiston Police Department told HuffPost in a statement, noting that the department had been in touch with the Maine CDC.\n\nBy all outward appearances, Harvey has complied with the directive to stop distributing syringes out of his car, although he continues to distribute other supplies, including naloxone.\n\nHarvey said he didn\u2019t think the state CDC would approve his application to start a certified exchange because of his criminal record related to his own struggles with addiction, but said the church would exhaust its legal options before knowingly breaking the law. The CDC does take criminal convictions into account when considering applications, though they\u2019re not automatically disqualifying, according to Spencer, the CDC spokeswoman.\n\nAnd Harvey hasn\u2019t ruled out the prospect of civil disobedience in the future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to get arrested than a darling media recovery boy who opened five sober houses and is white, male, heterosexual and cisgender,\u201d he said.\n\nHis knowing bravado recalls a storied history of civil disobedience and activism, dating back to the crusaders who ran illegal needle exchanges during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and \u201990s.\n\n\u201cPublic health innovation has often pushed the boundaries of the law, and the law has followed,\u201d Beletsky said. \u201cOftentimes, public health officials do not lead, they follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the CDC would do more to support harm reduction around the country, instead of getting in the way,\u201d he added.\n\nCivil disobedience paid off in New York City, where in 1991, a judge ruled in favor of a group of activists known as the \u201cNeedle Eight,\u201d who were arrested for trying to distribute free syringes. The threat of AIDS was more damaging than any harm caused by violating the needle possession statute, the judge explained, noting that AIDS was threatening hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\n\u201cThis court is satisfied that the nature of the crisis facing the city, coupled with the medical evidence offered, warranted the defendants\u2019 action,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nOur religious belief is simply that people who use drugs don\u2019t deserve to die. Jesse Harvey, founder of the Church of Safe Injection\n\nBeyond the threat of a CDC crackdown, Harvey and the Church of Safe Injection face an even tougher road ahead in their quest to use religion to skirt the federal rules banning safe injection sites.\n\nResearch from Europe, Canada and Australia, which have operated safe consumption sites for decades, indicates that they may decrease disease transmission, drive down emergency calls and reduce fatal overdoses. But in the United States, action has lagged behind the evidence.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, where Harvey tried to start a conversation about safe injection sites at a city council meeting last year, a city-authorized safe injection site seemed all but off the table. It was that stonewalling at the local level that prompted Harvey to take matters into his own hands, he said.\n\nBigger cities like New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle, are proceeding with plans for supervised consumption sites, even as the Justice Department has vowed swift and aggressive action against any violator of the federal law against injection sites.\n\nYet significant public conversations about safe injection have largely been isolated in a handful of municipalities. \u201c[It\u2019s] evidence that nowhere near enough public health professionals are taking this seriously,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nIn that fraught environment, Harvey sees a religious exemption as an opening. As precedent, he cited a 2006 Supreme Court ruling that found a small religious sect could continue to import ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic tea, for its religious rituals.\n\nEugene Volokh, who teaches religious law at the UCLA School of Law, said that it\u2019s certainly possible for a small religious group to prevail in an exemption case. The 2006 ayahuasca case only included about 130 people in the American branch, he said. But unlike the Church of Safe Injection, that religion was founded in Brazil 45 years before the Supreme Court ruled in the group\u2019s favor. \u201cIt does help if it looks like something that wasn\u2019t just made up for legal purposes,\u201d Volokh said.\n\nPublic health innovation has often pushed the boundaries of the law, and the law has followed. Leo Beletsky, associate professor of law and health science, Northeastern University\n\nIn November, before the police crackdown, a group of volunteers, including a public health worker, a food pantry organizer and a substance abuse counselor who had previously been a street minister, circled up around the trunk of Harvey\u2019s car in the half-light.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to destigmatize public health,\u201d he told them.\n\nAs the night wore on, Harvey and Kandice Child, one of the Church of Safe Injection\u2019s founding members, tag-teamed the slow stream of people picking up supplies, asking them to like the church on Facebook and offering up their services for helping return used needles for disposal. Other volunteers filled paper bags with saline, cotton balls, alcohol wipes, cookers, rubber ties and condoms, logging supplies given out and used needles collected.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get involved and help us do this, I\u2019m really interested in setting up a drug users\u2019 union in Maine,\u201d Harvey told a man picking up supplies. Organizing was less about using drugs and more about advocating for drug users\u2019 health, wellness and safety, he explained, and drug users themselves should be on the front lines of that advocacy.\n\nThe man nodded and tucked Harvey\u2019s business card, identifying him as a \u201cdisciple & acolyte,\u201d into his pocket.\n\n\u201cGod bless,\u201d Child called out as the man receded into the darkness.\n\nAs long as they follow the church\u2019s three basic tenets, the sister branches of the Church of Safe Injection are free to operate as they see fit, and so far, the movement has centered around marrying religious teachings with promoting the rights and safety of drug users.\n\nIn Charles Town, West Virginia, Shannon Hicks, 38, who used IV heroin, cocaine and prescription opioids for nearly two decades, said she felt \u201ccompletely shunned\u201d by her Christian church while she was actively using drugs. \u201cI tried going to church and praying away my addiction,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to do everything that good people did.\u201d When she needed it most, the church abandoned her, and eventually her fellow churchgoers\u2019 hypocrisy ate away at her, she explained.\n\nSo when Hicks saw Harvey wearing a Church of Safe Injection T-shirt at a harm reduction conference this fall, she knew she had to get involved. Days later, she founded her own small branch in Charles Town, which now has around 17 members and a growing Facebook following.\n\nNow when she does peer-to-peer outreach and hands out clean supplies, she tells people about the Church of Safe Injection.\n\n\u201cFor people who are actively using, at first they chuckle and then they really like the idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a church I might actually go to.\u201d\n\nOften, the religious people who are flocking to the church have family members or friends who have been affected by opioids, or have been affected themselves, Harvey said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve seen churches doing enough about this issue.\u201d\n\nLuke, a member of the Church of Safe Injection based in Bangor, Maine, asked not to be identified by his real name because he feared the kind of police crackdown Lewiston was experiencing. \u201cWe\u2019re helping a lot of people and I don\u2019t want folks to be afraid to speak with me,\u201d he said.\n\nLuke works in harm reduction and joined the Church of Safe Injection because he was frustrated that religious people weren\u2019t doing more to help drug users."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Will Healthcare Services Decline In Rural North Carolina?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mission-health-rural-hca_us_5c1bbfade4b0535a214bd02f", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "By Taylor Sisk\n\nAs North Carolina\u2019s attorney general deliberates over whether to approve the sale of the nonprofit Mission Health System to for-profit Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA, a citizens group is asking that, if approved, the deal will ensure they have a voice in the future of health care services in their rural communities.\n\nMembers of the citizens group, Sustaining Essential and Rural Community Healthcare, or SEARCH, are worried that the sale will lead to poorer services for patients of Mission Health, which serves 18 mostly rural counties in western North Carolina, in the southern range of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nThe deal with HCA includes the creation of a foundation, Dogwood Health Trust, that will use the proceeds from the proposed $1.5 billion purchase of Mission Health to improve the health and well-being of the communities in those counties.\n\nBut that promise doesn\u2019t ease concerns from residents who want to make sure their views will be heard.\n\n\u201cAll along, we have said that there are two things we want,\u201d said Susan Larson, a member of SEARCH. \u201cWe want our hospitals to be protected, and we want the Dogwood Health Trust to be constituted properly, so that it can indeed serve all 18 counties.\u201d\n\nSEARCH was formed last year when labor and delivery services were discontinued at one of the Mission Health\u2019s hospitals, Blue Ridge Regional, which is located in a town of 2,100 called Spruce Pine and close to the highest peak in Eastern U.S., Mt. Mitchell. Mission Health runs six hospitals, including the flagship facility in the region\u2019s largest city, Asheville (population 90,000).\n\nSEARCH has brought in as a consultant Jay Nixon, former governor of Missouri who, while serving as the state\u2019s attorney general, challenged HCA in courts, charging that the corporation had failed to live up to all of its responsibilities. He brokered a deal that allowed the $1.13 billion sale of Missouri-based nonprofit hospital system, Health Midwest, to HCA if proceeds from the sale would fund two foundations to improve healthcare for the residents in the Kansas City area. HCA later faced a lawsuit from one of the foundations and settled the suit for $160 million in 2017.\n\nNixon\u2019s role for the North Carolina group is to help advocate for an independent health trust that is \u201cgoverned now and in the future by a board and communities that will do what\u2019s best for the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission is a nonprofit and has built up a significant value, obviously, as laid out by the transaction that\u2019s on the table now,\u201d Nixon said.\n\nTax law requires the value of a nonprofit\u2019s assets to remain perpetually nonprofit. When a for-profit healthcare company buys a nonprofit system, one way to keep the proceeds in the nonprofit realm is to create a health care foundation that supports nonprofit work. That\u2019s the plan for the proceeds from the sale of Mission Health\u2019s assets.\n\nHaving reaped the benefits of a nonprofit, Nixon said, Mission Health has a responsibility to taxpayers. \u201cIt\u2019s the community\u2019s money. It\u2019s the state who provided the nonprofit benefits.\u201d\n\nSelecting the best\n\n\u201cPeople in this community have a very long history of feeling that the hospital is ours,\u201d said Jean Hunt, a resident of Yancy County, which is served by Blue Ridge Regional. \u201cWe do not consider that hospital Mission\u2019s. We consider it to be ours.\u201d\n\nBlue Ridge opened in 1955 with significant help from a community fund drive.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is that the foundation isn\u2019t independent,\u201d Hunt said. Thus far, nine members of what is proposed to be a 12- to 15-member Dogwood Health Trust board have been appointed. The majority live in Asheville and eight of the nine have current or previous affiliations with Mission.\n\nThe health trust \u201cvery easily could be the largest per-capita in the country,\u201d said Rowena Buffett Timms, Mission Health\u2019s senior vice president for government and community relations. \u201cWhat you want are the very best that you have to offer in your community to begin setting that up.\u201d\n\nTimms said she has heard the concerns: \u201cPeople went, \u2018Wait a minute, you\u2019ve picked all these people who are or have been on the Mission Health board over the years.\u2019 Absolutely.\u201d Those selected, she said, \u201chave deep pedigree, knowledge of health care, have been intimate with Western North Carolina over the years.\u201d\n\nHunt agreed that such experience is important: \u201cObviously, we need people on board with specific skill sets.\u201d She believes those individuals can also be found in the rural communities.\n\nAs regards Susan Larson\u2019s concern that HCA might close one or more of the regional hospitals,\n\nTo ease concerns about a loss of services after the purchase, HCA\u2019s purchase agreement stipulates that no services will be discontinued for five years, and emergency services must be maintained for 10 \u2013 unless a hospital\u2019s advisory board approves the discontinuance of a service or the sale or closure of a hospital.\n\nThe advisory board at each hospital would have eight members: four appointed by Mission Health, four by HCA.\n\n\u2018Three-comma world\u2019\n\n\u201cI get very concerned about transactions of this nature where you don\u2019t have long-term, ironclad guarantees that the facilities and services will remain open,\u201d Nixon said.\n\n\u201cThe trust, if it could be what they say it\u2019s going to be, could be incredible,\u201d said SEARCH member Risa Larsen. \u201cI love the sound of that trust.\u201d\n\nNixon, too, is big on the potential.\n\n\u201cYou have the opportunity to keep this system as it exists now, which obviously is functioning and is gaining in value,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibrant hospital system.\u201d\n\nBy keeping \u201call the physical assets and the human capital assets\u201d of the existing services and adding the improvements that the foundation promises to deliver, \u201cYou really do have great opportunities.\u201d\n\nThis transaction, Nixon stressed, is \u201cin three-comma world \u2026 a billion dollars. There\u2019s a whole lot of good that can be done if it\u2019s done in a transparent fashion, if it\u2019s done with very solid conflict-of-interest and ethics rules around it and a long-term pipeline of local citizens who understand the particular problems and challenges of the region.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This Is What No One Tells You About Coming Off Antidepressants", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/withdrawing-from-antidepressants_us_5c2a3e2de4b08aaf7a92a7db", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "My relationship with antidepressants began over 20 years ago. Back then, as an anxious teenager crying in my doctor\u2019s office, I had no idea that they would become such an integral part of my life.\n\nI spent a long time wrestling with my need for medication. But you can have as much therapy as you can handle and self-care yourself silly, but for some people, nothing gets rid of that big black cloud \u2014 or at least lifts it enough that you can take a breath \u2014 like a daily pill.\n\nTaking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for clinical depression on a long-term basis wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly, and at various stages I\u2019ve stopped taking them. Maybe my mental health was good and I wanted to see how I got on without the meds. At other times, I succumbed to the stigma and bowed to the pressure inflicted \u2014 be it intentional or not \u2014 by people who proudly declared, \u201cI had depression and got through it without medication!\u201d\n\nThere are a ton of other reasons someone might quit their antidepressants, for example if they couldn\u2019t handle the side effects (commonly reported ones include decreased libido, headaches, insomnia, drowsiness, or simply not feeling like yourself), didn\u2019t think they were working (up to a third of people have treatment-resistant, or refractory, depression), or simply struggled to meet the expense of long-term meds.\n\nAfter several rounds of trial and error, I\u2019ve accepted them as part of my life, and an essential component in my self-care toolkit.\n\nEach time, I ended up back on the medication anyway. Finally, after several rounds of trial and error, I\u2019ve accepted them as part of my life, and an essential component in my self-care toolkit. I also know a few things about what happens when you stop taking them.\n\nThis is an aspect of taking antidepressants I was never told about, despite seeing numerous doctors and working my way through various types of SSRIs. Yes, it\u2019s all there in the small print inside the pill packet, but small print was the last thing I wanted to deal with when simply getting out of bed in the morning was my own personal Everest.\n\nWhat happens when you stop taking antidepressants is commonly referred to as \u201cwithdrawal\u201d symptoms, but this isn\u2019t entirely accurate, according to Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, and author of The Power of Different.\n\n\u201cWithdrawal is a craving for a drug, plus physical symptoms,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhat happens when you stop an antidepressant is known as a discontinuation syndrome, due to the sudden loss of serotonin and/or norepinephrine that had been boosted in the brain by the medication.\u201d\n\nThe first time I stopped taking antidepressants, I followed my doctor\u2019s advice. Over six weeks, I gradually reduced my dose (known as tapering). Initially, I didn\u2019t feel great, but I didn\u2019t feel lousy, either. I had a bit of a headache, nausea, insomnia, and zero energy. A few weeks after stopping my meds completely, I noticed that my anxiety had ramped up, and my low days were more frequent than they had been in a long time. I figured this was an adjustment period, but I was wrong. I was relapsing into depression.\n\nThree months later, I was back on my meds.\n\nIt turns out that some symptoms of discontinuation syndrome \u2014 aside from physical symptoms not commonly found in depression, such as dizziness, flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches, pains, nausea, and abnormal sensations \u2014 can resemble a relapse. However, discontinuation symptoms typically appear very soon after stopping the meds or reducing the dose, whereas relapse symptoms develop later and more gradually.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re more likely to experience discontinuation symptoms if you\u2019ve been taking a certain class of antidepressant, such as an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or a shorter-acting SSRI, like paroxetine (Paxil) or sertraline (Zoloft).\n\nDr. Saltz says tapering slowly makes discontinuation syndrome far less likely to happen, but every time I\u2019ve stopped or reduced my meds through tapering, I\u2019ve still experienced symptoms of discontinuation to some extent.\n\nAnd then there was the time I just ... stopped. No tapering. In my defense, it wasn\u2019t intentional. I was traveling to France with my two young children. I had packed everything we needed for our two-week vacation. Our cases bulged with swimwear, sandals, books, and all manner of things to keep the little people entertained. It wasn\u2019t until I started to unpack, 1,200 miles from home, that I realized something vital was missing from my wash bag.\n\nI arrived home feeling as if all the steps forward I took while I was on medication had been erased from my history; I had taken an enormous leap backward.\n\nSome might say everything\u2019s easier when the out-of-office is turned on and the sun is shining. This doesn\u2019t apply to a sudden stopping of antidepressants. And there was nothing I could do about it but power on through.\n\nThe next week was a blur. I remember crazy dreams, feelings of despair, fear and paranoia, anxiety, tremors, dizziness, and the strangest sensations I\u2019ve ever experienced. I call them \u201cbrain zaps\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re like tiny electric shocks in my brain. I\u2019d had them to a lesser extent during previous (planned) periods of tapering, but this time round they were as unrelenting as the French Riviera midday sun.\n\nApparently, these are caused by an abrupt change in the level of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that attach to receptors on the nerve cells) in the brain, and they\u2019re generally not medically dangerous. But they\u2019re uncomfortable as hell.\n\nI arrived home feeling as if all the steps forward I took while I was on medication had been erased from my history; I had taken an enormous leap backward. I was back to where I started.\n\nI learned an important lesson after that trip. I\u2019ve never forgotten to pack my meds since.\n\nHere\u2019s the main thing I know about coming off antidepressants: it\u2019s a complex process, and it affects everyone differently. It\u2019s up to you when \u2014 or if \u2014 to stop taking antidepressants, but never do it without speaking to your doctor first. In my experience, tapering makes it bearable; stopping suddenly is never going to go well. Don\u2019t quit your meds unless you feel confident that your mental health is good, that you\u2019re functioning well, and that you have the tools and support system to cope with any negative thoughts that might crop up. It\u2019s not a good idea to quit while you\u2019re feeling stressed or going through a major life change, or if you\u2019re only doing it to keep other people happy (perhaps you should quit those people, instead of the meds).\n\nAlso, be aware of the difference between discontinuation syndrome and relapse. And try to stay open-minded, whatever path you take. Some people only need to take antidepressants for a few months; while others do so for several years.\n\nFinally, always, always, remember to pack your pills for your vacation."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Do You Really Know What's In Your Tampons? This Woman Thinks You Should.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tampon-ingredient-law_us_5c290b04e4b0407e9083bd0d", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "On Dec. 12, Kotex voluntarily recalled some of its tampon products for unraveling or breaking apart inside consumers\u2019 bodies. Kimberly-Clark, Kotex\u2019s parent company, said in a press release it received \u201ca small number of reports of infections, vaginal irritation, localized vaginal injury, and other symptoms\u201d and that in some cases consumers had to seek medical attention \u201cto remove tampon pieces left in the body.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there is no federal or state law requiring Kotex, or any other menstrual hygiene company, to share the ingredients \u2014 including the chemicals \u2014 that make up its products. This is a problem, says Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic member of the New York state Assembly. When tampons are falling apart inside people\u2019s bodies, she told HuffPost, doctors should be able to know how to treat these patients. But they\u2019ll struggle to do it if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the problem, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd who knows what the long-term effects are?\u201d Rosenthal asked in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s case in point for why we need ingredient labeling on products people put inside their body.\u201d\n\nRosenthal is sponsoring legislation in New York to require ingredient labeling on the packaging of all menstrual products sold in the state. The Assembly is expected to consider the bill in 2019; if it passes, it will be the first law of its kind in the United States.\n\nManufacturers might list some, but not all, ingredients on feminine hygiene packaging or on their products\u2019 websites.\n\nIn a letter to Kimberly-Clark, the Assembly member asked the company to \u201cpublicly disclose the chemicals present in these products so that menstruators can work with their health care providers to properly manage risks associated with exposure.\u201d She has yet to receive a response.\n\nBrett Carlsen via Getty Images Linda Rosenthal of the New York state Assembly wants to make it mandatory for tampon companies to disclose the ingredients they use in their products.\n\nRosenthal isn\u2019t alone in her fight. In 2017, for example, the Menstrual Products Right to Know Act was introduced in Congress, though it later stalled.\n\n\u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said. She fears these products contains an array of chemicals that \u201cmore and more people are becoming sensitive to.\u201d\n\nA recent study commissioned by the organization Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth detected chemicals like carbon disulfide, a known reproductive toxin, and methylene chloride, a potential occupational carcinogen, in popular tampon brands. These ingredients are not disclosed on product packaging. (WVE, it should be noted, partners with two menstrual product brands, Seventh Generation and Natracare, both of which appeared free of chemicals in the testing.)\n\nThis is not the only study on menstrual products and potential contaminants, but research into the topic is limited. There are also conflicting opinions on what is considered \u201csafe\u201d when it comes to the levels of chemicals in these products. Trace amounts of dioxin, a chemical that has been associated with endometriosis, have been deemed \u201csafe\u201d by the Food and Drug Administration, The New York Times reported in 2017. Manufacturers are required to assess the dioxin levels in their products on their own, and then provide the FDA with their results.\n\nSome experts worry that the harmfulness of dioxin could be greater than is widely assumed. Carolyn Nygaard, a naturopathic physician, told The Guardian in 2016 that she is unsure of the chemical\u2019s effects on women\u2019s health over time, and isn\u2019t confident the FDA considers this. Women menstruate for up to 40 years, Nygaard told The Guardian, wearing up to 20 tampons once a month, 13 times a year. \u201cSo there is the potential to have cumulative effects from that,\u201d she said. The vaginal membrane is more absorptive than skin on other parts of the body, which raises specific concerns around chemicals like dioxin in products meant to be inserted vaginally, the publication noted.\n\nPhotographyFirm via Getty Images \u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said.\n\nRosenthal is a pioneer in fronting legislation for fair treatment of people who menstruate.\n\nIn March 2018, she introduced the Total Access to Menstrual Products Act to the Assembly. The TAMP Act would require all female-designated bathrooms in the state of New York to provide hygiene products at no cost.\n\n\u201cToilet paper is assumed in every bathroom,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cWhy should there not be products to help half the population deal with their biological function? It doesn\u2019t make sense. If you can expect toilet paper, you should be able to expect menstrual products.\u201d\n\nRosenthal also helped spearhead a bill that would require state correctional facilities to provide incarcerated people with menstrual products at no cost. The bill passed.\n\nUltimately, Rosenthal said, laws relating to menstrual health will help to reduce the stigma and shame that surrounds the topic.\n\nThe fight for these types of legal actions underscores how desperately we need more women in power, Rosenthal added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

Their approach will have significant ramifications for American companies, workers and consumers whose fortunes, whether Mr. Trump likes it or not, are increasingly tied to China.\n\nFirst, however, Mr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline since 2008. Despite his declaration that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win\u201d and his recent boast that he is a \u201cTariff Man,\u201d Mr. Trump is increasingly anxious to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Democrats Try to Box In Trump With Plan to End Government Shutdown Without Wall Funding", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/government-shutdown-democrats-house.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "In a tweet Monday night, he added that \u201csome things NEVER get better\u201d over time: \u201cYou have Walls and you have Wheels.

She couldn\u2019t produce milk in the fetid space. \u201cThe smell, it messed with me,\u201d she said.\n\nSo Ms. Dundlow hung baby blankets from the windows of her Ford Expedition. Three times a day, she came out to express. Occasionally, she said, she had to explain the situation to a security guard who tapped on her window, wanting to know what was going on inside.\n\nSometimes, she didn\u2019t have time to take the quarter-mile walk from one end of the prison to her S.U.V. On those occasions, painfully engorged, she would take a sterile cup normally used to collect urine samples, go to the bathroom and express milk by squeezing her breasts. Then she would hand the cup to her husband, who was also employed at the prison, as a correctional officer. He would take it to a cooler in their car.\n\nAfter both women spent months expressing in the parking lot, Ms. Van Son decided she had had enough. Bone-tired and out of patience, she decided to smuggle her pump past the security checkpoint.\n\n\u201cTonight\u2019s the night,\u201d she told herself. She brought in the manual pump\u2019s pastel-yellow handle first. Before dawn, she got her co-worker to bring in the bulky spout. The next night, Ms. Van Son hid a number of smaller parts in her bra, and the night after that she maneuvered an adapter that let her use plastic bags instead of bottles under her breasts and walked it past the guards.\n\nHer mission accomplished, she pumped for months in the relatively blissful privacy of the prison\u2019s pharmacy and stored the milk in the refrigerator there. She had no trouble carting her milk out of the prison in the brown paper bags that inmates\u2019 medication came in.\n\nMs. Van Son stopped working at the prison a few months later. She was never caught.\n\n\u201cI tried to do it the right way and I was met with zero response,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to do what I had to do to continue pumping.

For older adults alone, this increased health care costs by 46 percent over a period of 10 years, compared with costs incurred by those without hearing loss, the authors reported in November in JAMA Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nOne of the authors, Jennifer A. Deal, an epidemiologist and gerontologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while \u201chearing loss itself is not very expensive, the effect of hearing loss on everything else is expensive.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, people tend to wait much too long to get their hearing tested and treated with hearing aids, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to treat hearing loss, Dr. Lin told me.\n\nAge-related hearing loss comes on really slowly, making it harder for people to know when to take it seriously, he said. He cited two good clues to when to get your hearing tested: Family members or close friends say you should, or you notice that you often mishear or don\u2019t know what others are saying.\n\nBut even when people are tested and spend thousands of dollars to purchase needed hearing aids, the devices often sit in a drawer. People may complain that the sound quality is poor, too static-y or otherwise annoying, and that the aids merely amplify all sound, making it still hard to hear in a noisy environment. All aids are not created equal, Dr. Lin said, and even expensive, properly fitted aids can require multiple adjustments. Some people give up too readily to get the best results.\n\n\u201cUnrealistic expectations are a big part of this problem,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting on a pair of glasses that immediately enables you to see clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing loss is not fixed as easily as eyesight. The brain needs time \u2014 a good month or two \u2014 to adjust to hearing aids. And the earlier hearing loss is treated, the easier it is for the brain to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe new studies give ample cause for taking hearing loss seriously. Consider, for example, the link to dementia. People who can\u2019t hear well often become socially isolated and deprived of stimuli that keep the brain cognitively engaged.

In my own work, I do my best to remain conscious of these subtle forces and how they may operate, but it\u2019s a continuing battle.\n\nGetting positive results, or successfully completing projects, can sometimes feel like the only way to achieve success in research careers. Just as those drivers can lead people to publish those results, it can also nudge them not to publish null ones.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I\u2019ve been acutely aware of concerns that relationships between formula companies and the American Academy of Pediatrics might be influencing policies on feeding infants. But biases can occur even without direct financial contributions.\n\nIf an organization has spent decades recommending low-fat diets, it can be hard for that group to acknowledge the potential benefits of a low-carb diet (and vice versa). If a group has been pushing for very low-sodium diets for years, it can be hard for it to acknowledge that this might have been a waste of time, or even worse, bad advice."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: Marburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/health/marburg-virus-fruit-bats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 19:02:01", "body_paragraphs": "The Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, has been isolated in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the first time it has been found in West Africa.\n\nFive bats caught in three health districts tested positive for the virus, according to two teams of scientists. One was led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Sierra Leone\u2019s Njala University, and the second by the University of California, Davis, and Sierra Leone\u2019s University of Makeni.\n\nEgyptian rousette fruit bats are known to harbor the virus elsewhere in Africa, \u201cso it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019d find the virus in bats there\u201d in West Africa, said Jonathan S. Towner , an ecological diseases specialist who led the C.D.C. team.\n\nThe testing was done as part of a relatively new American-led effort to spot dangerous pathogens lurking in animals and take steps to prevent them from crossing over into humans and triggering lethal outbreaks."}]
