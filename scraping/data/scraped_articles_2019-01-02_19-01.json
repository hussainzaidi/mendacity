China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.\n\nTaiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrives for a press conference at the Presidential Palace after the national flag raising ceremony in Taipei on January 1, 2019.\n\nCross-strait tensions\n\nXi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address , in which she called on Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to \"respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\"\n\nWhile she acknowledged the elections were a \"serious test for the current government,\" Tsai said the results \"absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.\"\n\nShe also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's \"attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Xi said China had \"achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities.\"\n\nLev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.\n\n\"I am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections,\" he said. \"This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'.\"\n\nNachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing \"now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path.\"\n\n\"If the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force,\" he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.\n\nA group of Hong Kong independence supporters display flags during the annual New Year's Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on January 1, 2019.\n\nHong Kong model\n\nThroughout his speech -- and those of other Chinese officials introducing him -- Xi pointed to \"One Country, Two Systems\" as the model for Taiwanese reunification.\n\nThat is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.\n\n\"One Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots ... under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security,\" Xi said.\n\nHow attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election . Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.\n\n\"Xi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely,\" Nachman said.\n\n\"Xi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not.\"\n\nSpeaking in Taipei Wednesday following Xi's speech, Tsai said the island would not accept a Hong Kong-style arrangement, and called on Beijing to respect Taiwan's political sovereignty.\n\n'No promise to renounce force'\n\nWhile Xi's speech was conciliatory, emphasizing the need for \"peaceful reunification\" above all else, he did not rule out military force if Taiwan were to pursue de jure as well as its longtime de facto independence.\n\n\"We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,\" he said.\n\n\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,\" he said, adding that the \"issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable.\"\n\nWhile it does not formally recognize Taiwan, the US maintains strong ties with Taipei, which have been bolstered under US President Donald Trump."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "6 killed in train accident on Danish bridge", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/MIe-k6LYwoc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) Six people were killed and 16 injured when a crowded commuter train and a truck trailer that apparently fell from a freight train collided on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, authorities said.\n\nThe rail accident, which is one of the deadliest in Danish history, took place at about 7:30 a.m. (1:35 am ET) Wednesday in high winds on a bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen.\n\nBo Haaning, of the Danish Accident Investigation Board, confirmed to CNN that the trailer had fallen off the freight train and hit the passenger train, but said it was not yet known whether this caused the accident or happened during it.\n\nThe freight train was carrying Carlsberg beer, a spokesman for the brewing company, which has its headquarters in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, told CNN.

By Friday, he was with the wedding party at the Kremlin, acting as a tour guide, his brother said.\n\nWhen Paul didn't arrive at the wedding later Friday, the newlyweds filed a missing-person report with Russian authorities, the brother told CNN.\n\nThe family learned about Paul's detention Monday morning through media reports, David Whelan said.\n\nPaul hadn't expressed any concern about his trip, the brother said.\n\n\"Paul was mostly worried about the family golden retriever who (had) a vet appointment last week, and about his parents slipping on the ice in the Michigan winter. He was not concerned about his trip to Russia,\" David Whelan said.\n\nMilitary tours in Iraq, and corporate security work\n\nWhelan was born in Canada to British parents, but is a US citizen living in Novi, Michigan. He served 14 years in the US Marine Corps Reserve and completed two tours in Iraq, in 2004 and 2006.\n\nThe onetime staff sergeant's service with the Reserve ended in 2008, when he was convicted at a court-martial on \"several charges related to larceny,\" Marine Corps records show. He received a bad-conduct discharge with a rank of private.\n\nHe's had a career in corporate security, his brother said, including at BorgWarner since 2017.\n\nWhelan's job entails making sure BorgWarner facilities are physically secure -- that they can't be stolen from or broken into -- his brother says. The company confirms his employment, but notes BorgWarner has no facilities in Russia.\n\nWhelan worked for Kelly Services -- a US-based, global office staffing company -- until 2016, company spokeswoman Jane Stehney said.\n\nThe Security Magazine article said Whelan's job at Kelly Services involved, in part, preventing workplace violence\n\nFriends and trips in Russia\n\nFew details about Whelan's previous travels to Russia were immediately available. But he's no stranger to the country, having been there several times for work and personal business, his brother said.\n\nDuring his 2006 Iraq tour with the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, he even used his two weeks' leave to visit Russia.\n\n2007 online Marine Corps article says he spent the leave \"experiencing the post-Soviet era of Moscow and St. Petersburg.\" An attached photo shows him standing across the Moscow River from the Kremlin.\n\nPaul Whelan spent two weeks' military leave in Russia in 2006, according to an article posted on the US Marine Corps website. This photo accompanying the article shows Whelan in front of the Kremlin during that trip.\n\nIt also appears that Whelan had been using a Russian social media platform similar to Facebook for the past 13 years.\n\nPhotos showing Whelan have been uploaded to the VKontakte (VK) social network from around the world for years, in a profile under his name.\n\nThe last status update on the page reads \"next stop, Moscow...\"\n\nWhelan appears to have posted several comments in Russian last year, including one congratulating the Russian people for \"Victory Day,\" the day of Nazi surrender in 1945, and another one wishing a merry Christmas.\n\nThe page shows that someone last logged into the profile under Whelan's name on Friday, the same day Russian officials said he was arrested in Moscow.\n\nWhen asked about the VKontakte page, Whelan's brother said he couldn't confirm the account, but accepts that he likely had one, because he had made friends in the country.\n\n\"I knew over the years he had met Russians,\" David Whelan told CNN Wednesday. \"I don't know whether it was through work or through his Marine activity. But he'd met people while he'd been traveling around, and he connected with them on social media. And he would tell us that when he was traveling he would go visit those people.\"\n\nYet the brother said he didn't know \"that Russia was specifically a place he'd like to go.\"\n\n\"He liked to travel wherever he could. He was been to India and Iceland, all over the place. He has friends in Russia, so that would be an extra draw, people he's met on social media, but I don't know that Russia was a particular place of return for him,\" David Whelan said.\n\nIs this retaliation for Butina prosecution?\n\nThe timing of Whelan's arrest has raised speculation about whether it had anything to do with Maria Butina's legal troubles in the US.\n\nUntil her December plea deal, Butina maintained she was innocent and insisted she was a foreign student interested in bettering relations between the US and Russia. Russian officials have said they view her as a political prisoner who did nothing wrong and had been targeted for political motivations.\n\nCNN asked Samantha Vinograd, who served on President Barack Obama's National Security Council from 2009 to 2011, whether Whelan's arrest is a Russian government response to Butina's legal problems in the US.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin certainly likes to take what he calls reciprocal measures, and in this case, ostensibly he would want to have some kind of bargaining chip if he chooses to try to negotiate for Maria Butina's release,\" Vinograd, a CNN national security analyst, told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Tuesday.\n\nTony Blinken, a former deputy US national security adviser and a CNN analyst, said Whelan's arrest looked like Russia's attempt at a \"tit-for-tat.\"\n\n\"We've gone after various Russians for spying in one way or another on the United States, and what they'll do in response, and other countries have done in response, is just arbitrarily pick up someone who isn't responsible or guilty of anything, just to create pressure and leverage on us,\" Whelan told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\"That's what this looks like, for now.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Toddler rushed to hospital after rhino encounter at Florida zoo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/QvyojOZUw3o/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A 2-year-old girl remains in the hospital a day after she was injured at a Florida zoo during a private rhino encounter experience, zoo officials and her family said.\n\nThe toddler and her family were taking part Tuesday in a close-up experience with white rhinos at the Brevard Zoo in Melbourne, Florida, when the girl came into contact with the animals.\n\nThe family of three was given access to feel and brush the rhinos while supervised by two zookeepers in an area of the zoo where they were separated from the animals only by steel posts.

And what he wrote was deeply critical of the way in which Trump has approached the presidency. Of Trump, Romney wrote: \"His conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the President has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nThe Romney op-ed , which ran in The Washington Post, got A LOT of attention -- as he (and we) knew it would. And Trump responded -- \"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!\" -- as he (and we) knew he would.\n\nIt was all a Very Big Deal.\n\nBut here's the thing: I am very skeptical that any of this matters at all -- in terms of how Trump conducts himself and/or how the elected Republican leaders in Washington interact and react to him.\n\nThe first observation is patently obvious to anyone who has watched Trump's presidency -- or his life. He is who he is. The chances a 70+-year-old man who is currently the President of the United States changes his approach to life because a politician who has long been a critic writes an op-ed are, roughly, 0%.\n\nIf you need proof of that -- and if the first two years of Trump's presidency aren't proof enough -- simply look to his tweeted response to Romney's op-ed -- in which he urges the soon-to-be Utah senator to \"be a TEAM player & WIN!\"\n\nThe second thought -- that Romney's op-ed will change nothing about how Republican senators and House members interact with Trump -- is also based on recent observations.\n\nTake Romney. Yes, he was the most high-profile critic of Trump -- at least among those Republicans not running against him -- during the 2016 primary race. Romney gave a speech during the spring of 2016 in which he blasted Trump, saying, among other things, that \"dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark.\"\n\nAnd yet, after Trump won, Romney met with him when the President was apparently weighing naming the former Massachusetts governor as secretary of state. While Romney was occasionally critical of Trump during the 2018 Senate campaign, he said and did nothing even close to as overt as this Post op-ed when it could have hurt him electorally.\n\nRomney's record of opposition to Trump is not entirely consistent, to put it nicely. Who's to say that he will keep it up for the next two years (or longer)?\n\nEven if Romney does keep it up, there's reason for skepticism that his critique of Trump's approach to the presidency will have any actual impact on his colleagues. Over the past two years, Trump had several prominent Republican critics in the Senate -- Jeff Flake, John McCain and Bob Corker being the three best known. This is not a thank-God-someone-finally-said-it! sort of moment.\n\nFlake was driven into retirement by his anti-Trump views. Corker's political strength was affected as well, and he decided not to run again. McCain, afflicted with terminal brain cancer, passed away last year.\n\nAnd for all of their speaking out and appealing to the better angels within their colleagues' hearts and minds, Flake, McCain and Corker had zero measurable impact on rallying the Senate (or the House) against Trump.\n\nIf anything, they served as examples of what not to do -- challenge Trump and watch your base run away from you, never to come back.\n\nThe Republican Party -- as reflected by its elected officials in the House and Senate -- became more pro-Trump between the end of 2016 and the end of 2018. It did so for a variety of reasons, the main ones being: 1) to accomplish long-standing goals like a major tax cut or the confirmation of a slew of judges from the Supreme Court on down 2) to survive politically.\n\nThe belief that op-eds like Romney's might change things within the Republican establishment are, therefore, based on a false premise: That there is any sort of measurable Republican Party outside of those who align with Trump.\n\nThere is not. The 2018 election showed that. The path to victory for Republican candidates -- particularly in GOP primaries -- was to get as close to Trump as possible and never let go. Distancing yourself from the President was a recipe for Republican disaster.\n\nRomney's op-ed is then rightly understood not as a political earthquake but as a lone scream into the void. Sure, Trump has flatly rejected the idea of the presidency as a position of moral leadership. And yes, his policies are a clear break from what the GOP stood for even a few years ago.\n\nBut the idea that an op-ed will change how Romney's soon-to-be Republican colleagues will act toward Trump between now and the 2020 election is a total and complete fallacy. That ship sailed a long time ago. And no words written in a Washington Post op-ed are going to bring it back into harbor."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Harry Reid: Trump is 'amoral' and 'the worst president we've ever had'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/aYUO89dbvSc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called President Donald Trump an \"amoral\" person and said he's \"the worst President we've ever had\" in an interview with The New York Times Magazine published Wednesday.\n\n\"Trump is an interesting person.

It's a strip that allows people who use street drugs such as cocaine and heroin to test whether their drugs are laced with fentanyl.\n\nIf the drugs test positive, they might choose not to use them or choose to use less of them.\n\nAccording to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , fentanyl is now the deadliest drug in America and was linked to nearly 29% of all overdose deaths in 2016. The synthetic opioid is about 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and produces a powerful high. It's cheap and sometimes mixed into street drugs without the buyer even knowing. Given its potency, it can be deadly.\n\nFentanyl test strip technology was originally developed by a Canadian biotech company BTNX to test urine samples for the presence of the drug, but the strips work basically the same way when they're dipped in the residue of cooked heroin or when a little water is added to empty baggies of cocaine.\n\nIt works like a pregnancy test in reverse. One line on the strip suggests that the drugs are positive for fentanyl. Two lines is interpreted as a negative result.\n\nIn a study , researchers at Johns Hopkins and Brown University determined that the test strips worked to detect even low concentrations of fentanyl in street drugs.\n\n\"Our findings bring to the table evidence that can inform a public health approach to the fentanyl crisis. Smart strategies that reduce harm can save lives,\" Susan Sherman, a co-author on the study, said in a news release\n\nAccording to the study, several programs in the United States that distribute clean syringes to people who use drugs have started to distribute fentanyl test strips, as well.\n\nIn Los Angeles County , emergency departments, first responders and other heath care workers have been advised to discuss the potential risks and benefits of the strips with patients who use street drugs.\n\nThe test strips aren't 100% effective at eliminating the risk of overdose, since they don't identify all forms of fentanyl and can produce false negatives. They also don't let users know how much fentanyl the drugs contain.\n\nStill, the researchers see an opportunity to halt the increase in fentanyl-related overdose deaths.\n\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in the overdose epidemic, and we need to embrace the full range of interventions that can save lives,\" Sherman said.\n\nIn a video , the Urban Survivor's Union, an organization that advocates on behalf of drug users, offers instructions on how to use the strips and what to do if the results are positive.\n\n\"Let's say you had some drugs you were going to inject. ... If it tests positive, you have options,\" the video explains. \"One, you can shoot half back into another sterile syringe, which may not only be life-saving but also cost-effective. Or two, you may even choose not to do it.\"\n\nThe concept of drug checking has jarred some.\n\nThe Trump administration's assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for mental Health and substance use, Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, has expressed ardent opposition to the use of the fentanyl test strips.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn a blog post , Katz laid out several reasons.

About four months ago, desperate to be near relatives and longing for small-town life again, they moved to Indiana.\n\nThey picked a home on about 2 acres of land, down rural country roads and tucked between cornfields. They wanted a spot to give the family space, to let the boys grow and prosper and to allow their older brother, Aza, 5, to thrive on his own.\n\nJadon plays with letters of the alphabet during a physical therapy session.\n\n\"I had reached a point where I couldn't do it anymore,\" Nicole said. \"I needed my mom. I needed just anyone who could come in my house and help me, because it was getting too hard.\n\n\"I needed to go home. The boys needed it, and Aza needed it.\"\n\nAll of that is on display as Aza flies around the house, hiding soft rubber letters for Jadon to pick up as if on a scavenger hunt. Jadon and Aza even ride the school bus together to attend day care.\n\n\"Jadon and Aza are both in school, and Anias goes to preschool one day a week,\" Christian said. \"So we're trying to be a normal family.\"\n\nWhen twins are joined at the head, one tends to be more dominant. In this case, Jadon was the dominant one, whose body worked overtime to keep both of them alive.\n\nJUST WATCHED A 360\u00b0 look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery Replay More Videos ...

He used a breathing machine to keep him alive and other equipment was hooked up to him to monitor his vitals.\n\nAnias faced major setbacks over the past year. He stopped rolling. He stopped playing with toys. He stopped lifting his head because so much fluid had built around his brain it weighed him down.\n\n\"It was horrific for me to watch,\" Nicole says. Anias had not \"just stopped development, but regressed in development.\"\n\nHe also developed eczema so bad, his mother says, his legs and ankles were like \"raw meat.\" He started having seizures so severe that he'd turn blue up to 15 times a day.\n\n\"I thought I was losing him forever, and I was devastated,\" Nicole said.\n\nBut he recently had his tonsils and adenoids removed, allowing him to breathe on his own and freeing him from the array of medical equipment that was hooked up to him. Since then, the parents have seen a vast improvement. He's begun lifting his head and using his hands and feet in ways he couldn't before -- a spark of hope after a year of heartache.\n\nOn the fridge, the family displays a hand-splattered painting by Anias, titled by his parents. \"Painted this with the right hand that I'm not supposed to be able to use,\" it says.\n\n\"Anias had like Mount Everest medically,\" Nicole said. \"That's what I've started to appreciate is, he climbed his medical mountain.\"\n\nChristian said, \"He's making progress. It's just slow. But it's there, every day.\"\n\n'You just want him to fly'\n\nWhen CNN last visited, the boys were closer in their progress, considering that the surgery had set them back to infancy in many ways. They had to learn how to sit up, crawl and do the other things every baby learns. Anias was a few months behind Jadon developmentally, but it seemed he was on track to catch up. He was able to roll and clap his hands.\n\nAnias lost most of his function over the last year, but his parents say they've begun to see major progress in the past few weeks.\n\n\"What was hard was to see that he was on the same path as Jadon, and then something happened -- lots of things happened -- to pull him out of that race for a minute,\" Nicole said. \"I feel like I'm constantly fighting for the Anias I know.\"\n\nAs a mom, she says, \"you just want him to fly, and he's still stuck on the ground. That was really difficult, but we just had this ray of hope, like in the last month.\n\n\"That's lifts us both,\" she said, \"and we're ready to help him take off.\n\n\"He's the most medically stable he's ever been. He's getting stronger every day,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see a huge change in him over this next year.\"\n\nShe's determined to see Anias become the boy she believes he can be. She tells him things like \"someday, you're going to sit up. Someday, you're going to walk to me.\" He often smiles at her encouraging words.\n\nBoth parents say they are focused in the moment, simply trying to enjoy their boys and relishing their growth.\n\nNicole says she will never stop advocating and fighting for her boys.\n\n\"The boys, they may not be perfectly normal little boys like you and me,\" Christian said. \"But that doesn't mean they can't have a great life.\"\n\nHe says he and his wife used to worry about things like whether the boys' hair would grow back enough to cover the scars on their heads from the various surgeries. But now, they now intentionally cut their hair short: \"They earned those scars. You know, they can be proud of them.\"\n\nAt the family table, Nicole recounts a story of Jadon spilling a drink at lunch and how he put her at ease, saying, \"Mommy, it's just an accident.\" She says he then looked at her and said, \"I am smart.\" She laughed and told him, \"You are smart.\" Nicole was still laughing when Jadon added, \"I am funny.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs she tells this story, Jadon looks at her attentively.

police station) and detain them under Section 136 of the act\n\nThe detained person is then assessed by an approved mental health professional and a doctor and can be held for up to 72 hours - during which time a decision will be made as to whether further detention (of up to six months) under the act is necessary\n\nDetention under the act means someone can be medically treated against their will, but protects them from being questioned by police, as they are deemed unfit for interview\n\nSource: NHS\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said the use of the Mental Health Act to detain the suspect did not stop it \"from being a terror attack, particularly for the people involved\".\n\n\"The big question is why would somebody who has got a mental illness be inspired or incited... to carry out an attack,\" he said.\n\n\"What we know is that people who perhaps have an existing problem in their lives... are particularly vulnerable to be targeted, to be radicalised, and that is why there is much closer working between police and the mental health agencies [while] always respecting patient confidentiality.\""}, {"site": "bbc",

thought to be the type-2 version of the condition - and his GP was concerned enough about the results to send him to the hospital for further tests.\n\nThere they found he was severely dehydrated and had to give him three and a half litres of saline to rehydrate him.\n\n\"That routine test probably saved my life,\" he said.\n\nAlistair Burns, national clinical director for dementia and older people's mental health for NHS England, said: \"Heart disease and dementia are two of the biggest health risks facing people in our country.\n\n\"Attending a free NHS health check is a great opportunity to discuss existing health conditions, and to work out how to reduce the risk of developing dementia and other illness in the future.\"\n\nHe said the start of a new year was the right time to commit to \"taking a simple, free and potentially life-saving step towards a healthier life\".\n\nPublic Health England said the check looked at the top causes of premature death and ill health and supported people to take action to reduce their risks."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Child health record 'red book' to go online", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46701196", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The personal child health record -

As a result, there will continue to be some anxiety until the data can be examined.\n\n\"The highest resolution images taken at closest approach required perfect pointing, almost,\" said Project Scientist Hal Weaver. \"We think, based on everything we've seen so far, that was achieved.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Taken from a few hundred thousand km: A last image on approach to the target\n\nOther stories on the BBC you might like:\n\nUltima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe vast separation between New Horizons and Earth, coupled with the probe's small, 15-watt transmitter, mean data rates are glacial, however.\n\nThey top out at 1 kilobit per second. To retrieve all of the imagery stored on the probe is therefore expected to take until September 2020.\n\nThe first of the very highest resolution pictures should come down to Earth in February. But this wouldn't delay the science, said Principal Investigator Alan Stern.\n\n\"The [lower resolution] images that come down this week will already reveal the basic geology and structure of Ultima for us, and we're going to start writing our first scientific paper next week,\" he told reporters.\n\nEven just the final picture released from the approach phase to the flyby contained tantalising information. Ultima appears in it as just a blob, but immediately it has allowed researchers to refine their estimate of the object's size - about 35km by 15km.\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 30km across), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nAlan Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Chang'e-4: China mission primed for landing on Moon's far side", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46724727", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An employee inspects a 1:8 scale model of the Chang'e-4 lunar probe\n\nChina is preparing to make the first attempt at landing robotic spacecraft on the Moon's far side.\n\nA static lander and rover are expected to be deployed to the surface in the next day, state media reports.\n\nThe vehicles are carrying a suite of instruments designed to characterise the region's geology, as well as a biological experiment.\n\nIn recent days, the Chang'e-4 spacecraft had lowered its orbit in preparation for landing.\n\nAt the weekend, Chinese state media said the probe had entered an elliptical path around the Moon, bringing the vehicles to within 15km (9 miles) of the lunar surface at its closest point.\n\nAuthorities have not specified the exact time of the attempt to touch down in the Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater. But a report in the state-run China Daily newspaper suggests Chang'e-4 could begin descending on its thrusters sometime from 2-3 January.\n\nTargeting the far side turns this mission into a riskier and more complex venture than its predecessor, Chang'e-3 - which touched down in the Moon's Mare Imbrium region in 2013. But China's latest moon shot will pave the way for the country to deliver samples of lunar rock and dust to Earth.\n\nAndrew Coates, professor of physics at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey, told BBC News: \"This daring mission will land nearly 50 years on from the historic Apollo landings and will be followed in late 2019 by a Chinese sample return mission.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The near side (L) and far side (R) of the Moon have some key differences\n\nBecause of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one \"face\" of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThe lunar far side is often referred to as the \"dark side\", though \"dark\" in this case means \"unseen\" rather than \"lacking light\". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and night-time.\n\nBut the far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the \"mare\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nThe Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater is located within a much larger feature - the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history.\n\n\"This huge structure is over 2,500km in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,\" Prof Coates told me.\n\nAnd therein lies the scientific interest. The event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the outer layer of the Moon, known as the crust, and down into the zone called the mantle. Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity.\n\nImage copyright CNSA Image caption Artwork: The Chang'e-4 rover will explore a huge impact basin on the far side\n\nImage copyright CNSA Image caption Artwork: The lander and the rover were originally built as back-ups for a previous Moon mission\n\nThe science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin, allowing them to identify variations in its composition.\n\nA third objective is to study the far side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface.\n\n\"The in-situ composition information in particular will be hugely valuable in understanding the formation of the Moon,\" Andrew Coates commented.\n\nLanding challenge\n\nUp until now, China has followed in the footsteps of US and Soviet missions, carefully building up its capabilities. But this mission marks a first for any space agency.\n\nThe rugged character of the far side, with its undulating topography, poses particular challenges for landing the vehicles safely.\n\nTouching down on a jagged outcrop would spell instant mission failure - and be a significant setback for the Chinese exploration programme.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China\n\nThe selection of the Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater as the landing site owes much to the fact that it's flatter than any spot in the South Pole-Aitken basin, according to Chinese scientists.\n\nThe descent to the lunar surface is split into six phases. The first three - initial deceleration, quick attitude and reorientation adjustment, and approach - will be controlled from Earth.\n\nFor the final three - hovering, hazard avoidance, and slow descent - the lander will take over, assuming autonomous control.\n\nSeeds and eggs\n\nThe lander and rover were originally built as back-ups for 2013's Chang'e-3 mission. However, they have received important modifications for the ambitious touchdown on the far side.\n\nChang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations.\n\nScientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea.\n\nThe lander will also carry a 3kg (6.6lb) container with potato and arabidopsis plant seeds - as well as silkworm eggs - to perform biological studies. The \"lunar mini biosphere\" experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities.\n\nThe rover will carry a panoramic camera; a radar to probe beneath the lunar surface; an imaging spectrometer to identify minerals; and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface.\n\nIn an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: \"Chang'e-4 will be humanity's first landed exploration of the lunar far side. The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link.\"\n\nThus, the landers must communicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao, launched by China in May this year.\n\nQueqiao orbits 65,000km (40,000mi) beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina.\n\nThe lander and rover was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China on 7 December; the vehicles arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December.\n\nThe mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Recycling: Where is the plastic waste mountain?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46566795", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A woman collecting plastic at a waste dump in Indonesia - in the year to October, the country received 63,000 tonnes of UK plastic\n\nA year ago, experts warned that the UK could face a mountain of waste plastic as China imposed a ban on waste imports.\n\nIn recent years, the UK has heavily relied on China to take our unwanted plastic packaging. Three years ago, the UK was exporting half a million tonnes of plastic to China and Hong Kong - accounting for almost two-thirds of all our plastic sent abroad.\n\nChina introduced its ban on \"foreign garbage\" as part of a move to upgrade its industries 12 months ago. At the time, the UK recycling industry warned that the decision would be a \"game-changer\" and that it would be a struggle to deal with the country's waste.\n\nWhere is that plastic mountain?\n\nWell, it hasn't appeared - partly thanks to other countries taking our waste plastic instead, and partly because we are burning more of it.\n\nIn the wake of mass public alarm about plastic pollution we may also be producing less plastic waste, although it's impossible to be sure of the figures\n\nWho has taken our waste instead of China?\n\nIn the 12 months to October 2018, our analysis of Environment Agency figures shows that the UK exported a total of 611,000 tonnes of recovered plastic packaging to other countries.\n\nIn the previous 12-month period (ie to October 2017), the UK exported 683,000 tonnes.\n\nSo that works out as a drop in exports of 72,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-2018.\n\nIt's clear that other countries have imported much of the plastic packaging previously reprocessed by China.\n\nBut incineration in the UK has also increased, and we may be seeing the benefits of the Blue Planet effect on public behaviour.\n\nThe fact is we can't be certain from the data what exactly has happened to the shortfall.\n\nWhere did our plastic packaging go in 2018?\n\nWell, where there's waste plastic there's potentially profit - because some of it can be lucratively recycled. So some nations have geared up their reprocessing plants to welcome our waste with open arms.\n\nMany Chinese recyclers moved their operations abroad to benefit from cheap flows of plastic in the region before then re-exporting it back to China as recycled pellets.\n\nBut not all of it has been welcomed. Several countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan have heavily restricted imports because shipments were blocking ports and the quality of the material being imported (from all countries) was poor.\n\nSo while the amount of plastic taken by China dropped by 94% between 2016-17 and 2017-18, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland and Indonesia led the pack in gobbling up the slack.\n\nMalaysia imported 105,000 tonnes in total and was way out in front. That total was 42,000 (68%) more in 2017-18 compared with the previous year.\n\nThe second most popular destination was Turkey (80,000 tonnes).\n\nPoland is in third place on the league table - although it actually received slightly less UK plastic in 2017-18 than it did in 2016-17. It's not clear why.\n\nIn fourth place is Indonesia, which along with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam - is in the top 10 for the quantity of waste plastics polluting the ocean.\n\nWhich countries recorded the biggest increase in UK plastic over the period?\n\nAnother way of analysing the data is to rank the numbers in terms of net increase (ie which countries recorded the biggest increase in 2017-18 compared with 2016-17).\n\nOn this measure, Malaysia and Turkey remain at the top while Indonesia stays in the top five.\n\nThe new entries (replacing Poland and the Netherlands) are Spain and France. Spain recorded an increase of 14,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-18, and France was just behind on 9,000.\n\nOf course, sending material abroad for recycling doesn't necessarily mean it actually gets recycled.\n\nWaste firms in the receiving country may sift through the rubbish, take out the economically valuable material and burn or even dump the rest. The waste industry is notorious in some places for its links with criminal activity.\n\nThe global illegal waste trade is estimated by the UN to be worth between \u00a38bn-\u00a39.5bn a year.\n\nCase study: Malaysia\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Campaigners say illegal waste dumps in Malaysia have become a problem since China's plastic import ban\n\nSince China's ban, Malaysia has seen a big surge in the amount of plastic it has received from abroad, including from the UK.\n\n\"Malaysia is not able to process all of the imported waste, there are limited plastic waste factories\", says Mageswari Sangaralingam who works for the Consumers' Association of Penang and for Friends of the Earth, Malaysia.\n\nAccording to Ms Sangaralingam, not only is Malaysia receiving more plastic than it can properly dispose of, some of it is low-grade which ends up as landfill. There are also some rogue recyclers who, she says, burn plastic in the open - leading to environmental harm.\n\nThe Malaysian government has announced stricter conditions on the import of plastic and says it wants to phase it out over the next three years - but Ms Sangaralingam wants an immediate outright ban.\n\n\"Malaysia is not a dumping ground and hence should stop importing plastic waste,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Could Malaysia follow China's lead and ban plastic imports outright?\n\nWhat's the UK doing about the issue?\n\nThe British Plastics Federation (BPF) told us it was \"very worried\" about the export of poor quality plastic waste. The chairman of its recycling group, Roger Baynham, told us all that UK companies should make the very best efforts to ensure plastic goes to reputable recyclers:\n\n\"The export of plastic waste is out of the control of the industry and the BPF is particularly concerned about recent reports of illegal and fraudulent exports of plastic packaging waste routed to Asia through Holland.\"\n\nThe BPF also told us it would support a global accreditation system for the waste export sector and that recycling should be done at home.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove says the UK must stop \"off-shoring its dirt\". We asked the UK government why it didn't simply ban the export of waste plastic.\n\nWe were told that while the UK was committed to \"recycling more at home\" there is a \"legitimate export market for plastics particularly for countries that manufacture new products out of recycled plastic waste\".\n\nMr Gove wants to stimulate more recycling, but UK firms wanting to process more waste in Britain complain it's hard to get funding.\n\n\"There are very few countries left where we can comfortably export to and the market is shrinking,\" warns Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association.\n\n\"People don't want to buy this material, so where on earth is this all going to go?\" he adds.\n\nMr Ellin is largely supportive of the government's new waste strategy plan, but says the UK must expand its processing capacity at a faster pace:\n\n\"We're almost at a crisis point, unless we get a plan quickly,\" he says.\n\nLess than half of all household waste is recycled\n\nOverall recycling figures have stagnated and some councils are burning 80% of all residual waste, including recyclable plastic and paper.\n\nIn the 12 months to March, 50 of 123 councils incinerated more than half the household rubbish they collected, including plastic and paper, official figures recently revealed. The worst are in London. Westminster burned 82% of all household and recyclable rubbish.\n\nLess than half of all household waste (45.2%) was recycled in 2017 - a minuscule rise of just 0.3% on the previous year. The UK now seems unlikely to reach the EU-enforced target of 50% recycling in the next two years.\n\nThe Western Riverside Waste Authority, which covers Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Wandsworth, incinerated 79% as did Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. Slough, Kirklees, Sunderland, Portsmouth and Birmingham councils all incinerated at least 70% of all plastic, paper and household rubbish.\n\nSwindon Borough Council said in November it wants to burn plastic along with other rubbish rather than sending it abroad for recycling - saying some \"isn't properly recycled\".\n\nAnalysis by the BBC suggests that recycling rates are being hindered by the myriad of different rules which are in play up and down the country.

And where did they come from?\n\nIn the last few years, the debate over these questions has become more and more heated.\n\nHindu right-wingers believe the source of Indian civilisation are people who called themselves Aryans - a nomadic tribe of horse-riding, cattle-rearing warriors and herders who composed Hinduism's oldest religious texts, the Vedas.\n\nThe Aryans, they argue, originated from India and then spread across large parts of Asia and Europe, helping set up the family of Indo-European languages that Europeans and Indians still speak today.\n\nAs it happens, many 19th Century European ethnographers and, of course, most famously, Adolf Hitler, also considered Aryans the master race who had conquered Europe, although the German leader considered them to be of Nordic lineage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Harappan civilisation thrived in north-western India and Pakistan\n\nWhen scholars use the term Aryan, it refers to a group of people who spoke Indo-European languages and called themselves Aryans. And that is how I have used it in this article. It does not refer to a race, as Hitler used it or as some in the Hindu right wing use it.\n\nMany Indian scholars have questioned the \"out of India\" thesis, arguing that these Indo-European language speakers - or Aryans - were possibly just one of many streams of prehistoric migrants who arrived in India after the decline of an earlier civilisation. This was the Harappan (or Indus Valley) civilisation, which thrived in what is now north-western India and Pakistan around the same time as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.\n\nHowever, Hindu right-wingers believe the Harappan civilisation was also an Aryan or Vedic civilisation.\n\nTensions between the two groups backing these opposing theories have only increased in the last few years, especially since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in India in 2014.\n\nInto this long-running dispute has now stepped the relatively new discipline of population genetics, which has started using ancient DNA to figure out when people moved where.\n\nStudies using ancient DNA have been rewriting prehistory all over the world in the last few years and in India, there has been one fascinating discovery after another.\n\nThe most recent study on this subject, led by geneticist David Reich of Harvard University, was published in March 2018 and co-authored by 92 scholars from all over the world - many of them leading names in disciplines as diverse as genetics, history, archaeology and anthropology.\n\nUnderneath its staid title - The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia - lay some volcanic arguments.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dholavira in Gujarat state is one of the five largest Harappan sites\n\nThe study showed that there were two major migrations into India in the last 10,000 years.\n\nThe first one originated from the Zagros region in south-western Iran (which has the world's first evidence for goat domestication) and brought agriculturists, most likely herders, to India.\n\nThis would have been between 7,000 and 3,000BCE. These Zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent - the First Indians, descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who had reached India around 65,000 years ago - and together, they went on to create the Harappan civilisation.\n\nIn the centuries after 2000 BCE came the second set of immigrants (the Aryans) from the Eurasian Steppe, probably from the region now known as Kazakhstan. They likely brought with them an early version of Sanskrit, mastery over horses and a range of new cultural practices such as sacrificial rituals, all of which formed the basis of early Hindu/Vedic culture. (A thousand years before, people from the Steppe had also moved into Europe, replacing and mixing with agriculturists there, spawning new cultures and spreading Indo-European languages).\n\nOther genetic studies have brought to light more migrations into India, such as that of the speakers of Austro-Asiatic languages who came from south-eastern Asia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption India's population is made up of a number of layers, according to the research\n\nAs I write in my book, the best way to understand the Indian population is to imagine it as a pizza, with the first Indians forming its base. Though the base of this rather irregular pizza is thin in some places and thick in others, it still serves as the support that the rest of the pizza is built upon because studies show that 50% to 65% of the genetic ancestry of Indians derives from the First Indians.\n\nOn top of the base comes the sauce that is spread over the pizza - the Harappans. And then come the toppings and the cheese - the Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European language speakers or Aryans, all of whom found their way into the subcontinent later.\n\nTo many in the Hindu right wing, these findings are unpalatable. They have been campaigning to change school curricula and remove any mention of Aryan immigration from textbooks. And on Twitter, several hugely popular right-wing \"history\" handles have long been attacking India's leading historians who have defended the theory of Aryan migrations and continue to do so.\n\nFor Hindu nationalists, there is a cost to admitting that the Aryans were not the first inhabitants of India and that the Harappan civilisation existed long before their arrival. It would mean acknowledging that Aryans or their Vedic culture were not the singular fountainhead of Indian civilisation and that its earliest sources lay elsewhere.\n\nIndia's junior minister for human resource development, Satyapal Singh, was recently quoted in the media as saying: \"Only Vedic education can nurture our children well and make them patriots who have mental discipline.\"\n\nThe idea of the mixing of different population groups is also unappealing to Hindu nationalists as they put a premium on racial purity. There is also the additional issue of the migration theory putting Aryans on the same footing as latter-day Muslim conquerors of India - such as the Mughals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi - India is a predominantly Hindu nation\n\nThese are not just theoretical debates. The ruling BJP government in Haryana state, which neighbours the Indian capital Delhi, has demanded that the Harappan civilisation be renamed the Saraswati river civilisation. Since the Saraswati is an important river that is mentioned in the earliest of the four Vedic texts, such a renaming would serve to emphasise the link between the civilisation and the Aryans.\n\nThe new study puts an end to these debates and it has thus come as a shock to the Hindu right-wing. In a tweet attacking its co-author Prof Reich, ruling party MP and former Harvard University professor Subramanian Swamy said: \"There are lies, damned lies and (Harvard's 'Third' Reich and Co's) statistics.\"\n\nHowever, the real message that the new research carries is an exciting and hopeful one: that Indians have created a long-lasting civilisation from a variety of heredities and histories.\n\nThe genius of the Indian civilisation during its best periods has been inclusion, not exclusion. Unity in diversity is, indeed, the central theme of India's genetic make-up.\n\nTony Joseph is the author of Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From, published by Juggernaut"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "New Year\u2019s Resolution", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/new-year-s-resolution-1831408235", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Each year, Americans celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve by resolving to change some aspect of their lives.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Four months later, Democrat Conor Lamb embarrassed Republicans in a nationally watched special election in a Pittsburgh-area congressional district that Trump had won by 20 percentage points.\n\nThen, in November's midterm election, the GOP's Trump-hugging candidates for governor and U.S. Senate got pounded by double digits, while the party lost three more congressional seats and, for the first time in modern history, a majority of state legislative seats in Philadelphia's suburbs.\n\nNow, Republicans are picking up the pieces and, in some quarters, calculating that those performances mean nothing good for Trump's chances at carrying Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThose farther away from the biggest metropolitan areas seem untroubled by it. With 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is a huge prize in the race for the White House, and Trump carried it by driving up his support with white, working-class voters far from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\nBut many Republican Party figures in Pennsylvania's largest metro areas question whether Trump can raise another wave among rural voters and conservative Democrats, who are credited with carrying him past Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nThey are particularly wary of a supercharged anti-Trump coalition of liberal voters and moderate suburbanites that powered Democratic victories in 2017 and 2018 and inflicted losses on Republicans unlike anything seen 2016, when a similar coalition formed.\n\nAlan Novak is among them.\n\nThe former four-term state party chairman from Chester County wonders whether Trump \u201cfatigue\u201d in 2020 will diminish the huge margins elsewhere that helped Trump overcome heavy losses in Philadelphia and its suburbs in 2016.\n\n\u201cI'm sure his base is still solid,\u201d Novak said. \u201cBut is that base enough?\u201d\n\nPredicting the future with Trump is, of course, particularly fraught.\n\nThere's the constant turmoil of Trump's administration and the prospect that more bad news could emerge from the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia.\n\nPlus, who knows what kind of nominee Democrats will produce?\n\n\u201cHe's certainly got an excellent chance, especially because we have no clue who the Democrats will put up,\u201d said Richard Stewart, who co-chairs the state Republican Party's central committee caucus. \u201cIf they put up a real left-wing type, which seems like all they have anymore, I think it'll be much easier.\u201d\n\nTrump became the first Republican presidential nominee to win Pennsylvania since 1988, but didn't necessarily need to win Pennsylvania to capture the White House. Rather, Pennsylvania - the nation's fifth-most populous state - was part of a bloc of four industrial-belt \u201cblue wall\u201d states that handed victory to Trump after Democrat Barack Obama won them twice.\n\nIf anything, Democrats need Pennsylvania in a worse way: Harry Truman in 1948 was the last Democrat to lose Pennsylvania and win the White House.\n\nDemocrats viewed 2016 as a wake-up call and say they will be more prepared to fight for Pennsylvania. As soon as Trump won in 2016, the party began planning on a comeback in 2020.\n\nPennsylvania's Republican Party chairman, Val DiGiorgio of Chester County, said cities and suburbs are not irrevocably hardened against Trump. But, he suggests, the president needs to hedge his bets and bring a message to those voters.\n\nOne Trump voter, Tony Sciullo of suburban Pittsburgh, has continued to sour on Trump, sometimes disagreeing on policy and almost always disliking Trump's behavior. Sciullo, a registered Republican, calls Trump the \u201cmost un-Republican Republican ever,\u201d one whose credibility is marred by a self-serving attitude and personal attacks on others.\n\nRepublicans in Pennsylvania's exurbs and rural areas, however, question any change in strategy. Trump's base is solid and the economy is just fine, they say.\n\nIn Armstrong County, where 2016 turnout was among the state's highest and Trump beat Clinton by 3 to 1, voters are as enthused about Trump as they were two years ago, said Mike Baker, the county's GOP chairman.\n\nTrump can win again without the cities and suburbs, Baker said.\n\n\u201cHe did last time,\u201d Baker said.\n\nIn Westmoreland County, where Trump's vote margin was the second-biggest of any Pennsylvania county, GOP Chairman Kerry Jobe said the party's November's losses weren't a referendum on Trump, partly because some loyal Trump voters didn't make the effort to vote.\n\nIt'll be different when Trump is on the ballot and showcases a four-year record, Jobe said.\n\n\u201cAre you better off?

But the new majority will quickly pivot Thursday to a pair of bills to fund the parts of the government that have been shuttered in the dispute over money for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico.\n\nIt's a cold opening for the new majority, setting up an early confrontation with the Republican-led Senate and the White House and testing the House Democrats' ability to make good on their campaign pledge to focus on kitchen-table issues in the new era of divided government.\n\n\"Our first order of business will be to end the reckless Trump shutdown and reopen the government,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the incoming caucus chairman, said in an interview. Then, he said, \"we will turn our attention to bringing our democracy to life and returning our government to the people.\"\n\nSo far, House Democrats appear largely unified in their plan to vote to reopen government without the money Trump is demanding to build the border wall.\n\nJeffries said that while Trump wants to \"waste millions in taxpayer dollars on a medieval border wall,\" Democrats are drawing \"a line in the stand\" against the spending they say won't make the border any safer.\n\n\"The partisanship, rancor and dysfunction of the Trump shutdown is exactly what voters rebuked in November,\" said Rep.-elect Joe Neguse of Colorado, a new leader of the freshman class, in the Democrats' weekly address. \"And that is why on Jan. 3rd, when the new Democratic House majority arrives, we will bring the hope, vision and goals of effective governance back to the forefront.\"\n\nBut with Trump dug in over the $5 billion he wants to build the wall, the shutdown could drag on. Senate Republicans are reluctant to consider the House bills unless they know the president is on board.\n\nThe first signal Trump has given that he may be willing to talk about the wall impasse came Tuesday, when he tweeted, \"Let's make a deal?\" He's invited Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to a White House meeting Wednesday on border security.\n\nOther issues\n\nDemocrats are eager to move forward in the House on multiple fronts.\n\nThey're set to approve a rules package on Thursday that sets a new tone for governing. For example, it requires that legislation first be considered in committees before bills are brought to the floor for votes. It bans lawmakers from serving on corporate boards. And it recognizes the diversity of the new freshman class by easing a century-old rule against wearing hats on the chamber floor to allow Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, a Muslim-American from Minnesota, to wear a head scarf.\n\nBy early next week, House Democrats are expected to consider a resolution to defend the Affordable Care Act in legal proceedings after a Texas judge ruled it largely unconstitutional in a legal challenge brought by Republican attorneys general from several states.\n\nH.R. 1, the first bill of the new House majority, is a good-government package that tackles campaign finance reforms and other issues. It will begin making its way through the newly bolstered committee process.\n\nAnd they will continue their oversight of the Trump administration and Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIncoming Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., insists the new majority can \"walk and chew gum\" at the same time.\n\nStill, corralling a large House majority has never been easy, and Democrats are ushering in the largest class since the Watergate era. Republicans under retiring Speaker Paul Ryan all but gave up trying to muscle the conservative House Freedom Caucus in line. It was the Freedom Caucus leaders who urged Trump to fight for the border wall money and reject legislation that would have prevented the shutdown days before Christmas.\n\nPelosi is expected to regain the gavel Thursday, securing the votes to become speaker even after some new and returning lawmakers signaled they wanted new leadership. She would be the first woman to hold, then return, to the office.\n\nDivisions\n\nBut divisions remain, rearing up even before the newly elected members are sworn into office, as many are eager for change and ready to confront Trump.\n\nRep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has been critical of the leader's plans to create a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. She prefers a panel that focuses on renewable energy investments and whose members refuse campaign donations from oil and other fossil fuel industries.\n\n\"Our ultimate end goal isn't a Select Committee,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted as the panel was being formed. \"Our goal is to treat Climate Change like the serious, existential threat it is by drafting an ambitious solution on the scale necessary - aka a Green New Deal - to get it done. A weak committee misses the point & endangers people.\"\n\nTrump and Republicans have been eager to widen those divisions, especially as the shutdown stretches into its second week.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, panned the Democratic effort to reopen government without wall money.\n\nDemocrats vow to stay united as they work to reopen government, and press on with the priorities.\n\n\"As my mother used to say, 'This too shall pass,\"' Jeffries said. \"We will get past this shutdown and there will be ample opportunity for us to communicate with the American people and get things done on their behalf.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump, New Senator Romney Spar Over Trump's Presidency", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-new-senator-romney-spar-over-trump-s-presidency/4725555.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, the losing 2012 Republican presidential candidate, are engaging in a verbal spat just as Romney is set to claim a Senate seat in the Congress that takes office Thursday.\n\n\n\nRomney, in a Washington Post opinion article, declared Wednesday that Trump \"has not risen to the mantle of the office\" during the first two years of his presidency.\n\n\"To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,\" Romney wrote. \"A president should unite us and inspire us to follow 'our better angels.'

I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.\"\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Spacecraft Opens New Year with Flyby on Solar System's Edge", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/spacecraft-opens-new-year-with-flyby-on-solar-system-s-edge-/4725245.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "NASA's New Horizons spacecraft pulled off the most distant exploration of another world Tuesday, skimming past a tiny, icy object 4 billion miles from Earth that looks to be shaped like a bowling pin.\n\nFlight controllers in Maryland declared success 10 hours after the high-risk, middle-of-the-night encounter at the mysterious body known as Ultima Thule on the frozen fringes of our solar system, an astounding 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto.\n\n\u201cI don't know about all of you, but I'm really liking this 2019 thing so far,'' lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said to applause. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that last night, overnight, the United States spacecraft New Horizons conducted the farthest exploration in the history of humankind, and did so spectacularly.''\n\n3 years past Pluto\n\nThe close approach came a half-hour into the new year, and 3 years after New Horizons' unprecedented swing past Pluto.\n\nFor Ultima Thule \u2014 which wasn't even known when New Horizons departed Earth in 2006 \u2014 the endeavor was more difficult. The spacecraft zoomed within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of it, more than three times closer than the Pluto flyby.\n\nOperating on autopilot, New Horizons was out of radio contact with controllers at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory from late Monday afternoon until late Tuesday morning. Scientists wanted the spacecraft staring down Ultima Thule and collecting data, not turning toward Earth to phone home.\n\nMission operations manager Alice Bowman said she was more nervous this time than she was with Pluto in 2015 because of the challenges and distance, so vast that messages take more than six hours, one way, to cross the 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers). When a solid radio link finally was acquired and team members reported that their spacecraft systems were green, or good, she declared with relief: \u201cWe have a healthy spacecraft.'' Later, she added to more applause: \u201cWe did it again.''\n\nFlyby earns standing ovation\n\nCheers erupted in the control center and in a nearby auditorium, where hundreds more \u2014 still weary from the double countdowns on New Year's Eve \u2014 gathered to await word. Scientists and other team members embraced and shared high-fives, while the spillover auditorium crowd gave a standing ovation.\n\nStern, Bowman and other key players soon joined their friends in the auditorium, where the celebration continued and a news conference took place. The speakers took delight in showing off the latest picture of Ultima Thule , taken just several hundred-thousand miles (1 million kilometers) before the 12:33 a.m. close approach.\n\n\u201cUltima Thule is finally revealing its secrets to us,'' said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins.\n\nBased on the early, rudimentary images, Ultima Thule is highly elongated \u2014 about 20 miles by 10 miles (32 kilometers by 16 kilometers). It's also spinning end over end, although scientists don't yet know how fast.\n\nAs for its shape, scientists say there are two possibilities.\n\nUltima Thule is either one object with two connected lobes, sort of like a spinning bowling pin or peanut still in the shell, or two objects orbiting surprisingly close to one another. A single body is more likely, they noted. An answer should be forthcoming Wednesday, once better, closer pictures arrive.\n\nBy week's end, \u201cUltima Thule is going to be a completely different world, compared to what we're seeing now,'' Weaver noted.\n\nColor close-ups in February\n\nStill, the best color close-ups won't be available until February. Those images should reveal whether Ultima Thule has any rings or moons, or craters on its dark, reddish surface. Altogether, it will take nearly two years for all of New Horizons' data to reach Earth.\n\nThe observations should help scientists ascertain how deep-freeze objects like Ultima Thule formed, along with the rest of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nAs a preserved relic from that original time, Ultima Thule also promises to shed light on the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, in which hundreds of thousands of objects reside well beyond Neptune.\n\n\u201cThis mission's always been about delayed gratification,'' Stern reminded reporters. He noted it took 12 years to sell the project, five years to build it and nine years to reach the first target, Pluto.\n\nIts mission now totaling $800 million, the baby grand piano-sized New Horizons will keep hurtling toward the edge of the solar system, observing Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs, from afar, and taking cosmic particle measurements. Although NASA's Voyagers crossed the Kuiper Belt on their way to true interstellar space, their 1970s-era instruments were not nearly as sophisticated as those on New Horizons, Weaver noted, and the twin spacecraft did not pass near any objects known at the time.\n\nNext flyby 2020\n\nThe New Horizons team is already pushing for another flyby in the 2020s, while the nuclear power and other spacecraft systems are still good.\n\nBowman takes comfort and pleasure in knowing that long after New Horizons stops working, it \u201cwill keep going on and on.''\n\n\u201cThere's a bit of all of us on that spacecraft,'' she said, \u201cand it will continue after we're long gone here on Earth.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Helps Sniff Out Suspected Secret Nuclear Weapons Programs", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4724815.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Scientists with the complicated task of tracking secret nuclear weapons developments around the world are getting some help from a new and more-advanced artificial intelligence system.

It seems like everyone has an opinion, and new fads emerge every year.\n\nTwo major studies last year provided more fuel for a particularly polarizing topic \u2014 the role carbs play in making us fat. The studies gave scientists some clues, but, like other nutrition studies, they can't say which diet \u2014 if any \u2014 is best for everyone.\n\nThat's not going to satisfy people who want black-and-white answers, but nutrition research is extremely difficult and even the most respected studies come with big caveats. People are so different that it's all but impossible to conduct studies that show what really works over long periods of time.\n\nBefore embarking on a weight loss plan for the new year, here's a look at some of what was learned last year.\n\nFewer carbs, fewer pounds?\n\nIt's no longer called the Atkins Diet, but the low-carb school of dieting has been enjoying a comeback. The idea is that the refined carbohydrates in foods like white bread are quickly converted into sugar in our bodies, leading to energy swings and hunger.\n\nBy cutting carbs, the claim is that weight loss will be easier because your body will instead burn fat for fuel while feeling less hungry. A recent study seems to offer more support for low-carb proponents. But, like many studies, it tried to understand just one sliver of how the body works.\n\nThe study, co-led by an author of books promoting low-carb diets, looked at whether varying carb levels might affect how the body uses energy. Among 164 participants, it found those on low-carb diets burned more total calories than those on high-carb diets.\n\nThe study did not say people lost more weight on a low-carb diet \u2014 and didn't try to measure that. Meals and snacks were tightly controlled and continually adjusted so everyone's weights stayed stable.\n\nDavid Ludwig, a lead author of the paper and researcher at Boston Children's Hospital, said it suggests limiting carbs could make it easier for people to keep weight off once they've lost it. He said the approach might work best for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes.\n\nLudwig noted the study wasn't intended to test long-term health effects or real-world scenarios where people make their own food. The findings also need to be replicated to be validated, he said.\n\nCaroline Apovian of Boston University's School of Medicine said the findings are interesting fodder for the scientific community, but that they shouldn't be taken as advice for the average person looking to lose weight.\n\nDo I avoid fat to be skinny?\n\nFor years people were advised to curb fats, which are found in foods including meat, nuts, eggs, butter and oil. Cutting fat was seen as a way to control weight, since a gram of fat has twice as many calories than the same amount of carbs or protein.\n\nMany say the advice had the opposite effect by inadvertently giving us license to gobble up fat-free cookies, cakes and other foods that were instead full of the refined carbs and sugars now blamed for our wider waistlines.\n\nNutrition experts gradually moved away from blanket recommendations to limit fats for weight loss. Fats are necessary for absorbing important nutrients and can help us feel full. That doesn't mean you have to subsist on steak drizzled in butter to be healthy.\n\nBruce Y. Lee, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins, said the lessons learned from the anti-fat fad should be applied to the anti-carb fad: Don't oversimplify advice.\n\n\"There's a constant look for an easy way out,\" Lee said.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nAnother big study this past year found low-carb diets and low-fat diets were about equally as effective for weight loss. Results varied by individual, but after a year, people in both groups shed an average of 12 to 13 pounds.\n\nThe author noted the findings don't contradict Ludwig's low-carb study. Instead, they suggest there may be some flexibility in the ways we can lose weight. Participants in both groups were encouraged to focus on minimally processed foods like produce and meat prepared at home. Everyone was advised to limit added sugar and refined flour.\n\n\"If you got that foundation right, for many, that would be an enormous change,\" said Christopher Gardner of Stanford University and one of the study's authors.\n\nLimiting processed foods could improve most diets by cutting down overall calories, while still leaving wiggle room for people's preferences. That's important, because for a diet to be effective, a person has to be able to stick to it. A breakfast of fruit and oatmeal may be filling for one person, but leave another hungry soon after.\n\nGardner notes the study had its limitations, too. Participants' diets weren't controlled. People were instead instructed on how to achieve eating a low-carb or low-fat in regular meetings with dietitians, which may have provided a support network most dieters don't have.\n\nWhat works?\n\nIn the short term you can probably lose weight by eating only raw foods, or going vegan, or cutting out gluten, or following another diet plan that catches your eye. But what will work for you over the long term is a different question.\n\nZhaoping Li, director of clinical nutrition division at the University of California, Los Angeles, says there is no single set of guidelines that help everyone lose weight and keep it off. It's why diets often fail \u2014 they don't account for the many factors that drive us to eat what we do.\n\nTo help people lose weight, Li examines her patients' eating and physical activity routines to identify improvements people will be able to live with.\n\n\"What sticks is what matters,\" Li said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Extreme Weather Becoming the New Normal", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/extreme-weather-becoming-the-new-normal/4723931.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Extreme weather events are on the rise and climate change is playing a role in both the frequency and intensity of the bad weather the world is seeing.

Also on display will be refinements to autonomous transportation and gadgets taking advantage of 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks.\n\nBut the celebration of innovation will be mixed with concerns about public trust in new technology and other factors that could cool the growth of a sizzling economic sector.\n\n\"I think 2019 will be a year of trust-related challenges for the tech industry,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.\n\nCES features 4,500 exhibitors across 2.75 million square feet (250,000 square meters) of exhibit space showcasing artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, smart homes, smart cities, sports gadgets and other cutting-edge devices.

predict what someone is seeking \u2014 whether it's music or medical care.\n\nBut because this ecosystem is built around data, confidence has been eroded by scandals involving Facebook, Google and

players, the United States and China.\n\nTariffs on tech products jumped to $1.3 billion in October, according to CTA, raising fears about growth.\n\n\"It's almost inevitable that an economic slowdown will occur if these tariffs continue,\" said Sage Chandler, CTA vice president for international trade.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade issues and the arrest of a top executive of Chinese giant Huawei in

showing an \"autonomous work vehicle\" which can be configured for search and rescue operations, firefighting and other uses.\n\nOther exhibitors will be showing technology designed to serve as the \"brains\" of self-driving vehicles, not only for navigation but to create a better, more personalized \"user experience\" for travelers.\n\nThe show includes startups offering \"predictive\" health care solutions designed to anticipate the kind of care senior citizens may need.\n\nFacial recognition, which is already being used on many smartphones, will be incorporated into vehicles, doorbells and security systems as part of efforts to increase personalization and improve security.\n\nAnd consumer products group Procter & Gamble, making its first appearance at CES, will demonstrate ways to use facial recognition and AI for improved skin care and beauty recommendations.\n\nThe new applications raise questions on whether consumers are ready for technologies that evoke the notion of Big Brother and a surveillance state.\n\nBrenda Leong, senior counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington think-tank, said consumers should be mindful about whether data from facial recognition is kept only on the devices, such as in the iPhone, or held in a database.\n\n\"Even if commercial institutions are collecting the data, everybody is worried about government access,\" she said.\n\nPatrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said consumers have shown a willingness to adopt these new technologies if they offer convenience.\n\n\"If they are balanced from a benefit point of view, those worries are going to go away,\" he said.\n\nMoorhead noted that as facial recognition has become a standard feature for many smartphones, \"those fears have faded.\"\n\nO'Donnell said consumers are starting to understand more about data and become more discerning about which companies and devices they trust.\n\n\"Personalization is something people want, and they are willing to give up some privacy to get it,\" he said.\n\n\"But if they can get personalization on the device without sending it to the cloud, they get the benefits without giving up privacy.\""}, {"site":

way behind schedule on its goal of having 20,000 people on site by 2020.\n\n\"It has taken too long and I think people have moved on,\" said tech entrepreneur Josiah Mugambi, founder of Alba.one, a Nairobi-based software company, who was initially excited by the government's ambitious project.\n\nDubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a smart city \u2014 using tech to manage water and electricity efficiently and reduce commuting time \u2014 and a solution to the rapid, unplanned urbanization which has plagued existing cities.\n\nAbout 40 percent of Africa's 1 billion people live in towns and cities and the World Bank predicts the urban population will double over the next 25 years, adding pressure to already stretched infrastructure.\n\nKonza's dream is to become a top business process outsourcing hub by 2030, with on-site universities training locals to feed into a 200,000-strong tech-savvy workforce providing IT support and call center services remotely.\n\nBut the first building has yet to be completed on the 5,000-acre former cattle ranch, three years after breaking ground, and business has shifted its focus to other African countries, like Rwanda, with competing visions to become modern tech hubs.\n\n\"Nobody can wait that long for a city to be built. For a tech entrepreneur, they think about where their startup will be two to three years down the line,\" said Mugambi.\n\nOther smart cities planned across Africa include Nigeria's Eko Atlantic City near Lagos that will house 250,000 people on land reclaimed from the sea, Ghana's Hope City and an Ethiopian city styled as the real Wakanda after the film \"Black Panther.\"\n\nUtopian\n\nBringing such utopian schemes to life is no easy task for African governments that are struggling to provide adequate roads, power, water and security to their existing cities.\n\n\"Upgrading infrastructure in places like Kibera (slum) in Nairobi to provide water and a better sewerage system is equally as important as building a new city such as Konza,\" said Abdu Muwonge, a senior urban specialist with the World Bank in Kenya.\n\nSome critics say Konza was ill-conceived from the start.\n\n\"The vision is wrong; the vision is too big,\" said Aly-Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based independent financial analyst.\n\n\"This is miles from anywhere. There are not leveraging the existing infrastructure ... It is assuming that you can bring in academia, you can bring in venture capital, you can bring in corporates.\"\n\nThe first serious hurdle arose in 2012 when the National Land Commission (NLC), which manages public land, introduced a cumbersome land acquisition procedure, said Bitange Ndemo, who led a team that conceived Konza Technopolis in 2008.\n\n\"The NLC was saying we should follow the processes of acquiring public land, which would take years to complete,\" Ndemo, now an associate professor of business at the University of Nairobi, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nThe delays caused at least one deal with a German university to fall through, he said, as the process was much slower than the old one where investors signed deals directly with government ministries which took care of land leases.\n\nTo resolve this, the government transferred ownership of the site to the Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KoTDA), set up in 2012 to co-ordinate development of the new city, which now allocates land to investors on 50-year renewable leases.\n\nCold Feet\n\nFinancing has also proven a major issue.\n\nIn its strategic plan, the government promised to fund 10 percent of Konza, laying the infrastructure, while the private sector would come in with the rest of the money to build universities, offices, housing and hotels.\n\nBut the government was slow to contribute its share and has yet to pass a law to create KoTDA as a legal entity which would make it easier to sign contracts with external lenders, said Lawrence Esho, one of Konza's project planners until 2013.\n\n\"They are way behind schedule partly because the government took time to give Konza money,\" he said, adding that no money came in until 2013.\n\n\"This stopped any work from starting at the site and investors may have developed cold feet as they waited.\"\n\nKoTDA's chief executive, John Tanui, said the government has committed to invest more than 80 billion shillings ($780 million).\n\n\"When I say committed does not mean we have absorbed. Our absorption is less than 10 percent of that figure,\" he said, without elaborating.\n\nThe government has stepped up funding since 2017, said Abraham Odeng, deputy secretary at Kenya's Information Communications and Technology ministry, without giving figures.\n\nOdeng pointed to a 40 billion shilling contract signed in 2017 with an Italian firm to build roads, water and sewerage infrastructure by 2021, funded by the Italian government.\n\n\"That is a concessional loan, which is a long-term loan that the Kenyan government will pay,\" he said.\n\nDrop in the Ocean\n\nBut Kenya's growing reliance on loans is causing jitters, with the International Monetary Fund warning of an increased risk of default.\n\nThe Washington-based lender forecast Kenya's total public debt will reach 63 percent of economic output or GDP for 2018, up from 53 percent in 2016, citing the government's public investment drive and revenue shortfalls.\n\nThe World Bank's Muwonge said the issue is eliminating challenges for the private sector to do business.\n\n\"Getting Konza city off the ground will require that we pull in private capital with concessions for them to deliver certain kinds of infrastructure for which the government may not have resources,\" he said.\n\nFive local investors, including Nairobi-based software developer Craft Silicon and the state-run Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, are expected to build offices, residential buildings and hotels by 2020, KoTDA head Tanui said.\n\nBut critics say it is not enough.\n\n\"What (investors) have allocated so far is still a drop in the ocean,\" said Ndemo, the former government technocrat.\n\nAnd international interest is shifting elsewhere.\n\nRwanda \u2014 widely regarded as the least corrupt country in East Africa \u2014 launched its Kigali Innovation City in 2015, designed to host 50,000 people in universities and tech companies on a 70-hectare site outside the capital.\n\nThe $2 billion plan, due for completion by 2020, is seven times cheaper than Konza.\n\n\"All these other (cities) have better proximity, have better density and have better collaborative feedback loops,\" said financial analyst Satchu. \"We are now at a serious disadvantage vis-a-vis these other countries.\"\n\n($1 = 102.5000 Kenyan shillings)"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Indian Nuns Say Priests Sexually Abused Them For Years: 'We Need To Stand Up For The Truth'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ap-exclusive-india-s-hidden-years-of-nuns-abused-by-priests_us_5c2cfc38e4b08aaf7a953327", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "KURAVILANGAD, India (AP) \u2014 The stories spill out in the sitting rooms of Catholic convents, where portraits of Jesus keep watch and fans spin quietly overhead. They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens. Always, the stories come haltingly, quietly. Sometimes, the nuns speak at little more than a whisper.\n\nAcross India, the nuns talk of priests who pushed into their bedrooms and of priests who pressured them to turn close friendships into sex. They talk about being groped and kissed, of hands pressed against them by men they were raised to believe were representatives of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cHe was drunk,\u201d said one nun, beginning her story. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to say no,\u201d said another.\n\nAt its most grim, the nuns speak of repeated rapes, and of a Catholic hierarchy that did little to protect them.\n\nThe Vatican has long been aware of nuns sexually abused by priests and bishops in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa, but it has done very little to stop it, The Associated Press reported last year.\n\nNow, the AP has investigated the situation in a single country \u2014 India \u2014 and uncovered a decades-long history of nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people \u2014 nuns, former nuns and priests, and others \u2014 said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.\n\nStill, the scale of the problem in India remains unclear, cloaked by a powerful culture of silence. Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest\u2019s sexual advances. Some believe it is rare. Almost none, though, talk about it readily, and most speak only on the condition they not be identified.\n\nBut this summer, one Indian nun forced the issue into the open.\n\nWhen repeated complaints to church officials brought no response, the 44-year-old nun filed a police complaint against the bishop who oversees her religious order, accusing him of raping her 13 times over two years. Soon after, a group of her fellow nuns launched a two-week public protest in India\u2019s Catholic heartland, demanding the bishop\u2019s arrest.\n\nIt was an unprecedented action, dividing India\u2019s Catholic community. Inside the accuser\u2019s convent in rural Kerala state, she and the nuns who support her are now pariahs, isolated from the other sisters, many of whom insist the bishop is innocent. The protesting nuns get hate mail and avoid going out.\n\n\u201cSome people are accusing us of working against the church, of being against the church. They say, \u2018You are worshipping Satan,\u2019\u201d said one supporter, Sister Josephine Villoonnickal. \u201cBut we need to stand up for the truth.\u201d\n\nVilloonnickal has been a nun for 23 years, joining when she was a teenager. She scoffs at the idea that she wants to harm the church.\n\n\u201cWe want to die as sisters,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nSome nuns\u2019 accounts date back decades \u2014 like that of the sister, barely out of her teens, who was teaching in a Catholic school in the early 1990s.\n\nIt was exhausting work, and she was looking forward to the chance to reflect on what had led her \u2014 happily \u2014 to convent life.\n\n\u201cWe have kind of a retreat before we renew our vows,\u201d she said, sitting in the painfully neat sitting room of her big-city convent, where doilies cover most every surface, chairs are lined up in rows and the blare of horns drifts in through open windows. \u201cWe take one week off and we go for prayers and silence.\u201d\n\nShe had traveled to a New Delhi retreat center, a collection of concrete buildings where she gathered with other young nuns. A priest was there to lead the sisters in reflection.\n\nThe nun, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on condition she not be identified, is a strong and forceful woman who has spent years working with India\u2019s poor and dispossessed, from battered wives to evicted families.\n\nBut when she talks about the retreat her voice grows quiet, as if she\u2019s afraid to be overheard in the empty room: \u201cI felt this person, maybe he had some thoughts, some attraction.\u201d\n\nHe was in his 60s. She was four decades younger.\n\nOne night, the priest went to a neighborhood party. He came back late, after 9:30 p.m., and knocked at her room.\n\n\u2033\u2018I need to meet you,\u2019\u201d he said when she cracked open the door, insisting he wanted to discuss her spiritual life. She could smell the alcohol.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not stable. I\u2019m not ready to meet you,\u201d she told him.\n\nBut the priest forced open the door. He tried to kiss her. He grabbed at her body, groping wherever he could.\n\nWeeping, she pushed him back enough to slam the door and lock it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t rape. She knows it could have been so much worse. But decades later she still reels at the memory, and this tough woman, for a few moments, looks like a scared young girl: \u201cIt was such a terrifying experience.\u201d\n\nAfterward she quietly told her mother superior, who allowed her to avoid other meetings with the priest. She also wrote an anonymous letter to church officials, which she thinks may have led to the priest being re-assigned.\n\nBut nothing was said aloud. There were no public reprimands, no warnings to the many nuns the priest would work with through his long career.\n\nShe was too afraid to challenge him openly.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine taking that stand. It was too scary,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was risking my own vocation.\u201d\n\nSo the fierce nun remained silent.\n\n___\n\nCatholic history is filled with women who became martyrs to their own purity: Saint Agatha had her breasts torn off for refusing to marry; Saint Lucy was burned alive and stabbed in the throat for defending her virginity; Saint Maria Goretti was 11 years old when she was killed by a man who tried to rape her.\n\n\u201cIt is a sin!\u201d Maria is said to have cried out. \u201cGod does not want it!\u201d\n\nBut for a nun, fighting off a priest\u2019s advances means pinballing through centuries-old sexual and clerical traditions. Celibacy is a cornerstone of Catholic religious life, as is sexual purity among nuns. Many nuns say a sister who admits to a sexual experience \u2014 even if it\u2019s forced \u2014 faces the risk of isolation within her order, and possibly even expulsion.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll be kept in your congregation, because so much is about your vow of chastity,\u201d said Sister Shalini Mulackal, a New Delhi-based theologian. \u201cThat fear is there for the young ones to disclose what has happened to them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, priests are seen as living representatives of Christ, with obedience to them another Catholic cornerstone.\n\nThen there is the isolation of young women struggling to find their way in new communities after leaving their homes.\n\nCaught at this intersection of sexual taboo, Catholic hierarchy and loneliness, sisters can be left at the mercy of predatory priests.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion bottled up and when a little tenderness is shown by somebody it can be so easy for you to cross boundaries,\u201d said Sister Dorothy Fernandes, who has spent years working with the urban poor in eastern India. \u201cIt can be hard to tell what is love and what is exploitation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard for sisters from Kerala, a deeply conservative region long the birthplace of most Indian nuns. Sex is rarely mentioned openly in small-town Kerala, boys and girls are largely kept apart, and a visible bra strap can be a minor crisis for a young woman.\n\n\u201cOnce you grow up, once you get your first menstruation, you are not encouraged to speak normally to a boy. And the boys also vice-versa,\u201d said a nun from Kerala, a cheerful woman with sparkly glass earrings and an easy smile. She remembers the misery of Sunday mass as an adolescent, when boys would stand outside the church to watch girls filing in, eyes crawling over their young figures. \u201cWe have a terrible taboo about sex.\u201d\n\nThat naivety, she said, can be costly.\n\nLike the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, a coastal region and former Portuguese colony.\n\nShe shook her head: \u201cI was in charge of visitors, and we had this bad habit of being hospitable.\u201d\n\nAt one point, she brought the priest\u2019s laundry to his small room, where he was sitting. As she set down the clothes, he grabbed her and began to kiss her.\n\nAt first, she had no idea what was happening.\n\n\u201cThe kissing was all coming here,\u201d she said, gesturing at her chest.\n\nThe confusion of that day is still clear on her face: \u201cI was young. He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: \u2018Is this the way that Goans kiss?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe quickly understood what was happening but couldn\u2019t escape his fierce grip. She also could not call out for help: \u201cI cannot shout! He\u2019s a priest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to offend him. I didn\u2019t want to make him feel bad,\u201d she said.\n\nSo she pushed herself away from him until she could slip out the door.\n\nShe quietly told a senior nun to not send novices to the priest\u2019s room. But, like the nun who fought the drunken priest, she made no official complaint.\n\nA complaint against a priest means leveling an accusation against someone higher in the church hierarchy. It can mean getting pulled into a tangle of malicious rumors and church politics. It means risking your reputation, and the reputation of your order.\n\nIn the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping.\n\nArchbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara, a New Delhi-based church leader, calls incidents of abuse \u201ckind of sporadic. Once here, once there.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cmany people don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey may talk in the community, but they don\u2019t want to bring it to the public, to the court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking up can also risk financial troubles, since many congregations of nuns are financially subservient to priests and bishops.\n\nThe silence is magnified in India by demographics, religious politics and a deep-seated belief that women have little value.\n\nThere are roughly 18 million Catholics in India, but that\u2019s a small minority in this largely Hindu nation of 1.3 billion. Speaking up could tarnish the image of their church, many nuns worry, and feed criticism by Hindu hardliners.\n\n\u201cEven we, as religious sisters, even we try to keep it quiet,\u201d said Mulackal, the theologian. \u201cA woman who goes through this experience, she just wants to hide it and pretend everything is OK.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe rapes, the nun says, happened in Room 20 of a small convent at the end of a one-lane road in rural Kerala.\n\nSet amid rows of banana and rubber trees near the little town of Kuravilangad, the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. In the garden, a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooks a decorative fish pond the size of a child\u2019s wading pool. The pond is covered in green scum.\n\nThe rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this tiny small world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal.\n\nSmart and ambitious, Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala to become a bishop in north India, overseeing a sprawling Catholic community. He was also the official patron of her community of 81 sisters, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments.\n\nThe nun is a friendly woman with jet black hair known for her quiet confidence. Every few months, she says, Mulakkal would visit the St. Francis convent and summon her. Then, according to a letter she wrote to church officials, he raped her.\n\nThe letter says the first rape happened on May 5, 2014. The last time was Sept. 23, 2016. The dates are recorded in the convent\u2019s visitor logs.\n\nMulakkal angrily denies the accusations, telling reporters the charges were \u201cbaseless and concocted\u201d and accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him into giving her a better job.\n\n\u201cI am going through painful agony,\u201d said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. \u201cI tell everyone to pray to God: Let the truth prevail.\u201d\n\nCatholicism envelopes this part of Kerala. Towns are marked by their cathedrals, convents and roadside shrines, where the Virgin watches passing traffic or St. George slays the dragon. Businesses proclaim their owners\u2019 faith: St. Mary\u2019s Furniture and Bed Center; Ave Maria Electronics; Jesus Oil Industries.\n\nAround here, many see Mulakkal as a martyr.\n\nA string of supporters visited him in jail, and crowds greeted him when he returned home, a ring of policemen holding back people who showered him with flower petals. \u201cHearty Welcome!\u201d a banner proclaimed.\n\nBut at the St. Francis convent, one group of nuns watched news reports about that welcome with dismay. While the sister leveling the accusations against Mulakkal does not speak publicly, a half-dozen nuns cluster around her, offering support and speaking on her behalf.\n\n\u201cNobody came to see sister, but so many people came to wait in line to meet Bishop Franco in jail,\u201d said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support the woman she calls \u201cour survivor sister.\u201d\n\nThat sister was the second of five children in a Kerala family. Her father was in the army. Her mother died when she was in high school. Wracked with grief, she was sent to stay with a cousin - a priest - living in north India. Inspired by her time with him, she became a nun in 1994, working in her early years as a teacher.\n\nShe knew Mulakkal, of course. Everyone in the Missionaries of Jesus knows him. But the two were never close, the accuser\u2019s friends say, and had no consensual sexual relationship.\n\nIt was about fear.\n\n\u201cThe bishop is such a powerful person and standing against him, where will she go?\u201d asked Villoonnickal. \u201cIf she went home what will happen to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,\u201d she continued.\n\nEventually, they say, she told some sisters what was happening. Then she says she repeatedly complained to church authorities. When nothing happened, she went to the police.\n\nShe also went to confession.\n\nThere, according to the other nuns, she was told she had to resist the bishop.\n\n\u2033\u2018Even if you have to die, don\u2019t submit yourself.\u2019\u201d the priest told her in confession, according to Villoonnickal. \u201d\u2018Be courageous.\u2019\u201d\n\nCatholic authorities have said little about the case, with India\u2019s Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference saying in an October statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and that the investigation and court case, which could take many years, must run their course.\n\n\u201cSilence should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe request prayers for the Church at this difficult time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIn Malayalam, the language of Kerala, sisters who leave the convent are sometimes marked as \u201cMadhilu Chadi\u201d \u2014 Wall Jumpers. It\u2019s a mocking term for the sexually frustrated and is often used for nuns and priests who have fled religious life.\n\nThose who stay get respect. They have communities that embrace them. Their lives have direction, purpose. Those who leave often find themselves adrift in India, searching for new identities and spurned by families and friends. The events that knit families together \u2014 weddings, funerals, reunions \u2014 are suddenly off-limits. The emotional toll can be immense.\n\nSpeaking up about the church\u2019s troubles, many nuns say, could end with them forced from their convents, cut off in many ways from what they\u2019ve always known.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fear of being isolated if I speak the truth,\u201d said the nun who fought off the drunken priest. \u201cIf you do that, you have to go against your own community, your own religious superiors.\u201d\n\nThe result is an engulfing silence. Silence is the armor that sisters use to protect themselves and the lives they have created, even if it also means struggling with their memories, and protecting the men who abused them.\n\nIn the end, most say nothing."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Protests Erupt In India After Women Defy Menstruation Ban At Hindu Temple", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protests-erupt-in-india-after-women-defy-menstruation-ban-at-hindu-temple_us_5c2cbeb8e4b0407e9086baef", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Two women defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple in the Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, sparking protests and calls for a strike by conservative Hindu groups outraged by their visit.\n\nPolice fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse a large crowd of protesters in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, television news channels showed.\n\nThere were protests in several other cities in the state, media reported.\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women or girls of menstruating age from entering the Sabarimala temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year. But the temple refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit it had been blocked by thousands of\n\ndevotees.\n\nThe Kerala state government is run by left-wing parties and it has sought to allow women into the temple \u2015 a position that has drawn the criticism of both of India\u2019s main political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu\n\nnationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe uproar has put the issue of religion, which can be highly contentious in India, squarely on the political agenda months before a general election, which is due by May.\n\nThe possibility of more confrontations was raised by a call from an umbrella group of right-wing Hindu groups in Kerala, the Sabarimala Karma Samithi, which is supported by the BJP, for a state-wide protest strike on Thursday.\n\nThe BJP called for protesters to be peaceful.\n\nEarlier, the Kerala state president of the BJP described the women\u2019s visit as \u201ca conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s state president, P.S Sreedharan Pillai, told TV channels the BJP would \u201csupport the struggles against the destruction of faith by the Communists.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet all the devotees come forward and protest this,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials from the main opposition Congress party in the state, in a rare alignment with their main rival for power at the national level, the BJP, also called for protests.\n\n\u201cThis is treachery ... The government will have to pay the price for the violation of the custom,\u201d K. Sudhakaran, vice-president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, said in a statement.\n\nConservative Hindu groups say they believe women of menstruating age would defile the temple\u2019s inner shrine. The ban was imposed on all females between the ages of 10 and 50.\n\nNews channels reported the chief priest briefly shut the temple for \u201cpurification\u201d rituals after the women visited. Later, media reported it had re-opened.\n\nThe two women, identified by police as Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had tried to go in on Dec. 24, and later approached police for help, an officer said.\n\n\u201cThere was an elaborate arrangement for them to come just after the temple was opened early morning,\u201d said the officer, who declined to be identified fearing reprisals from protesters. \u201cThe darkness gave them, and us, cover.\u201d\n\nPolice were guarding the homes of the women after they left the temple and were prepared to let more women enter the temple, he said.\n\nA video from a police official posted online by ANI showed two women in the temple with their heads covered. Ammini told a television channel about their stealthy trek to the temple in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201cWe reached Pampa, the main entry point to the temple at 1.30 a.m. and sought police protection ... We walked two hours, entered the temple around 3.30 a.m. and did the darshan,\u201d the woman said, referring to a ritual of standing in front of the temple\u2019s Hindu image.\n\nThe state government defended its decision to protect the women as they went into the temple, saying it was a matter of civil rights.\n\n\u201cI had earlier made it clear that the government will provide protection if any women come forward to enter the temple,\u201d said Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.\n\nVijayan told a news conference the women faced no obstruction on Wednesday.

The Brazilian capital had moved to Bras\u00edlia, the new planned city in the country\u2019s interior, a few years prior, but Rio remained the effective center of power, and somewhere in the city, President Jo\u00e3o Goulart was clinging to power.\n\nGoulart, a leftist who became president in 1961, had spent the days prior on the phone with a top military officer, Gen. Amaury Kruel. The general was hoping to prevent the collapse of Brazil\u2019s government by urging Jango, as Goulart was known to Brazilians, to fire prominent leftist officials and institute a slate of reforms that would please both the military and the centrist establishment in Congress that opposed Goulart\u2019s shifts to the left.\n\nGoulart refused. The military marched.\n\nBy the next morning, Goulart had fled to Porto Alegre. A few days later, he was in Uruguay. Brazil\u2019s democracy had collapsed.\n\nFive decades later, on the evening of Oct. 28, 2018, members of the Brazilian military were parading through the streets of Rio again. Green Army jeeps honked their horns and flashed their lights; soldiers stood atop them as flag-waving crowds cheered their arrival.\n\nThis time, though, the military was not coming to depose a president; it was rolling through celebrations of a new one. Jair Bolsonaro, a federal congressman and former Army captain, had just won the election to become Brazil\u2019s 38th president. (The military later denied it was a parade, saying the soldiers were returning from a mission meant to guarantee the election; a video shot by a journalist depicted, let\u2019s call it, a festive procession.)\n\nMilitares brasileros desfilan por las calles de R\u00edo festejando el triunfo de Bolsonaro y la gente los vitorea. Qu\u00e9 pesadilla. pic.twitter.com/hh1gAiHA0r \u2014 Diego Iglesias (@IglesiasDiego) October 29, 2018\n\n\u201cWhat a nightmare,\u201d Argentine journalist Diego Iglesias tweeted in Spanish of the scene.\n\nBolsonaro, whose presidency will begin with a New Year\u2019s Day inaugural ceremony in Bras\u00edlia, has routinely praised Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which gave way to the return of democratic governance in 1985. And his rise to power shares many similarities with the military regime\u2019s: Bolsonaro has seized on widespread discontent and fatigue with an incapable and corrupt political establishment, on fervid opposition to a leftist party that had spent more than a decade in power, on an economic collapse that Brazil has only slowly begun to escape, and on rising levels of violent crime.\n\nAnd while he has pitched his surge to power as the result of a \u201cpopulist\u201d revolt, his base of support mirrors that of the old coup masters: wealthy financial elites, segments of the population willing to trade the rights and lives of the poor and marginalized for their own safety and economic prosperity, and traditional parties and politicians who refuse to acknowledge their own roles in creating the monster before folding themselves into his arms.\n\nAP Photo/Leo Correa In this Dec. 1, 2018 photo, Jair Bolsonaro, left, and Minister of Defense Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna attend a graduation ceremony at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Resende, Brazil.\n\nMuch like the military once did, Bolsonaro has threatened his leftist political opponents with violence and imprisonment. He has promised to deliver a political \u201ccleansing never seen before in Brazil,\u201d and threatened media outlets that report news unfavorable to him. His vice president is a former Army general who, in an interview with HuffPost Brazil, refused to rule out a return to military rule, and who has posited \u2014 over Bolsonaro\u2019s unconvincing objections \u2014 that the new administration could rewrite the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThis is not exclusively a Brazilian phenomenon. Countries around the world, from Hungary to Turkey to the Philippines, have turned to noisy leaders who promise instant renewals and silver-bullet solutions under the banner of a right-wing, nativist \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2015 the preferred term of news outlets, even though the key constituencies backing these candidates tend to comprise the nations\u2019 elite.\n\nEach major election has become, in part, a referendum on the state of global democracy as a whole. And each victory for a right-wing, anti-democratic figure has paved the way for a similar candidate in the next major election somewhere else.\n\nOf the bunch, though, Bolsonaro might be the most pressing threat to a major democracy. Brazil\u2019s is the fourth-largest in the world, and the largest by population in Latin America. If it dies, this time, it won\u2019t be at the hands of the armed forces. It will be self-inflicted.\n\n\u201cThere have been very, very few military coups in Latin America over the last 35 years,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and author of How Democracies Die. \u201cSo I think that while increased public support for a military coup is troubling, it\u2019s much more likely Brazilian democracy will die at the hands of an elected leader.\u201d\n\nBrazil is about to show the world how a modern democracy falls apart.\n\n\u2018Democracy Hasn\u2019t Delivered\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Bolsonaro supporters rally and pray in Bras\u00edlia ahead of a New Year's Day inauguration ceremony that will make him Brazil's 38th president.\n\nIt was still too early for an afternoon beer when I passed the first vendor doling out ice-cold cervejas along S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Avenida Paulista on a Brazilian summer day in late November.\n\nPaulista, which splits one of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, was closed thanks to a mid-week holiday, storefronts advertised Black Friday sales, and a giant Christmas tree outside one of the shopping malls gave away the approaching holiday season. Locals and tourists alike perused pop-up tents selling handcrafted wooden bowls and art, and loudspeakers blared a pop soundtrack for the people who\u2019d come to do yoga in the street.\n\nAside from the occasional bit of political graffiti sprayed onto a lamp post or the sidewalk, there were barely any signs that throughout 2018, Brazilians had repeatedly swarmed Avenida Paulista to demonstrate in favor of and against Bolsonaro.\n\nIt was here, in July, that people in S\u00e3o Paulo joined the largest women-led protest in Brazilian history, as women and LGBTQ people who feared Bolsonaro\u2019s history of racist, sexist and homophobic statements urged Brazilians to vote for anyone else. \u201cEle N\u0101o,\u201d they yelled \u2015 \u201cNot Him.\u201d\n\nIt was also here that Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters gathered in mid-October for a rally meant to push him over the majority threshold he had fallen just short of in the first round of voting. At that demonstration, Bolsonaro, who had been stabbed on the campaign trail in September, told the crowd via a cell phone that, as president, he would target funding for the media and human rights groups. He vowed to give his opponent \u2015 former S\u00e3o Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party \u2015 and prominent leftist activists two options: \u201cLeave, or go to jail.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of November? \u201cEverything feels normal,\u201d a friend told me, \u201cuntil you watch the news.\u201d\n\nFERNANDO SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators take part in a protest against Bolsonaro organized under the hashtag #EleNao (#NotHim), in Rio de Janeiro on Oct. 20, 2018.\n\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro is a creature of the rot in his country\u2019s democratic institutions that had set in years before he\u2019d entered the picture, or that had been there all along.\n\nPower in Brazil has always remained concentrated largely among a white and wealthy elite; literacy and education rates are still low, especially among the poor; an over-militarized and under-trained police force has continued to kill large numbers of poor (and mostly black) citizens; and the return to democracy was marked by more than a decade of economic instability and hyperinflation that perpetuated vast social, racial and income inequality.\n\nStill, Brazil has spent much of the last several decades fashioning itself into a shining example of what a democratic Latin America could one day look like. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso stabilized the economy in the early 2000s, then leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a working-class firebrand, presided over a period of rapid growth that had Brazil\u2019s economy on pace to surpass those of France and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn da Silva\u2019s watch, expanded social welfare programs helped some 30 million Brazilians rise out of poverty, and broader affirmative action policies increased educational, health and employment access for black Brazilians, women, the poor and the indigenous. Violent crime fell to its lowest levels in decades. When da Silva left office in 2010, his approval ratings neared 90 percent. Brazil, it seemed, was finally working.\n\nOr was it? In 2010, Tiririca, a Brazilian clown, announced a run for a congressional seat in S\u00e3o Paulo and launched a campaign meant to parody the Brazilian political system. \u201cPior do que est\u00e1 n\u00e3o fica, vote no Tiririca,\u201d he said: \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse, vote Tiririca.\u201d He playfully satirized the corruption endemic in Brazilian politics, promising that he would \u201cenrich every Brazilian family \u2015 especially mine.\u201d\n\nThen he won, and that victory, in retrospect, might have been a sign of a lurking discontent that Bolsonaro would soon exploit.\n\nUeslei Marcelino / Reuters Tiririca, a Brazilian comedian and member of the Lower House of Congress, is congratulated after voting in favor of the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia, on April 17, 2016.\n\nBrazil was already one of the world\u2019s most unequal countries in terms of income distribution, and while the poor unquestionably benefited from the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s policies \u2015 including a hike in the minimum wage \u2015 the vast majority of the economic gains achieved under da Silva went to the richest 1 percent of Brazil\u2019s population. So even as a new lower-middle class earned more than it ever had, Brazil\u2019s obscene levels of income inequality likely expanded during the good years. Violent crime had been reduced, but not to levels befitting a developed democracy: Even before the economic collapse, Brazil was home to more than a dozen of the planet\u2019s 50 most violent cities.\n\nThings got worse: The economy collapsed in 2013, plunging millions out of work and millions more back into poverty. In 2014, a money-laundering investigation turned into the world\u2019s broadest political corruption investigation. Known as Operation Car Wash, or \u201cLava Jato\u201d in Portuguese, it has implicated hundreds of Brazilian politicians, including da Silva and outgoing President Michel Temer, of the centrist Democratic Movement Party. Violent crime has surged \u2015 there were more than 60,000 homicides in each of the last two years. President Dilma Rousseff, da Silva\u2019s hand-picked successor, was impeached in 2016. Da Silva was convicted on money-laundering charges in 2017 and imprisoned this year; Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\n\nCompared with their counterparts across Latin America, Brazilians have always shown a low level of support for democracy. That support has eroded even further amid the crises: In 2017, just 32 percent of Brazilians agreed when Latinobar\u00f3metro, which conducts polls across the region, asked if they agreed that \u201cdemocracy may have problems but is the best system of government.\u201d No other Latin American nation showed less support for democracy, while other surveys found that nearly two-thirds of Brazilians had lost faith in political parties, the presidency and Congress. More than half of Brazilians said they would support a more authoritarian style of government if it \u201csolved problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask people on the street if they\u2019re worried about what Bolsonaro may mean for democracy, it\u2019s not like people are particularly concerned,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cDemocracy,\u201d he said, \u201chasn\u2019t delivered what many of us have expected.\u201d\n\nEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him. Marcelo Amador Pereira, S\u00e3o Paulo resident\n\nThe PT, as the Workers\u2019 Party is known by its initials in Portuguese, has received much of the blame for the backlash that fueled Bolsonaro\u2019s rise. A great deal of this criticism is legitimate: Da Silva and the Workers\u2019 Party had risen to power on something resembling revolutionary hope \u2015 a belief \u201cthat it could use the established order in Brazil to benefit the poor, without harm \u2013 indeed with help \u2013 to the rich,\u201d as the British essayist Perry Anderson wrote in 2016.\n\nBy the time Rousseff was impeached in 2016, to the delight of millions of mostly middle-class and wealthy Brazilians who had marched in the streets demanding her ouster, the party had embraced a brand of economic austerity and engaged in the sort of corruption that alienated many of its own working-class supporters.\n\nIn addition to its usual base of elites, the counter-revolution in Brazil could now count on winning at least some support from the PT\u2019s natural constituency. Bolsonaro drew support from across the political and social spectrum, even from poor and black voters whom some of his most repressive policy goals will surely target. Polls ahead of the election showed that Bolsonaro led Haddad among black and mixed-race voters and women \u2015 and that he also earned a surprisingly large share of the vote from LGBTQ Brazilians \u2015 despite his racism, sexism and homophobia.\n\n\u201cEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him,\u201d Marcelo Amador Pereira, a black man who lives in S\u00e3o Paulo and lost his job during the Rousseff administration, told HuffPost Brazil before the election. \u201cBecause he is running against the PT, and I will not accept any part in what the PT did to Brazil.\u201d\n\nElite Failure \u2015 And Acquiescence\n\nGetty Editorial Protesters hold signs saying \"Temer Out\" in Portuguese to protest the unpopular centrist leader who took power after the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Temer's links to corruption and pursuit of unpopular economic reforms sent his approval ratings into the single digits for most of his two years in office.\n\nThe problem with pitching Bolsonaro\u2019s rise to power as a purely populist revolt, though, is that the main source of his support was not the poor and working classes that had once fervently backed the Workers\u2019 Party, but the same elites Bolsonaro constantly railed against, who have taken almost no responsibility for their role in creating the circumstances that made his ascent possible.\n\nHealthy democracy relies on mutual support for a basic set of rules, but in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election, Brazil\u2019s center-right establishment began to disregard the old consensus. The center-right Social Democratic Party, or PSDB, questioned the results of Rousseff\u2019s narrow re-election that fall, giving oxygen to fringe social media conspiracy theories that the Workers\u2019 Party president had benefited from election fraud.\n\nTwo years later, the centrist parties launched an effort to impeach her that looked less like an effort to hold Rousseff accountable than a chance for Brazil\u2019s establishment to seize via goo-goo crusade the sort of power it couldn\u2019t win at the ballot box \u2014 and protect itself from judicial and public scrutiny in the process. For others on the right, including Bolsonaro, it was merely an opportunity to rid Brazil of a leftist government that they claimed had waged a war on \u201cGod, family and the Brazilian people.\u201d\n\nPaulo Whitaker/Reuters Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff with Vice President Michel Temer, left, and outgoing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, right, on Jan. 1, 2011. Since then, Rousseff has been impeached, Da Silva has been imprisoned and Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\n\nOperation Car Wash, meanwhile, has long been viewed as a positive development for Brazilian democracy, an effort to rid the country\u2019s political system of the corruption that runs rampant through it. But it\u2019s undeniable now, even for the investigation\u2019s proponents, that it played a role in undermining democracy instead of bolstering it.\n\n\u201cOne of the undesired results of the Lava Jato case \u2015 this confrontation of corruption \u2015 is a very extreme polarization of the public debate in Brazil,\u201d said Bruno Brand\u00e3o, the Brazil director of Transparency International. \u201cIt also discredited the political system and the political class. And more worrisome, it discredited the democratic system itself.\u201d\n\nThe polarization isn\u2019t entirely the result of the corruption investigation \u2015 on the left and the right, the parties of implicated politicians have spent years trying to discredit Car Wash. Temer repeatedly attempted to curtail it; Congress tried to kill new anti-corruption legislation in the middle of the night; da Silva and the PT decried it as an elite effort to destroy the left, which wasn\u2019t entirely true, given that a rash of politicians from other parties were removed from office and sent to prison, too.\n\nBut the investigators themselves helped undermine the credibility of their cause and, by extension, democracy. Judge Sergio Moro, who spearheaded the Car Wash investigation, was responsible for the conviction of da Silva, who had led presidential polls before he was banned from the race thanks to the corruption case.\n\nMoro spent years positioning himself as apolitical, but his pursuit of da Silva took on an air of zealotry. The conviction was criticized as sloppy and legally questionable by independent Brazilian legal experts, and the timing of certain revelations from Moro \u2014 wiretapped phone calls between Rousseff and da Silva, released in 2016 in the midst of her impeachment; testimony accusing da Silva, Haddad and the PT of graft, unsealed the eve of the election \u2014 suggested the judge was putting a finger on the scales of the cases and, perhaps, the election. (In November, Moro agreed to serve as the head of the National Justice Ministry under Bolsonaro.)\n\nThroughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t win, but that he couldn\u2019t. When they didn\u2019t ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow.\n\nBrazil\u2019s elites and its media, meanwhile, underestimated the strength of the anti-establishment surge taking place under their feet, or the dynamics allowing it to fester. Over and over again throughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t win, but that he couldn\u2019t. When they didn\u2019t ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow; surely his worst, most provocative statements would be enough to convince Brazilians he was too radical a reactionary.\n\nBeneath the surface, Bolsonaro and his supporters took advantage of social media, amplifying his message across Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp \u2015 Brazil\u2019s most popular social network \u2015 exploiting both the existing distrust of Brazil\u2019s largest media outlets and the utility of those social networks for spreading news that was baseless and manufactured out of thin air.\n\nMembers of the media and political elite were sure that, with da Silva and the PT seemingly discredited, a moderate, establishment figure from the center-left or center-right would emerge. But Brazilians made their fatigue with the centrist establishment clear: Whereas the Workers\u2019 Party still won more seats than any other party in congressional elections, the center-right was crushed in the first round of voting. Cynicism, corruption and the pursuit of unpopular economic policies under Temer had left a vacuum on the right, and along came Bolsonaro to fill the void.\n\nBolsonaro wielded corruption as a cudgel against the PT from the start, turning its links to Car Wash into an all-out attack on its legitimacy and right to exist. The left, Bolsonaro suggested on his website, wanted to \u201cimport ideologies that destroy our identity\u201d as Brazilians. That appealed to growing evangelical and conservative movements, as well as segments of the middle classes that opposed the left\u2019s social liberalism, and played on a backlash against efforts to advance the civil rights of the poor, LGBTQ people and black Brazilians.\n\nThat Bolsonaro had adopted an anti-corruption posture merely as a campaign tactic \u2015 much like Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d \u2015 was evident even before he took office. Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Fl\u00e1vio, is already facing questions about potential corruption, and despite pledging that his government ministries would not include anyone convicted of corruption, Bolsonaro has appointed at least seven people who have been or currently are involved in such scandals, according to The Intercept. They include his chief of staff and his finance minister, Paulo Guedes \u2015 the University of Chicago\u2013educated economist and free marketeer whose close ties to Bolsonaro during the campaign gave Brazil\u2019s business elite the assurances they needed to cozy up to the supposed \u201cpopulist.\u201d\n\nAs with Trump, Bolsonaro\u2019s attack on corruption went beyond hypocrisy. It was a Herrenvolk appeal \u2014 spoils for the dominant class, banishment or marginalization for everyone else \u2014 and the tubthumping about corruption fit into larger themes about the contamination of Brazilian identity by the country\u2019s underclasses.\n\nFor the whole of history, as Hannah Arendt wrote, totalitarians have depended on a coalition between the elite and the mob. In Brazil, as elsewhere, the rise of a new authoritarian required the acquiescence of a patrician class unwilling to accept any of the blame for the systemic ills the country was facing. And while so much media attention was lavished on the ordinary folks who supported Bolsonaro, it was more significant that his levels of support rose with each step up the income ladder, thanks to elites who shared his disdain for the left and were happy to empower a fascist to thwart it.\n\nThe worst ills Bolsonaro would inflict would be reserved for the most vulnerable of Brazil\u2019s populations, anyway. The elites, as always, are exempt from the pain they cause.\n\n\u2018Bolsonaro Can Do Things Trump Can\u2019t Do\u2019\n\nAFP Bolsonaro will take power with high levels of public support for some of his most dangerous policy proposals \u2014 including his calls to allow police officers even more leeway to shoot and kill alleged criminals.\n\nIf this all seems to bear a striking resemblance to what happened in the United States, that\u2019s no coincidence. Bolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\n\nTrump, too, was merely a symptom of a larger disease, a product of declining faith among Americans in their democratic institutions. And Bolsonaro adopted many of Trump\u2019s strategies: He, too, encouraged violence against critics, appealed to nativist and racist fears, and suggested that if he lost, it would be the result of political rivals\u2019 shenanigans. He also called for imprisoning not just his opponent, but activists who worked on the left. He targeted civil society, suggesting that nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups would be shut down. He promised to give law enforcement even more leeway to kill on sight and decried the media as agents of fake news who were simply protecting the corrupt establishment.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s campaign, like Trump\u2019s, also made a habit of tossing out increasingly absurd and anti-democratic ideas, often filtered through his son Fl\u00e1vio, a congressman who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s de facto social media guru. Fl\u00e1vio and vice presidential candidate Gen. Antonio Hamilton Mour\u00e3o would suggest increasingly radical ideas \u2015 like, say, closing Congress if necessary \u2015 only for the elder Bolsonaro to gently walk them back if a reporter asked about them or if they generated too much scrutiny.\n\nThis strategy, deliberately or not, has the effect of making Bolsonaro look more moderate than he is while shifting the very grounds on which he is being evaluated. Now, a Bolsonaro who does everything short of closing Congress, rewriting the constitution or re-establishing military rule starts to resemble a committed democrat.\n\nBolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\n\nA key difference between Bolsonaro and Trump, though, is that the worst version of the former will have much more damaging effects on Brazilian democracy than the latter has had, or could have, in the United States.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro can do things in Brazil, potentially, that Trump can\u2019t do,\u201d Levitsky said, \u201cbecause Brazilian institutions ... are nowhere near as strong as they are in the United States.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s ministerial appointments include more former military officers to serve at once in a civilian government than in any since the end of the dictatorship. He has appointed ministers who wield the same paranoid, anti-\u201cglobalist\u201d rhetoric that became commonplace in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nBolsonaro and his choice to head the education ministry, Ricardo V\u00e9lez Rodr\u00edguez, are supporters of the Escolas sem Partido (Schools Without Party) movement, a previously fringe effort to prevent public schools and universities from \u201cindoctrinating\u201d students with leftist political ideologies. There were reports in the days after the election that some universities had been raided to rid them of books on fascism, and that professors and other academics who opposed the new president and had described him as a fascist were targeted and harassed.\n\nBolsonaro, too, has sent early signals that he will follow through on his threats to seize indigenous lands to open them to mining and agricultural interests; he has said Brazil should \u201cintegrate\u201d its indigenous tribes \u2015 which include those living on protected reservations, as well as uncontacted peoples \u2015 into Brazilian society against their wishes.\n\nEven in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil will become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression.\n\nIt is possible Bolsonaro will govern as a true autocrat \u2015 that he could take advantage of any small crisis to consolidate power and sweep aside democracy in a single act. He could close Congress; he could criminalize the Workers\u2019 Party and other leftist opposition parties and movements; he could criminalize dissent, protest and the free press.\n\nMore likely is that he will govern in a manner similar to Trump, targeting the press, political opponents and democratic institutions with a constant barrage of criticism that further erodes their credibility among his supporters and the public writ large, and has a chilling effect on legitimate opposition. Bolsonaro refers to nearly everything to his political left as \u201ccommunism,\u201d and has said his movement is meant to keep \u201cforeign ideologies\u201d from making their way to Brazil. Rather than outright dictatorship, Bolsonaro\u2019s reign could come to resemble the ugliest anti-left purge in American history.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like McCarthyism,\u201d Alexandre Padilha, a high-ranking member of the Workers\u2019 Party who served in da Silva\u2019s government, told me. \u201cHe hates everything that is left in Brazil, and thinks they should be eliminated, basically.\u201d\n\nTo the right, these fears and the rhetoric that has inspired them are a source of humor. The day before the inauguration, Carlos Bolsonaro \u2015 a Rio councilman and another of the new president\u2019s sons \u2015 posted a video on Twitter of his father celebrating police killings and calling his opponents \u201cpussies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left is crying,\u201d he said, mockingly.\n\nIn the U.S., Trump\u2019s continued attacks have had negative effects on how Americans view their elections, the press and other democratic institutions, and his rhetoric has emboldened racists and white nationalists and potentially contributed to rises in violent crime against racial, ethnic and religious minorities.\n\nPolitical violence is already shockingly common in Brazil: In 2018, Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco was assassinated while leaving an event, and 28 candidates were killed during 2016 election cycle alone. Bolsonaro\u2019s insistence that his supporters take aim at Workers\u2019 Party politicians could have deadly consequences.\n\nHis people have taken their cues: In the days before the election, Bolsonaro supporters proudly destroyed memorials to Franco in Rio, and the symbols of American white nationalism \u2015 including a flag of Kekistan, the mythical country created and worshipped by alt-right fanboys in online forums \u2015 began to show up at Bolsonaro rallies. The night of the election, his supporters waved banners commemorating the former Army colonel who carried out the military dictatorship\u2019s torture program.\n\nLGBTQ Brazilians, who are already subject to high rates of violence, are also fearful that Bolsonaro\u2019s aggressive opposition to their rights will give his supporters license to level even more attacks against them. And Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric on policing and public security has only emboldened some of the hard-line officers within Brazil\u2019s police forces, according to locals.\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, a young black writer who lives in a favela on the city\u2019s outskirts told me that he had been stopped by police five times in the first three weeks after the election, usually as he was returning to the neighborhood on the way home from work. In Rio, videos circulated last month of two men lying in the street, shot to death, before the police officers who killed them threw their bodies into the back of a pickup truck. Brazil\u2019s police already killed more than 4,200 people last year \u2015 in Rio, they were responsible for 1 in every 5 homicides across the state. Bolsonaro will likely make police forces even more deadly.\n\nOn this, he will have allies both in and out of politics. Brazilians overwhelmingly support aggressive stances on policing, and amid the violent crime epidemic, more politicians have adopted hard-line stances. Wilson Witzel, the incoming governor of Rio de Janeiro, has said the state will \u201cdig graves\u201d for the bodies of alleged criminals police kill. Newly elected S\u00e3o Paulo Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria, a politician who aligned himself with Bolsonaro during the campaign, has adopted similar rhetoric when it comes to protecting police accused of killing.\n\nBrazil\u2019s institutions may shield its democracy as a whole. But even in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil will almost certainly become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression there, from the state and otherwise.\n\nA Model For \u2018Really Egregious Illiberalism\u2019\n\nThe Independent Bolsonaro modeled his rise to power on Donald Trump's. Now, right-wing politicians across Latin America will likely take lessons from Bolsonaro's victory in Brazil.\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d a woman in S\u00e3o Paulo asked me as our hotel elevator hit the ground floor.\n\nWhen I told her I lived in Washington, D.C., she smiled and turned to her child. In Portuguese, she told him that I was from the same place as Trump.\n\n\u201cEveryone here wants to go there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say all bad things about him, but everyone here wants to move there.\u201d\n\nTo many Brazilians who support Bolsonaro, the chaos Trump has sown and the threats to the tenets of American democracy he poses are nothing to worry about. The U.S. economy, after all, is doing well, and Trump is, in their view, responsible. He\u2019s an outsider who came in and shook up the system, and the establishment just hasn\u2019t learned to cope with that yet.\n\nNow, there are others looking to Bolsonaro. In Uruguay, an upstart presidential candidate is already modeling himself as his country\u2019s version of Bolsonaro; in Argentina, which faces many of the same economic and corruption issues that have plagued Brazil, similar candidates could soon emerge.\n\n\u201cThe political right has not done well in Latin America in the last few decades,\u201d Levitsky, of Harvard, said. \u201cSo right-wing politicians are looking around for a new formula, and illiberalism \u2015 really egregious illiberalism \u2015 may be that formula. If he\u2019s perceived to be successful, it will be reproduced.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro wasn\u2019t the first right-wing authoritarian to put a major democracy under threat. Neither will he be the last.\n\n\u201cWe have Bolsonaro because we have Trump,\u201d Stuenkel said. \u201cWe would not have seen the same dynamic here without what happened in the U.S. in 2016. I think that inspired a lot of people who basically learned from Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think that same way,\u201d he continued, \u201cneighboring countries in Latin America will learn from Bolsonaro.\u201d\n\nHuffPost Brazil\u2019s Diego Iraheta contributed reporting.\n\nThis piece has been updated to include the military\u2019s assertion that members of the armed forces were not \u201cparading\u201d through the streets of Rio after Bolsonaro\u2019s election."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Man Assaulted Convenience Store Employee With Banana, Police Say", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rogelio-tapia-banana-assault_us_5c2cfd66e4b0407e908766b3", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Polk County Jail Rogelio Tapia, 26, was accused of assaulting a convenience store clerk with a banana and other items.\n\nThis arrest was a little fruity.\n\nA man in Des Moines, Iowa, was jailed on Monday after police said he assaulted a convenience store clerk with a banana.\n\nRogelio Tapia, 26, got into a dispute with an unnamed person at a QuikTrip Monday morning, according to local station KCCI-TV.\n\nWhen a store clerk tried to intervene, witnesses said Tapia chased the clerk around the store, throwing a banana and other items at her, Patch Des Moines reported.

In some states, minimum wages will go up, guns will be harder to obtain, plastic straws will get the boot and hunters will get to wear pink for a change.\n\nHere are some of the noteworthy laws going into effect this year:\n\nTighter gun restrictions in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last February, thousands of protesters across the nation demanded stricter gun control measures.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school last year, California passed several measures to prevent domestic abusers and people with mental illness from obtaining guns. Californians who are involuntarily committed to a mental institution twice in a year, or who are convicted of certain domestic violence offenses, could face a lifetime gun ownership ban.\n\nUnder an expanded Oregon law that went into effect on Jan. 1, domestic abuse offenders or people under restraining orders are banned from owning or purchasing a gun. In Illinois, authorities now have the right to seize firearms from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others. A similar \u201cred flag\u201d law will go into effect in New Jersey later this year.\n\nAt least six states \u2014 California, Washington, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont \u2014 and the District of Columbia are raising the minimum age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of long guns this year, CNBC reported.\n\nWashington state will also be enforcing several other gun control measures, including enhanced background checks, secure gun storage laws and a requirement for gun purchasers to provide proof they\u2019ve undergone firearm safety training.\n\nNew \u2018Me Too\u2019 laws\n\nAP In 2018, the Me Too movement spurred many people to come forward with their stories of sexual harassment and abuse -- and prompted several states to pass new laws targeting sexual violence.\n\nSeveral states are taking aim at workplace sexual harassment. California has banned nondisclosure provisions in settlements involving claims of sexual assault, harassment or discrimination based on sex. California employers will also no longer be allowed to compel workers to sign nondisparagement agreements as a condition of employment or in exchange for a raise or bonus.\n\nBy the end of 2019, publicly held corporations in the Golden State will also need to have at least one woman on their board of directors. Depending on the size of the board, corporations will need to increase that number to at least two or three female board members by the end of 2021.\n\nIn New York, all employees will be required to complete annual sexual harassment prevention training. Larger businesses in Delaware will have to provide such training to their workers, and legislators and their staff in Virginia will need to undergo such training every year.\n\nMinimum wages get a boost\n\nThough the federal minimum wage has languished at $7.25 since 2009, at least 19 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Washington, will be raising their minimum wages this year. Each will boost its minimum wage to at least $12. Some cities like New York, Seattle and Palo Alto, California, will see their wage floors increase to $15.\n\nSo long straws and stirrers!\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Under a new California law, restaurant customers will have to explicitly ask for a plastic straw if they want to use one.\n\nAs public awareness mounts of the hazards of plastic waste pollution, cities and states around the country have been targeting a major source of the problem: single-use plastic products like straws and food containers.\n\nA new law in New York City bars restaurants, stores and manufacturers from using most foam products, including takeout containers, cups and packing peanuts.\n\nEateries in the District of Columbia are now prohibited from giving out single-use plastic straws and stirrers. In California, restaurant patrons will need to ask explicitly for a plastic straw if they want to use one. Restaurants can be fined $25 a day for serving beverages with plastic straws that aren\u2019t requested by customers.\n\nFormer felons in Florida can head to the voting booth\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In November, Florida voted to approve a ballot measure that enabled more than 1 million former felons to regain their voting rights.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Florida will restore the voting rights of all former felons except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. Some 1.4 million possible voters will be added to the rolls \u2014 an addition that could have a significant effect on elections in the swing state.\n\nUtah implements strictest DUI law in the country\n\nUtah has lowered its blood alcohol content standard for drunk driving to 0.05 percent \u2014 the lowest limit in the country.\n\nUnder the new law, a driver who exceeds that limit and causes the death of another person will be charged with criminal homicide, a felony offense.\n\nAs CNN notes, all other U.S. states have a blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.08 percent for noncommercial drivers. Since at least 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board has been pushing to lower the limit to 0.05 nationwide.\n\nPets to get more rights in California\n\nPets in California will no longer be treated by courts as physical property in divorce cases. Instead, judges can decide who gets custody of the family pet.\n\nUnder a separate California law, pet stores will no longer be allowed to sell cats, dogs or rabbits that aren\u2019t from animal shelters or nonprofit rescue groups. That law, which took effect on Jan. 1, also requires that store owners maintain proper documentation of the backgrounds of the dogs, cats and rabbits they sell.\n\nHawaii legalizes physician-assisted suicide\n\nHawaii\u2019s new law allowing physician-assisted suicide took effect on Tuesday.\n\nTobacco targeted in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some states and cities are taking aim at tobacco products this year.\n\nSmoking will be banned at all New Jersey public beaches and parks starting in July.\n\nIn New York City, a new ordinance bans pharmacies from selling cigarettes and other tobacco products. And Massachusetts has raised the minimum age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21.\n\nNonbinary people can list their gender as \u2018X\u2019 in NYC\n\nPeople who identify as neither male nor female can now list their gender as \u201cX\u201d on birth certificates in New York City.\n\nNew Jersey requires all residents to have health insurance\n\nA health insurance law in New Jersey that came into effect on Jan. 1 requires residents to maintain coverage or pay a penalty. It\u2019s the second state in the country, after Massachusetts, to enact an individual health insurance mandate.\n\nVermont is paying remote workers to move there\n\nIn an effort to promote economic growth, Vermont has offered to pay some remote workers to relocate to the state.\n\nQualified applicants can each apply for up to $10,000 in funding. The state has earmarked $500,000 for the initiative, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHunters in Illinois can wear pink if they want to\n\nNot into the usual \u201cblaze orange\u201d? Hunters in Illinois can now wear equally eye-catching \u201cblaze pink\u201d under a new law.\n\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) said the new shade could be even more effective in helping hunters stand out.\n\n\u201c[In the fall] we\u2019re hunting in trees and in some fields, there are orange leaves. There is orange in the background, so it\u2019s not always easy to see orange,\u201d Rauner said, according to the Illinois News Network. \u201cSo we\u2019re adding blaze pink to be one of the colors.\u201d\n\nExpand your hunting wardrobe: blaze pink joins blaze orange as an official hunting color starting Jan. 1.

In some states, minimum wages will go up, guns will be harder to obtain, plastic straws will get the boot and hunters will get to wear pink for a change.\n\nHere are some of the noteworthy laws going into effect this year:\n\nTighter gun restrictions in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last February, thousands of protesters across the nation demanded stricter gun control measures.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school last year, California passed several measures to prevent domestic abusers and people with mental illness from obtaining guns. Californians who are involuntarily committed to a mental institution twice in a year, or who are convicted of certain domestic violence offenses, could face a lifetime gun ownership ban.\n\nUnder an expanded Oregon law that went into effect on Jan. 1, domestic abuse offenders or people under restraining orders are banned from owning or purchasing a gun. In Illinois, authorities now have the right to seize firearms from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others. A similar \u201cred flag\u201d law will go into effect in New Jersey later this year.\n\nAt least six states \u2014 California, Washington, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont \u2014 and the District of Columbia are raising the minimum age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of long guns this year, CNBC reported.\n\nWashington state will also be enforcing several other gun control measures, including enhanced background checks, secure gun storage laws and a requirement for gun purchasers to provide proof they\u2019ve undergone firearm safety training.\n\nNew \u2018Me Too\u2019 laws\n\nAP In 2018, the Me Too movement spurred many people to come forward with their stories of sexual harassment and abuse -- and prompted several states to pass new laws targeting sexual violence.\n\nSeveral states are taking aim at workplace sexual harassment. California has banned nondisclosure provisions in settlements involving claims of sexual assault, harassment or discrimination based on sex. California employers will also no longer be allowed to compel workers to sign nondisparagement agreements as a condition of employment or in exchange for a raise or bonus.\n\nBy the end of 2019, publicly held corporations in the Golden State will also need to have at least one woman on their board of directors. Depending on the size of the board, corporations will need to increase that number to at least two or three female board members by the end of 2021.\n\nIn New York, all employees will be required to complete annual sexual harassment prevention training. Larger businesses in Delaware will have to provide such training to their workers, and legislators and their staff in Virginia will need to undergo such training every year.\n\nMinimum wages get a boost\n\nThough the federal minimum wage has languished at $7.25 since 2009, at least 19 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Washington, will be raising their minimum wages this year. Each will boost its minimum wage to at least $12. Some cities like New York, Seattle and Palo Alto, California, will see their wage floors increase to $15.\n\nSo long straws and stirrers!\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Under a new California law, restaurant customers will have to explicitly ask for a plastic straw if they want to use one.\n\nAs public awareness mounts of the hazards of plastic waste pollution, cities and states around the country have been targeting a major source of the problem: single-use plastic products like straws and food containers.\n\nA new law in New York City bars restaurants, stores and manufacturers from using most foam products, including takeout containers, cups and packing peanuts.\n\nEateries in the District of Columbia are now prohibited from giving out single-use plastic straws and stirrers. In California, restaurant patrons will need to ask explicitly for a plastic straw if they want to use one. Restaurants can be fined $25 a day for serving beverages with plastic straws that aren\u2019t requested by customers.\n\nFormer felons in Florida can head to the voting booth\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In November, Florida voted to approve a ballot measure that enabled more than 1 million former felons to regain their voting rights.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Florida will restore the voting rights of all former felons except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. Some 1.4 million possible voters will be added to the rolls \u2014 an addition that could have a significant effect on elections in the swing state.\n\nUtah implements strictest DUI law in the country\n\nUtah has lowered its blood alcohol content standard for drunk driving to 0.05 percent \u2014 the lowest limit in the country.\n\nUnder the new law, a driver who exceeds that limit and causes the death of another person will be charged with criminal homicide, a felony offense.\n\nAs CNN notes, all other U.S. states have a blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.08 percent for noncommercial drivers. Since at least 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board has been pushing to lower the limit to 0.05 nationwide.\n\nPets to get more rights in California\n\nPets in California will no longer be treated by courts as physical property in divorce cases. Instead, judges can decide who gets custody of the family pet.\n\nUnder a separate California law, pet stores will no longer be allowed to sell cats, dogs or rabbits that aren\u2019t from animal shelters or nonprofit rescue groups. That law, which took effect on Jan. 1, also requires that store owners maintain proper documentation of the backgrounds of the dogs, cats and rabbits they sell.\n\nHawaii legalizes physician-assisted suicide\n\nHawaii\u2019s new law allowing physician-assisted suicide took effect on Tuesday.\n\nTobacco targeted in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some states and cities are taking aim at tobacco products this year.\n\nSmoking will be banned at all New Jersey public beaches and parks starting in July.\n\nIn New York City, a new ordinance bans pharmacies from selling cigarettes and other tobacco products. And Massachusetts has raised the minimum age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21.\n\nNonbinary people can list their gender as \u2018X\u2019 in NYC\n\nPeople who identify as neither male nor female can now list their gender as \u201cX\u201d on birth certificates in New York City.\n\nNew Jersey requires all residents to have health insurance\n\nA health insurance law in New Jersey that came into effect on Jan. 1 requires residents to maintain coverage or pay a penalty. It\u2019s the second state in the country, after Massachusetts, to enact an individual health insurance mandate.\n\nVermont is paying remote workers to move there\n\nIn an effort to promote economic growth, Vermont has offered to pay some remote workers to relocate to the state.\n\nQualified applicants can each apply for up to $10,000 in funding. The state has earmarked $500,000 for the initiative, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHunters in Illinois can wear pink if they want to\n\nNot into the usual \u201cblaze orange\u201d? Hunters in Illinois can now wear equally eye-catching \u201cblaze pink\u201d under a new law.\n\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) said the new shade could be even more effective in helping hunters stand out.\n\n\u201c[In the fall] we\u2019re hunting in trees and in some fields, there are orange leaves.

Disclosing these dealbreakers is often delightfully subtle and insignificant (e.g., I snore, I don\u2019t cook, I\u2019m sloppy and so on). It can also end a relationship \u2014 smoking, not wanting kids, infidelity ... so, what\u2019s my dating dealbreaker?\n\nI had a double mastectomy and don\u2019t have real boobs.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for just a second. I have a mutated BRCA1 gene, otherwise frightfully known as the \u201cbreast cancer gene.\u201d As its name suggests, having the mutation made my lifetime risk of getting breast cancer skyrocket up to 87 percent. That, and my family history of breast cancer put my depressing odds into clear context, and the logical plan of action was to simply slice my breasts off. This would reduce my risk of getting breast cancer to less than one percent ... so I had a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.\n\nIn July 2018, at 25 years old, I parted ways with my real boobs at a hospital in Kansas. Two additional surgeries later, and my body is beginning to heal \u2013 which has unfortunately allowed the emotional toll of this process to finally rear its ugly head.\n\nWhile nothing about this has been easy, I found myself immensely struggling in the dating realm after the surgery. I had just had my real breasts cut off, and it was really doing a number on my relationship-potential conviction. I failed to summon the confidence needed to swipe away on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. The single men in the real world were seemingly few and far between, and knowingly approaching them seemed unimaginable after my mastectomy.\n\nThe first time I told a prospective suitor that I had had a double mastectomy, I had done so with apologetic undertones.\n\nThe first time I told a prospective suitor that I had had a double mastectomy, I had done so with apologetic undertones and a slight curve of the spine \u2014 a direct reflection of my self-assurance (or lack thereof).\n\nBut how could I feel confident when I was wholeheartedly embarrassed by the jagged, pink scars on my underboob? How could I take a man home with me when I was worried that the silicone implants would feel unpleasantly rock hard and artificial under his fingertips? How could I be intimate with a man when I felt anything but beautiful because of my new chest?\n\nI was afraid that a man would take one look at my bare breasts and find any excuse to avoid being intimate with me \u2014 so I remained single and resorted to my vibrator often.\n\nWhether I wanted to sleep with a man or not, the hesitancy and fear of being immediately rejected because of my mastectomy remained stronger than my desire to get laid or date someone. My sex life was certainly thrown a nasty and confusing curveball because of this fear, and I avoided getting into bed with anyone \u2014 unless I had a handful of vodka sodas coursing through me, of course. My liquid courage allowed me to be intimate with the lights on and my bra off. I may have been clumsy, but I was confident.\n\nIf the opportunity for sex presented itself and I was sober, the lights remained off, and my bra stayed on. More importantly, the contempt I had for my new body became impossible to ignore without being buzzed. It was also unrealistic to think that each time I did want to be intimate with a person and not loathe my aesthetic, I would need a drink or two \u2014 unless I towed a flask around in my cleavage or something.\n\nMy mastectomy presented me with other sad realities I didn\u2019t have to face until I was in bed with another, like the loss of sensation in my nipples. There was a time where these two, pink protuberances played the most substantial part in my sex life \u2014 they were the key to my arousal. Now, I feel nothing at all. I knew before having the double mastectomy that I would lose sensation, but no one can prepare you for how heartbreaking this loss will actually be until a man\u2019s tongue is circling your areola and you don\u2019t feel a thing.\n\nMy mastectomy presented me with other sad realities I didn\u2019t have to face until I was in bed with another, like the loss of sensation in my nipples.\n\nI felt broken, and I convinced myself that a man inside me would put me back together again \u2014 that some type of sexual approval would make me confident enough to be with another. Indulging in such an act was proof that I was not falling apart; that I didn\u2019t hate my body; that I was normal and everything was fine.\n\nI\u2019m fine, yet I still fantasized about having sex pre-double mastectomy.\n\nWhen I find myself dejected over the loss of my breasts and every other turmoil that comes along with having the BRCA1 mutation, I remind myself that it could always be worse. For starters, I never had breast cancer. I also have breasts, even if they are fake. Though my nipples may \u201cfeel\u201d nonexistent, they are there \u2014 and they are mine. So many women are not this lucky, and while there are days I could wrap myself in a blanket and my insecurities and sulk in my sadness, I know that I am ultimately a fortunate woman: a woman who deserves to get laid, regardless of my new perky (creepy) breasts.\n\nAfter my double mastectomy, I certainly haven\u2019t finalized a pickup line. I have yet to master the art of dating, and I\u2019m still incredibly awkward when it comes to telling a man about my surgery, but I am not ashamed, either. I took my health into my hands and am the sole decider if I get breast cancer \u2014 and now, I likely never will.\n\nAt the end of the day, my fake breasts are not dealbreakers. I\u2019m vegan, astonishingly loud, and detest country music \u2014 if you want to know my dealbreakers, those are likely them.

Mr. Lighthizer \u2014 who described his own negotiating style as \u201cknowing where the leverage is\u201d during a 1984 interview \u2014 typically presents few specific demands during initial talks while publicly bashing efforts by the other side.\n\nHe used that approach during recent talks with Canada and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement, criticizing foreign counterparts as intransigent and characterizing complaints by American businesses as pure greed."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Mitt Romney Faces Counterattacks From Trump Allies", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/mitt-romney-trump-republicans.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Romney\u2019s broadside, published just before he is to be sworn in as the junior senator from his current home state of Utah, represented the latest turn in an on-and-off political feud between the two men that dates back to Mr. Romney\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. And it amounted to a blunt reminder to Mr. Trump that one of his most outspoken Republican critics would soon have a high-profile platform in Washington \u2014 at a moment when series of investigations have engulfed the White House and Democrats are about to take control of the House.\n\nSensing the makings of a primary threat to the president, some of his most ardent backers on the R.N.C. began making the case that the party\u2019s rules be changed to ensure Mr. Trump\u2019s renomination in 2020.\n\nCalling Mr. Romney\u2019s attack \u201ccalculated political treachery,\u201d Jevon Williams, the national committeeman from the Virgin Islands, wrote in an email to other members of the Republican National Committee that the party should move to protect Mr. Trump by amending party rules to make it harder for a challenger to have his named place in nomination at the G.O.P.\u2019s 2020 convention.\n\nAnd, Mr. Williams wrote, the party should use its winter meeting this month to pass a resolution endorsing Mr. Trump and declaring him \u201cthe presumptive nominee in 2020.\u201d\n\nAnd other Republicans saw Mr. Romney\u2019s offensive as an opening to nurture their ties with Mr. Trump, who keeps close tabs on who defends him in the media.

Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.\n\nDefining an institution\u2019s role\n\nFounded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering was the first hospital in the country devoted exclusively to treating cancer. Its benefactors have included some of the wealthiest families in America, from the Astors and Rockefellers in its early years to the Kochs today.\n\nIt now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.\n\nAs a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.\n\nBut some on the hospital\u2019s board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center\u2019s chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were \u201clying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Treatment Gap: In Rehab, \u2018Two Warring Factions\u2019: Abstinence vs. Medication", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit \u2014 an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry\u2019s role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "In Screening for Suicide Risk, Facebook Takes On Tricky Public Health Role", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/facebook-suicide-screening-algorithm.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "A police officer on the late shift in an Ohio town recently received an unusual call from Facebook.\n\nEarlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case.

Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital \u2014 either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook\u2019s intervention.

It now utilizes both algorithms and user reports to flag possible suicide threats.\n\nFacebook\u2019s rise as a global arbiter of mental distress puts the social network in a tricky position at a time when it is under investigation for privacy lapses by regulators in the United States, Canada and the European Union \u2014 as well as facing heightened scrutiny for failing to respond quickly to election interference and ethnic hatred campaigns on its site.

For older adults alone, this increased health care costs by 46 percent over a period of 10 years, compared with costs incurred by those without hearing loss, the authors reported in November in JAMA Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nOne of the authors, Jennifer A. Deal, an epidemiologist and gerontologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while \u201chearing loss itself is not very expensive, the effect of hearing loss on everything else is expensive.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, people tend to wait much too long to get their hearing tested and treated with hearing aids, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to treat hearing loss, Dr. Lin told me.\n\nAge-related hearing loss comes on really slowly, making it harder for people to know when to take it seriously, he said. He cited two good clues to when to get your hearing tested: Family members or close friends say you should, or you notice that you often mishear or don\u2019t know what others are saying.\n\nBut even when people are tested and spend thousands of dollars to purchase needed hearing aids, the devices often sit in a drawer. People may complain that the sound quality is poor, too static-y or otherwise annoying, and that the aids merely amplify all sound, making it still hard to hear in a noisy environment. All aids are not created equal, Dr. Lin said, and even expensive, properly fitted aids can require multiple adjustments. Some people give up too readily to get the best results.\n\n\u201cUnrealistic expectations are a big part of this problem,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting on a pair of glasses that immediately enables you to see clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing loss is not fixed as easily as eyesight. The brain needs time \u2014 a good month or two \u2014 to adjust to hearing aids. And the earlier hearing loss is treated, the easier it is for the brain to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe new studies give ample cause for taking hearing loss seriously. Consider, for example, the link to dementia. People who can\u2019t hear well often become socially isolated and deprived of stimuli that keep the brain cognitively engaged. As input lessens, so does brain function."}]
