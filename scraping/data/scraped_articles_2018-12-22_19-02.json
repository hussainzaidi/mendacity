The move provoked the resignations of his most admired Cabinet officer, Defense Secretary James Mattis, who penned a devastating critique of Trump's \"America First\" world view, and a day later, of Trump's special envoy in the ISIS fight, Brett McGurk\n\nA surprise announcement that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery for cancerous growths on her lung added to the frenetic mood in Washington, as the Supreme Court dealt a blow to Trump by knocking back his new restrictions on asylum seekers who cross the southern border.\n\nThe sense of things slipping out of control on multiple fronts left the political world more unsettled and on edge than at any other time in Trump's tumultuous presidency.\n\nEven Republicans who have rarely dared to the cross the President fumed that Trump appeared to navigate himself into a no-win situation with the government shutdown, and border wall funding prospects that will only worsen once Democrats take control of the House in a couple of weeks.\n\n\"We are pretty much flying here without an instruction book,\" said Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt.\n\nTrump, who bowed to a right-wing revolt and forced the fight by digging in on a dispute over funding for his border wall, addressed the crisis by tweeting a picture of himself signing already-passed bills -- a number of which concerned the naming of post offices -- while also complaining that he was staying in Washington instead of heading out on his 16-day Florida golf vacation as planned.\n\nThat was after one senator, Democrat Brian Schatz from Hawaii, flew all the way home to have what he tweeted was a \"17 minute visit\" with his family before hopping back on a plane to rejoin the Senate's latest round of brinksmanship.\n\n\"Wheels down IAD ready to vote no on this stupid wall,\" he tweeted when he got back.\n\nAt midnight on Friday, the government slipped into a partial shutdown after Congress declined to bow to Trump's demands for $5 billion in taxpayer cash for a border wall that he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for. Negotiations between the White House and Democrats are expected to go on throughout the weekend in the hope of ending the shutdown before Christmas.\n\n\"OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!\" Trump tweeted on Friday night along with a video in which he demanded a \"great barrier\" to stop what he said were gangs and criminals pouring across the border\n\nA White House official told CNN's Pamela Brown that while staffers are used to chaos, this time around \"it feels different.\"\n\n'Craziness' going on\n\nShock and dread hung over the four-mile power corridor between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill over the sensational resignation of Mattis, long seen as a crucial restraint on an erratic commander in chief.\n\nTrump was reported to be \"angry\" about the resignation letter. But the President's plans to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan that pushed Mattis to quit were still reverberating around the world, with Turkish officials threatening retaliation against the Kurds, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIn another example of Trump's apparent desire to flex executive power, Trump is asking advisers whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell. Two people familiar with the matter described the President as furious at the Fed chief following the latest interest rate hike at a time when markets are tumbling. So far the White House has not made a final legal determination on the matter.\n\nThe story, first reported by Bloomberg, came after CNN revealed that Trump is also furious with his acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker after federal prosecutors referenced the President's actions in crimes to which his former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAmid the uproar, it went almost unnoticed that Whitaker decided to ignore a recommendation from senior Justice Department ethics officials to recuse himself from the Russia probe -- a revelation that comes after prosecutors in New York indicated Trump directed Cohen to make illicit hush money payments before the 2016 election, and as Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn is still awaiting sentencing from a judge who told Flynn he \"arguably sold your country out\" through his dealings with foreign powers.\n\nWhitaker may have been unwilling to risk the President's wrath after watching his former boss Jeff Sessions get relentlessly attacked and finally fired over his recusal in the probe. But Whitaker's decision will exacerbate fears about the exposure of special counsel Robert Mueller to presidential interference.\n\nTrump's case of humbug can hardly have been helped when the Supreme Court upheld a ban on his new asylum restrictions \u2014 with one of his recent Twitter targets, Chief Justice John Roberts, siding with the court's liberal wing to cast the deciding vote. Trump later tweeted well wishes to Ginsburg for \"a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nA grim run on Wall Street is deepening a feeling of vulnerability this holiday season.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped another 400 plus points, to enshrine its worst weekly plunge since the crisis year of 2008, while the Nasdaq retreated into a bear market in the worst December for stocks since the Great Depression.\n\nThe White House official who was in contact with CNN's Brown said that with the impending departures of both Chief of Staff John Kelly and Mattis, there is a feeling that the guardrails are coming off. The official says \"of course it's crazy. Anyone looking at this has got to think there's some craziness going on.\"\n\nThe source also said there is uncertainty among staffers about what Mick Mulvaney will do as chief of staff, adding that a lot of people inside the West Wing are looking at what has happened the last 48 hours and wondering if that is indicative of what else is to come.\n\nThe source added there's a sense that the President is not listening as much to certain advisers as much as he once did, including Kelly and Mattis. There have been several recent examples of the President making a decision only to change his mind after receiving outside influence.\n\nOne case in point: his shift over the short-term funding bill following pressure from outside conservatives like Ann Coulter.\n\n'Blindsiding the swamp'\n\nWhile everything seemed tenuous in Washington, it's not clear that an almost tangible sense of foreboding was shared across the nation.\n\nAfter all, nearly half the country voted for this. Trump's political base elected him to send the political establishment reeling and to unpick the alliance systems and international commitments that have underpinned US leadership of the Western world for Trump's entire life.\n\nThe President has anchored his White House on the unshakable support of his most loyal supporters, never bothering to reach out to other Americans to build a wider coalition.\n\nHad he been keen to broaden his support ahead of his 2020 election race, Trump might have spent the last week trading his border wall fight for a prolonged victory lap for a first step towards a criminal justice overhaul. A more normal White House would have made sure not to step on what was a significant political win.\n\nThe President signed the rare bipartisan bill on Friday in an Oval Office tableau surrounded by members of Congress who congratulated him at length for getting something done. But his celebration was quickly overshadowed by all the other raging storylines, not least his own decision to return to his demands funding for a border wall. As the government headed into a shutdown Friday, Trump tweeted designs for a border barrier made up of steel slats which he said was \"totally effective while at the same time beautiful!\"\n\nEarlier in the week, it seemed that Trump would agree to a spending bill to keep the government fully open into next year without wall funding.\n\nBut stung by a backlash by House conservatives and conservative pundits who accused him of caving in his last best chance to build the wall given the incoming House Democratic majority, he abruptly changed course.\n\n\"People are expecting, Americans are expecting, that a Republican President, along with his Republican House and Senate will have an end game,\" said Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski.\n\nBut Trump's cheerleaders in conservative media were delighted by his disruptive tactics.\n\n\"Donald Trump blindsided the swamp yesterday,\" said Rush Limbaugh in his show-opening monologue on Friday.\n\nLate in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared in the chamber to announce that there would be renewed efforts to forge a deal between Democrats and Republicans, the House and the Senate and the White House to avert a government shutdown. He wore on his lapel a badge featuring a reindeer and the slogan \"Senate cranky coalition.\"\n\nEven the deadpan Kentuckian couldn't resist a chuckle when he uttered the words that formally put the Senate in limbo so negotiations could take place.\n\n\"I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695.\"\n\nThe impenetrable congressional jargon only added to perceptions of that a Washington farce is unfolding this Christmas."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Congress searches for deal to end partial government shutdown", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/OQ0ZEGInrWA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Lawmakers convened Saturday on Capitol Hill to continue negotiations on a spending deal just hours after members of Congress and President Donald Trump failed to come to an agreement, resulting in the third government shutdown of the year.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on the Senate floor Saturday that there would be no action on the floor until Trump and Senate Democrats come to an agreement.\n\nMcConnell said the Senate was, in the meantime, pushing \"the pause button\" while the two parties attempt to work out a deal.\n\nHe then began discussing the importance of border security and \"securing the homeland.\"\n\nOn Friday, Vice President Mike Pence, budget director Mick Mulvaney and the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, came to Capitol Hill, where they stayed into the evening after both the House and Senate adjourned for the night.\n\nAny bill to re-open the government will need 60 votes to pass the Senate because of procedural rules, meaning Republicans will need some Democratic votes.\n\nFunding for roughly a quarter of the federal government expired at midnight, including appropriations for the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Housing and Urban Development and other parts of the government. This is the first time in 40 years that the government will have been closed three times in a year.\n\nThe funding legislation that earlier this week seemed certain to pass both chambers was thrown into limbo on Thursday when Trump told House GOP members he would not sign a bill unless it included $5 billion to fund a border wall.\n\nDespite the House of Representatives passing a bill on Thursday, which included this demand, it was clear on Friday that there was not enough support in the Senate for the bill, including the $5 billion for the wall, to clear.\n\nFriday night, a path forward appeared ambiguous, as all sides seemed stagnant in their demands days before the Christmas holiday, when Congress was expected to be out of session.\n\nRepublican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who was briefed by Pence, Kushner and Mulvaney on Friday, told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux on Saturday morning that the hope is McConnell will have a deal to announce when the Senate reconvenes at noon.\n\nThe debate between the White House and Congress focuses not just on how much money to allocate to border security, but also on the language stipulating where and how that money can be spent, he said.\n\n\"What is fencing, what is land ports of entry, what's technology, what's staffing?\" Lankford said. \"I think there's a general agreement ... that we need to do border security. Now's figuring out how much for each amount.\"\n\n\"Right now we're trying to finalize all the final text and to be able to make sure everyone's looked at it, everyone's agreed, signed off on it. ...\" he said. \"Then we'll move to a vote 24 hours from there.\"\n\nLankford also said he is \"confident\" that if Pence says the President is on board with any deal, Trump will keep to his word.\n\n\"We've agreed in the Senate we're not bringing anything to the floor until we know all three bodies have agreed to it,\" Lankford said. \"Then we can expedite it through the process on the floor.\"\n\nIf there's no an agreement, Lankford said he believes the American people will be looking at a much longer shutdown.\n\nA Senate Democratic aide said Saturday that talks continue at the staff level and confirmed that any deal will need signoff from congressional leadership and Trump before it comes to a vote. Democrats continue to push for border security options that they believe work, rather than a wall. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has insisted to Pence and Republicans that the President must sign off on that before a vote.\n\nTrump earlier on Friday predicted a shut down, but placed the blame on Democrats, saying \"it's really the Democrat shutdown, because we've done our thing.\n\n\"The chances are probably very good\" that there is a shutdown,\" Trump said Friday afternoon.\n\nHe later added: \"Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we're totally prepared for a very long shutdown.\"\n\nAnd in a White House-produced video posted on Twitter two hours before the government was partially closed, Trump said, \"We're going to have a shutdown. There's nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes.\" He added, \"The shutdown hopefully will not last long.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Schumer threw the blame back at Trump and Republican lawmakers in a joint statement shortly after midnight, saying if \"this Trump shutdown\" continued, \"the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January.\"\n\nWhen he appeared to be leaving on Friday night, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \"constructive talks are underway.\"\n\nWhen he was asked if he would be coming back to participate in the talks, the Kentucky Republican said, \"as I've said repeatedly, we need Democratic votes and presidential signature.\"\n\nA person familiar with Pence, Kushner and Mulvaney's five-hour trip to the Capitol said they made it clear that the initial request that included just $1.6 billion for the wall wasn't going to cut it.\n\n\"There is no quick end to this,\" said one source with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nIf a deal is to be reached, votes could happen as early as Sunday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Schumer's message to Trump: Abandon the wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/WzDChkpLH2s/h_842343127b20c5ffd56b66adb0ff5cd1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed President Donald Trump while speaking on the Senate floor Saturday, saying, \"President Trump, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall \u2013 plain and simple.\u201d\n\nSchumer said that Trump must publicly say he will support any agreement, saying he wants to avoid what happened earlier in the week when there were indications from White House aides that the President would sign a stop gap spending measure but then said he would not.\n\nWhile Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier said any agreement would need the support of both the President and Senate Democrats, Schumer said McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan must also support it publicly.\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell can\u2019t duck out of it,\u201d Schumer said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Don Lemon stumps panel with shutdown question", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/AK1153UGIV4/government-shutdown-question-stumps-panel-ctn-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

A CNN poll conducted earlier this month found that only 38% of Americans favored a wall, with 57% opposed. Either way, the average result is Americans clearly not wanting a wall.\n\nWhat's the point: President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans wanted a partial government shutdown because Congress has not passed a funding bill that allocates what Trump and some Republicans deem adequate money for a border wall with Mexico.\n\nTrump and these Republicans seem to be doubling down on a belief that politics is all about the base. Trump really pushed for a partial shutdown only after getting hammered by conservative media . This bashing came following reports that he was not pushing hard for wall funding.\n\nIn this case, conservative media is representing the Republican electorate well. The Quinnipiac poll, for example, showed that 86% of Republicans wanted the border wall. Indeed, Trump won the Republican primary in 2016 in large part because of his tough immigration stance.\n\nThe problem is that national elections are not all about the base. Yes, the base is important, but it's also key to win over voters in the center of the electorate. Trump almost certainly needs to pick up the support of more voters if he is going to win in 2020. His overall approval rating remains in the low 40s.\n\nThe wall is exactly the type of issue that harms Trump's chance of becoming popular with the center. Last year, I looked at a slew of potentially controversial policy stances. The wall was the most polarizing . It is opposed by a majority of independents and by 90% of Democrats, according to Quinnipiac.\n\nDon't believe me about the wall not being a political winner for Republicans? The midterm elections were just a test about whether Trump could use harsh immigration rhetoric to rally voters to his side. Immigration may have saved Republicans a deep red Senate seat for the Republicans, but in the House (where all voters got to cast ballots) it was a disaster.\n\nAccording to a report compiled by David Winston , a Republican pollster, the focus on immigration instead of the economy resulted in late deciders breaking for the Democrats by double-digits points in 2018. Winston's findings line up with what Democrats saw in their own polling per the Washington Examiner's David Drucker\n\nTrump may like to believe that the midterm outcome was somehow not a reflection on his policies. Remember, though, that the 2018 midterm was the most presidential-centric in modern history . A higher percentage of those who approved of the President's job performance voted for the President's party than ever before in a midterm. A higher percentage of those who disapproved of Trump's job voted for the opposition party than ever before in a midterm.\n\nThe overall House result was that Democrats won a plurality of the vote in states, making up 329 electoral votes to the Republicans' 206. This calculation, done by Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, importantly takes into account how seats where there was either no Democrat or no Republican on the ballot would have voted if there had been one. Democrats \"won\" a plurality of the House vote in almost all the swing states that Trump won in 2016, including Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nI wouldn't expect the shutdown to play out differently with regard to immigration. In the Quinnipiac poll, only 34% of voters favor a shutdown because of disagreements over funding for the wall. When asked who would get blamed for a shutdown, 51% said congressional Republicans and the President, compared with 37% who said congressional Democrats. A Suffolk University poll out this week came up with similar results.\n\nThe shutdown may please the base. It looks like a political loser overall, however. Perhaps more worrisome for Republicans, it doesn't look like Trump learned a single thing from Republicans losing in the midterms."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Pope Francis tells clerics who abuse minors to turn themselves in", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/IVUOc0tElw0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Rome (CNN) Pope Francis has told those who abuse minors to hand themselves in to civil justice authorities and \"prepare for divine justice,\" in his strongest words to date on the sex abuse crisis roiling the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn his annual speech to the Vatican's Curia on Friday morning, the Pope also thanked the media for exposing the sex abuse crisis and encouraged survivors to speak out.\n\n\"I myself would like to give heartfelt thanks to those media professionals who were honest and objective and sought to unmask these predators and to make their victims' voices heard,\" the Pope said.\n\n\"The Church asks that people not be silent... since the greater scandal in this matter is that of cloaking the truth,\" he said.\n\n\"To those who abuse minors I would say this -- convert and hand yourself over to human justice and prepare for divine justice.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "British woman allegedly raped in Indian tourist hotspot", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/m7SjBdFVRe4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "New Delhi (CNN) A 31-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping a British woman in the western Indian state of Goa.\n\nThe victim was walking back to her hotel on Thursday in the popular tourist destination when the incident took place, according to Rajendra Dessai, a police officer at the Canacona police station in southern Goa.\n\n\"The incident was reported very early in the morning, at around 4:30 a.m,\" Dessai said. \"There is a slightly lonely spot on the road there and that is where the man was.\n\n\"He took her into the fields and raped her and then he took her bags with him.\"\n\nThe accused has been arrested on suspicion of rape and robbery, Dessai added.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "From Shanghai to Frankfurt, these 8 stock indices are in bear markets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/1qXAxMLhSM8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN Business) Global markets are having a rough 2018.

Today, it's struggling to stay afloat.\n\nBacked by billions of dollars from high-profile investors like Alibaba ( BABA ), Ofo helped pioneer the dockless bike-sharing phenomenon that swept across Chinese cities in recent years. The bikes can be locked and unlocked anywhere via a smartphone app, which means users don't have to return them to designated stations.\n\nOfo fended off dozens of copycat rivals, but it now risks becoming the latest casualty of a cut-throat industry. Hordes of angry customers gathered outside its headquarters in Beijing this week to demand refunds. The company and its founder have been put on a government black list for failing to pay debts.\n\n\"They snapped defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Jeffrey Towson, a private equity investor and professor at Peking University.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nOfo users lined up outside the bike sharing company's headquarters this week, demanding refunds.\n\nStruggling to keep up\n\nBike-sharing startups in China burned through cash as they rushed to launch services in cities throughout the country and overseas. The chaotic expansion resulted in a string of bankruptcies and huge piles of impounded bikes.\n\nOfo survived that shakeout, but has struggled to keep up with its rivals since.\n\nDockless bike sharing was a great standalone service when it launched in 2015, but it now makes more sense for companies like Ofo to team up with other transportation platforms, analysts say.\n\nThese days, people want to use one app where \"you can hail a scooter or a bike or a car,\" said Tu Le, founder of consulting firm Sino Auto Insights. \"That's where the sweet spot's going to be.\"\n\nOfo's rivals have already adapted to the shifting landscape.\n\nMobike was acquired in April by a bigger tech startup, Meituan Dianping, while Hellobike joined forces with digital payments giant Ant Financial. Both Meituan and Ant offer a wide range of services though their apps, which are used by hundreds of millions of people in China.\n\nThe partnerships gave Ofo's rivals access to more users and also allowed them to offer their users a greater variety of services, such as ride-hailing and food delivery.\n\nThousands of Ofo and Mobike's bikes were impounded in Shanghai last year. Authorities said they breached parking restrictions.\n\nAll alone\n\nIndustry watchers expected Ofo to be acquired by its big ride-hailing backer, Didi Chuxing, the company that drove Uber out of China. But that never happened.\n\nInstead, Didi snapped up another bike-sharing company, Bluegogo.\n\n\"When Didi suddenly bought Bluegogo and launched their own bike-sharing service, that was a red flag,\" Towson said. \"That's like when your wife tells you she's starting to date again.\"\n\nOfo suffered another big blow in July when Mobike said users no longer need to pay deposits for its services. Hellobike soon followed suit.\n\nWithout a deep-pocketed partner, Ofo couldn't afford to take the same step. Investor enthusiasm had waned, cash was low because of its costly global expansion and suppliers were beginning to demand payment.\n\nThe startup also struggled to repair damaged bikes, according to Xue Yu, an analyst at research firm IDC. That made it harder for its customers to find available bikes, prompting them to switch to its competitors.\n\nOfo is now \"suffering the most serious consumer crisis of trust,\" Xue said.\n\nOfo bikes waiting for repair in Beijing last year.\n\nFounder talks of bankruptcy\n\nIts founder Dai Wei said in a letter to employees Wednesday that because of the startup's financial crisis, he had \"even thought about dissolving the company and filing for bankruptcy so that you don't have to continue to bear such pressures.\"\n\n\"Recently, the pressure from cash flow and the media has made us feel powerless,\" Dai wrote in the letter, which was shared on Chinese social media and translated by Tech In Asia . An Ofo spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the letter and the accuracy of the translation but declined to comment further.\n\nBeing on the government blacklist means Ofo and Dai face restrictions including not being allowed to buy plane tickets or rent space in high-end office buildings.\n\nOfo said it will refund deposits and is asking users to be patient. More than 12.3 million people were waiting for refunds on Friday, according to its app.\n\nSome disgruntled users have lined up outside Ofo's Beijing headquarters this week, demanding a refund of their deposits, which range from 99 to 199 yuan ($14 to $28). Some of them became emotional on Friday, yelling at security guards and police officers who were keeping watch over the crowd.\n\nMany Ofo users have also sounded off on social media, saying they doubt they'll ever get a refund.\n\n'Just a fad'\n\nThe public outcry has prompted a response from government officials.\n\nMinistry of Transportation spokesperson Wu Chungen on Friday urged Ofo to reduce spending to ensure it can pay back users and also to speed up the refund process.\n\nBut it also called on people to be more supportive of Ofo.\n\n\"Let's be more tolerant and leave room for trials and errors for new things,\" Wu said. \"This way we can help create a big environment that encourages innovation and development.\"\n\nZhang Xinyuan, a 37-year-old Ofo customer was standing outside the company's headquarters on Friday hoping to get her deposit back.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, Zhang said she will still feel she got her money's worth riding the \"little yellow bikes,\" referring to the company's Chinese nickname.\n\n\"I kind of saw it coming,\" she said of Ofo's troubles. \"I thought the little yellow bike was just a fad.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Dow suffers worst week since 2008 financial crisis", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/L-vjUeCkNDc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) The Dow just suffered its deepest weekly plunge since 2008 and the Nasdaq is officially in a bear market.\n\nThe miserable performance reflects deepening fears on Wall Street of an economic slowdown and overly-aggressive Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Dow closed 414 points, or 1.8%, lower on Friday.

That's the steepest weekly percentage loss since October 2008. The Nasdaq plunged 8.4% on the week, its worst since November 2008.

Political chaos from Brexit, a looming US government shutdown and the resignation of US Defense Secretary James Mattis are stoking fear, too. And the Federal Reserve added to those concerns this week by signaling that its rate-increase plan will continue into 2019 despite downgrading its economic growth forecast.\n\n\"We see slowing economic and earnings growth and a carousel of concerns,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust, in a note to investors Friday.\n\nBut investors have some reason for optimism. The S&P 500 is trading at just 14.5 times next year's expected earnings. That's far lower than the historical average of 16 times earnings, suggesting that the sell-off has been overdone . Stocks are cheap, presenting buying opportunities for smart investors willing to take on a bit of risk.\n\nA temporary moment of excitement\n\nThe stock market took off early Friday after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told CNBC that the Fed will remain flexible about its rate-raising and balance sheet policy if the markets take a turn for the worse.\n\n\"We would use all available tools\" if the economy got significantly worse, Williams said, though he didn't predict the economy would turn south and pledged the Fed would \"take the right policy decision to keep this economy strong.\"\n\n\"We're going to go into the new year with eyes wide open,\" he said. \"The market is telling us pretty clearly there are these downside risks we need to be attuned to.\"\n\nWilliams acknowledged that the Fed now predicts somewhat slower economic growth than it had in the past, but he said the believes the market's selling is overdone."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Watch out FedEx and UPS.

Lying to a licensed gun dealer is a felony punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.\n\nBreaking that law might seem risky. But in September, a Government Accountability Office study made it clear why those who \"lie and try\" would take their chances. Regional offices at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives received 12,710 cases of firearm background check denials for further investigation in fiscal year 2017, the GAO found, but the government prosecuted only 12 people. More than 99.9% of those who were investigated escaped with nothing more than a warning.\n\nPast and present ATF agents and prosecutors told CNN that, given limited resources, they're not inclined to prioritize the nonviolent crime of lying on a form over more serious charges, like gun trafficking. The very few \"lie and try\" cases they prosecute focus on dangerous \"trigger pullers\" who clearly know they're prohibited from owning a firearm -- career criminals with a history of violence or activity in the drug trade.\n\nBut a 2006 internal ATF briefing paper obtained by CNN suggests that gun form liars are far more likely to go on to commit a gun crime than even many experts recognize. When ATF analyzed firearm denial cases sent to field offices for investigation during a seven-year period, it found that 10%-21% of that group went on to be arrested for a crime involving guns.\n\nTake John Zawahri, who tried to buy a gun at a California dealer in 2011. State investigators spotted at least one disqualifier -- he had been held at the UCLA hospital psychiatric ward as a violence-prone teen. The California Department of Justice denied him the purchase.\n\nLike almost all gun-form liars, Zawahri was not prosecuted. Undeterred, he built his own semi-automatic rifle mostly from mail-order parts and, two years later, went on a rampage. On June 7, 2013, he set his home on fire, executed his father and older brother with shots to the chest, then hijacked a car to Santa Monica College and killed three others. Dozens of students and bystanders managed to survive by hiding behind restaurant tables and library doors. Police officers caught up to Zawahri at the college library, where they shot him 25 times in a gun battle.\n\nWould prosecution for having lied on a gun form have stopped Zawahri from building his own gun and going on to use it? \"I don't believe it would make a difference. There would have been some short jail term, or probation, and he still would have accumulated the gun parts in the two years after that,\" Santa Monica Homicide Detective Chad Goodwin told CNN.\n\nBut a surprising range of authorities have argued that enforcing \"lie and try\" could make a difference -- including not only anti-gun groups and criminal justice academics, but also former law enforcement officers, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration, and even the National Rifle Association. By failing to bring charges in cases like Zawahri's, the government is leaving thousands of lawbreakers without any new blemish to their names.\n\nLike almost all Americans who lie on federal gun forms, John Zawahri was not prosecuted. He was one of many gun form liars who go on to commit crimes with a gun.\n\nThat reduces the law's function as a deterrent to prohibited possessors who might hope to get lucky with the federal background check system. It also allows gun form liars to fly under the radar for law enforcement -- and to avoid being assigned a probation officer who would monitor them to make sure they didn't obtain a weapon. And, in the event of a later crime, it leaves what could have been a significant previous charge -- which might typically lead to more prison time -- off their records.\n\nDavid Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that prosecutors and law enforcement officials should rid themselves of the idea that lying on gun forms is a crime not worth pursuing. \"It's worthwhile to go after these cases. The prosecution in question here is failing to fill out a form accurately. That doesn't seem like a big deal. But prosecution is a means to an end -- getting dangerous people off the street.\"\n\nIn Zawahri's case, failure to prosecute probably meant that the young man's years-long obsession with guns and violence stayed below the notice of investigators. Instead, his name merely became one of thousands sitting on law enforcement lists of those who have tried to purchase guns illegally and failed.\n\nA low priority for overburdened agents\n\nWhen you try to buy a firearm at a licensed dealer, you must fill out a federal form that asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using any illegal drugs, subject to a restraining order, or inside the United States illegally. It also asks if you've previously been convicted of a felony or domestic violence, adjudicated \"as a mental defective,\" dishonorably discharged from the military, or if you've ever renounced US citizenship.\n\nIf you're prohibited and answer truthfully, a gun dealer is supposed to scrap the sale. If you lie, a subsequent background check conducted by law enforcement is supposed to find any disqualifiers in your record. Twenty-nine states and Washington DC rely on the FBI for all firearm sale background checks, 13 states do their own, and 8 split the work. Then the cases are referred to law enforcement: It's up to ATF to investigate federal background check denials, while local police handle state-level denials. After the law enforcement agents investigate, they present potential cases to local or federal prosecutors, who ultimately decide whether to charge someone with a crime.\n\nThe federal gun form asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using illegal drugs, or inside the United States illegally, among other things.\n\nThe federal form, and the penalty for false statements on it, is there to discourage prohibited possessors from trying to buy guns in the first place. But a person only breaks the law if a prosecutor can show they \"knowingly\" made a false statement. That can be difficult to prove. Some people who approach a gun shop counter might legitimately forget about a decades-old domestic violence conviction or a felony they committed as a teen, current and former ATF agents said.\n\nStill, even for someone who is perfectly aware they're a prohibited possessor, it can be worth trying to buy a gun, because so few cases meet US attorneys' standards for potential criminal prosecution. The federal background check system blocked 112,090 attempts to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017. About a tenth of them were referred to ATF field offices for further investigation.\n\nEven when ATF agents do discover a potential gun buyer committed a crime, US attorneys usually don't have the appetite to take on these cases. According to the recent GAO report, federal prosecutors rarely pursue criminal charges, due to a perception that trying these cases in court \"may offer little value to public safety because the offender does not obtain the firearm.\"\n\nStates that handle these cases are also reluctant to divert troopers or local police away from their regular duties to look into this crime. When the GAO surveyed the 13 states that do their own background checks for all gun purchases, it found that 10 of them don't even investigate these denials, \"citing competing resource demands\" and a lack of laws on the books. The only states that investigated gun purchase denials were Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- and cases in those states had a high bar.\n\n\"We were surprised about the challenges,\" said Gretta Goodwin, who oversaw the study as GAO director of homeland security and justice issues. \"States were pretty clear with us that doing these investigations could be disruptive. They were taking state troopers off the road. They were having to make these kinds of sacrifices or tradeoffs.\"\n\nTo some criminal justice experts, the shortage of law enforcement resources to crack down on illegal attempted purchases of firearms is a symptom of a larger problem: We live in a country with more guns than we can afford to track. The sheer number of guns in civilian hands, they say -- 393 million, by one count -- fuel this problem in a way that will always outpace police efforts.\n\n\"This resource strain is a function of the system we have in place. There's a huge social cost for having a Second Amendment and relatively lax gun laws,\" said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nA stunning internal report\n\nIn an interview, former ATF special agent in charge David Chipman confirmed that he commissioned the 2006 internal report. He had been \"absolutely stunned\" by the results, he said.\n\n\"The assumption was these people weren't a threat,\" Chipman told CNN. He is now a senior policy adviser at the pro-gun control group Giffords.\n\nThe headquarters of ATF in Washington, DC. Internal research there found that a significant percentage of those left unprosecuted for the felony of lying on a gun form will go on to commit a gun crime.\n\nThe 30-page internal study explored how, despite an order from then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to crack down on \"those who attempt to purchase guns illegally,\" ATF agents rarely presented cases to prosecutors -- even if the cases met these attorneys' stringent guidelines. The study also highlighted the surprising importance of these cases by taking a closer look at some of the 82,047 cases ATF sent to its field offices for investigation from late 1998 until early 2006. Out of a random sample of 202 cases, 30 of them showed a \"subsequent arrest history (that) appeared to involve a firearm\" during the seven-year review period. Based on that, the report concluded that an estimated 10%-21% of people denied gun purchases -- whose cases made their way to ATF field offices -- committed \"subsequent crimes (that) involved firearms\" during the span of the study.\n\nIf the decade-old study's findings hold up, it suggests that anywhere from 1,322 to 2,631 of the 12,710 people who attempted to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017, failed a background check, and had their cases sent to ATF field offices, would eventually get a gun and commit a crime. Two criminal policy academics who reviewed the ATF paper at CNN's request said they were confident in the research paper's methodology and conclusions, and they think the rate of subsequent gun crimes by attempted purchasers would likely be the same or higher today.\n\nChipman thinks the problem may have gotten worse. Since 2006, online exchanges that connect buyers and sellers have changed the marketplace, making it easier than ever for a prohibited person to find a private seller and avoid a background check when buying a firearm. Federal law requires licensed gun shops to conduct background checks, but not private sellers.\n\nAnd states have a difficult time cracking down on a burgeoning phenomenon: mail-order gun parts and do-it-yourself \"ghost gun\" kits, like the ones that allowed Zawahri to construct his own firearm in California. Webster, the Johns Hopkins professor, noted that private gun ownership in general has significantly increased, flooding the market with weapons that criminals may obtain through theft or undocumented sales.\n\nSince the 2006 study, ATF has not assessed the threat from people who lie on gun background check forms, the agency told CNN. And the original paper remained unknown to the public, as is typical for such internal briefing papers. Asked why it was not released, ATF spokeswoman April Langwell told CNN: \"The draft report to which you refer is now 12 years old. I do not know why it was not finalized/released ... & obviously the individuals who were working then are long gone.\"\n\nChipman, who commissioned the briefing paper, said that the report was final and not a draft. \"The biggest frustration I ever had working at ATF is that some of this high-level data about what happens after people are denied\" never reaches the public, he said.\n\n\"It really is something the people need to know,\" he said. \"Facts matter. There's science and data. And that data should be out there ... it solidifies what the real challenges are so that policymakers have a shared group of facts.\"\n\nNew interest in lie-and-try; but so far, little change\n\nThe GAO investigator who recently reviewed prosecution of \"lie and try\" cases told CNN she was surprised to learn about the internal ATF statistics on subsequent crimes committed by people who provide false information on gun buying forms. The GAO was not aware of the briefing paper, GAO's Goodwin told CNN. Even without that information, however, the GAO acknowledged that a major crackdown would require more resources for law enforcement.\n\nThe GAO found that ATF agents sometimes simply send denied purchasers a text message or letter to deter future attempts -- and potentially serve as future evidence that the person knew they were prohibited. ATF officials told GAO they prefer text messages over official-looking warning letters because text messages \"are less intimidating to prohibited persons, the texts save time and money, and are more effective in helping retrieve firearms.\"\n\nThe GAO report suggests that ATF review the benefits of using text messages and warning letters \"as an enforcement tool,\" and perhaps consider making this an agency-wide policy. An ATF spokesman said there's no rigid policy at the agency for making contact with those who lie and try. Less serious cases, like those involving someone with a decades-old felony who tried to buy what's considered a turkey-hunting shotgun, result in a simple courtesy phone call to inform a rejected gun buyer why they were denied. More serious cases, like those involving domestic abusers who try to buy a handgun shortly after conviction, might result in a formal warning letter by mail or even a knock on the door.\n\nIn a country that has become increasingly polarized into Second Amendment rights and gun control camps, lie-and-try enforcement could be one area of consensus. The Democratic congressman who commissioned the report, US Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of the Bronx in New York, told CNN of its release: \"This is one rare moment where we can agree on guns.\"\n\n\"The laws we have should be enforced. We don't fund these agencies properly,\" he said. \"The end result is that people are getting guns who shouldn't get guns.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of 10 senators led by US Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in March that would force the FBI to notify local law enforcement whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and fails the background check. The NICS Denial Notification Act would not provide additional funding for local police to investigate gun form lying, but it would put lawbreakers on their radar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Toomey called his bill \"a commonsense, yet critical, step Congress should take to strengthen gun safety laws.\"\n\n\"One thing that both parties agree on when it comes to gun safety is that we should enforce the laws that we already have on the books,\" US Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, a co-sponsor of the bill, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House version of the bill is in a similar stage. A previous version of the bill, as written by US Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, failed to make it through the House in 2017.\n\nThe lobbying power that most fiercely opposes new gun laws, the National Rifle Association, told CNN it does not oppose the bill. As long as 18 years ago, the organization was calling for tougher crackdowns on prohibited possessors who attempt to buy firearms, framing the issue this way: \" prosecution is prevention .\"\n\n\"The National Rifle Association continues to support the prosecution of dangerous people who knowingly attempt to illegally purchase a firearm,\" said Lars Dalseide, an NRA spokesman.\n\nBecause the bill lacks new funding to pay for local officers to actually follow up on the additional criminal data, former ATF agents tell CNN they doubt the bill will be effective. A spokesman for Coons said the senator would be willing to support a funding provision for the bill \"if more resources are required to do the job correctly.\"\n\nIn March, former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo to step up enforcement of lying on gun forms, directing all of the country's US attorneys to \"enhance prosecution\" in each of their districts \"to ensure vigorous and appropriate prosecution of 'lie-and-try' cases.\" The memo still puts \"particular emphasis on cases against violent persons,\" such as those with previous convictions for violent felonies and misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.\n\n\"We are proud to have taken the most aggressive action to step up lie-and-try prosecutions in nearly a decade,\" a DOJ spokesman told CNN. He added that, under Sessions, the department has stepped up gun prosecutions in general, evident because it has \"charged the highest number of federal firearm defendants in history this past year.\" In fiscal year 2018, the federal government charged more than 15,300 people with firearms offenses -- 17% higher than ever before, according to the DOJ.\n\nThe attorney general's directive came as the GAO was ending its review, so the report didn't capture a possible shift on prosecutorial standards. Sessions ordered prosecutors in the nation's 94 judicial districts to meet with ATF and revise local prosecution guidelines \"as necessary.\" These guidelines are important, because they determine whether the feds in each district are willing to pursue charges -- and whether the bar could be higher, say, in Miami than in San Francisco.\n\nWhen asked by CNN, however, ATF could not point to any change in the way its agents approach these types of cases since the directive from Sessions. The agency indicated that it had \"met with all (US attorney's offices and) reviewed the guidelines.\"\n\nEven to find out what those prosecutorial standards are, and how they differ by region, is no easy task. In January, CNN filed a public records request to ATF for copies of the guidance it receives from local prosecutors about which cases to refer. ATF has not yet formally responded, but a spokesman redirected CNN to the Executive Office for the US Attorneys. CNN filed a similar request with that agency in June. It redirected CNN back to ATF.\n\nSome states have begun to recognize what a danger sign it can be for a prohibited person to skirt the law and try to buy a gun. Last year, Washington became the first state that notifies victims of domestic violence when their convicted abuser attempts to purchase a firearm. Gun dealers there must notify a state association of police and sheriffs whenever someone fails a background check, and the state's \"automated protected person notification system\" then passes on the information. Domestic violence groups in other states are taking notice.\n\n\"Too often our system turns a blind eye to how dangerous a case could be,\" said Tara Muir, policy director at the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. A prohibited person's attempt to buy a gun \"has to be one of the most dangerous indicators there is.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Workers scramble to keep a holiday tradition alive after California's wildfires", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/PVqq9LeLMSI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Camp Fire devastated Paradise, California, and the surrounding community, but it's not stopping one popular holiday tradition.\n\nWorkers have been scrambling all week to get the city's ice skating rink ready to open Saturday.\n\nThe city has run the rink every year since 2012, and Paradise Recreation and Park District Manager Dan Efseaff told CNN that it attracts more than 20,000 skaters each season.\n\nEfseaff said his staff was getting ready to open the rink when t he Camp Fire started November 8\n\nThe fire was the deadliest and most destructive in California history.

Democrats continue to push for border security options that they believe work, rather than a wall.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad. It's very bad.\"\n\nBailey's story\n\nBailey was a healthy little girl until October 28, 2014, when she suddenly couldn't move her neck or her right shoulder or leg.\n\nA rehabilitation expert at a children's hospital said Bailey wasn't really paralyzed, according to her mother, Mikell Sheehan.\n\nThe doctor said the paralysis was an emotional reaction to her sister's birth four months earlier. He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teens open up on sex to beat 'toxic' masculinity", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/QLFn9dMX3NQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) On a warm Saturday afternoon, more than a dozen young men and teenage boys sit on plastic chairs in a yard in their neighborhood.\n\nThey gather to talk about women, respect -- and sex.\n\nIt's a meeting that occurs twice a week in Pankop, a small town in Mpumalanga province, in eastern South Africa.\n\nSome of these young men are virgins, and the group's head, Kabelo Chabalala, is at pains to emphasize that it is OK to be one.\n\n\"There's a lot of toxic masculinity,\" Chabalala, 27, told CNN of the stereotypes portrayed around masculine gender roles in his country.\n\nHe believes that some of this is down to many young men in South Africa growing up without good role models.\n\n\"I realized that growing up without a father figure in my life could have influenced me to make some bad decisions,\" Chabalala said. Many of these young boys \"don't have fathers that are present.\"\n\n\"We see quite a lot of femicide [killing of a woman or girl] in South Africa,\" he explained.

This involves having open debates around self-awareness, exploring how the men behave and how they carry themselves. They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ...

That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use.

This is up from 189.4 pounds and 163.8 pounds, respectively, in 1999-2000.\n\nBlack men, Mexican-American women and Asian men and women were the only groups in the report that did not show a significant increase in weight over that period.\n\nBMI, a formula involving height and weight , also increased. In 2015-16, the average BMI was 29.1 for men and 29.6 for women. Both numbers have increased since 1999-2000 when they were 27.8 in men and 28.2 in women.\n\nAmericans' average BMI \"is now almost 30 which is the cutoff for obesity,\" Ogden noted.

It increased until 2003-04, when the average height was 176.4 centimeters (5 feet, 9.4 inches), and then decreased again until 2015-16, when it was 175.4 centimeters (5 feet, 9.1 inches).\n\nThe report uses data from 47,233 Americans over the age of 20, gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2016.\n\nOgden noted that for weight, waist circumference and BMI, the \"biggest increases between 1999-2000 and 2015-2016 were in Mexican American adults.\"\n\nFor Mexican-American women, average body weight did not start changing until the 2009-10 period, and then it jumped from 161.6 pounds to 172 pounds in 2015-16, according to the report.\n\nMichael Long , an assistant professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University, wrote in an email that \"By focusing on changes in average BMI, this study shows that the problem of excess weight gain is impacting everyone, not just the 4 out of 10 adults with obesity.

Then Townsend gave the visitors the lead with a contender for goal of the season, a fabulous volley after Bernardo Silva half-cleared a free-kick.\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola - who had only lost two other league games here since he took charge in the summer of 2016 - sent on club record goalscorer Sergio Aguero after the break.\n\nThe home fans, and everyone else present, anticipated a fightback but Palace quickly scored again - this time from the spot. Townsend headed Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross against the post, Kyle Walker fouled Max Meyer as he tried to clear and Luka Milivojevic sent Ederson the wrong way with his penalty.\n\nCity sent Kevin de Bruyne, so often a hero of last season's procession to the title, into the rain to attempt a rescue mission but this was beyond even him.\n\nThe Belgian did reduce the deficit when his cross looped into the net, and Gabriel Jesus headed another of his deliveries over, but Palace held on for a deserved victory.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Manchester City 2-3 Crystal Palace: We couldn't have done any more - Pep Guardiola\n\nCity lack usual guile\n\nCity were 13 points clear last Christmas on their march to the title but, if they are to successfully defend their title, they are going to have to do it the hard way.\n\nWe are not even at the halfway stage of this campaign so there is plenty of time for Guardiola's side to get back into their groove, and the title race is far from over, but their lack of guile and creativity here will be a concern.\n\nIt was not for the want of trying by Guardiola, who replaced two defenders with attacking players as he attempted to rescue this game in the second half.\n\nBut Aguero and De Bruyne were unable to come up with the inspiration required to break down Palace's massed defensive ranks until the Belgian's mis-hit cross gave his side hope five minutes from time. Ultimately, though, it was not nearly enough.\n\nPalace plan works to perfection\n\nPalace's past two visits to Etihad Stadium had ended in 5-0 defeats, but Eagles boss Roy Hodgson said before the game he would not simply attempt to shut City out, and he was true to his word.\n\nHis side were immaculately organised in their 4-5-1 formation, dangerous on the counter-attack and helped by two outstanding strikes, but the reason Hodgson's plan worked to perfection was the industry of all of his players.\n\nWhenever City had the ball - they had 78% of possession - they were allowed little space once they advanced into the Palace half.\n\nCity's usual precision passing failed to find any gaps and the home side were reduced to firing in hopeful crosses - 30 from open play alone - in a vain bid to open the visitors up.\n\nThere had been murmurs of discontent from the Palace fans following their side's poor form that had seen them slip towards the fringes of the relegation battle in recent weeks.\n\nBut there was nothing but acclaim for Hodgson and his players at the final whistle on Saturday, as they joined their travelling supporters to celebrate a famous victory.\n\nMan of the match - Andros Townsend\n\nYou could hand this accolade to any of the Palace defence or midfield, who put in such a shift to deny City scoring opportunities, but Andros Townsend gets it for his net-buster which will go down as one of the moments of the season, not just as one of the best goals\n\n'We cannot concede penalties like that' - the managers\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \"We started quite decent and created chances. We scored a fantastic goal and after they passed the halfway line they scored.\n\n\"The third goal... we cannot concede the penalty we conceded. We have to try and avoid it. Palace had three shots on target and scored three goals. Football is like this.\n\n\"It's complicated but we fight until the last second.

improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida.\n\nThe procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April.\n\nMore than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.\n\nIt often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties.\n\nThe condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nSpinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London.\n\nIn the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure.\n\nIt is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nKate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nMore than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.\n\nLouise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: \"We're delighted

\"failing the public\" and is calling for taxes on unhealthy food high in sugar and salt.\n\nChief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for everyone from the proceeds.\n\nIn her annual report, she also urged the government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food.\n\nThe food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour.\n\nDame Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier.\n\nThis means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said.\n\nBased on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said\n\nDame Sally said \"industry had not delivered\" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more.\n\n\"Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,\" her report says.\n\nShe hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.\n\nBut she recognised this was \"a dream\".\n\nThe report recommends:\n\nextending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks\n\na ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food\n\nmore ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011\n\ntaxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start\n\nincentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables\n\nAnd it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities.\n\nDame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer.\n\nShe said she would be accused of being \"chief nanny\" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a \"dream\"\n\n\"We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,\" Dame Sally said.\n\n\"It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school.\"\n\nThe report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made.\n\n'Wrong-headed legislation'\n\nA spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry \"fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes\".\n\nKate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade.\n\nBut she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight.\n\n\"Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.\n\n\"It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined.\"\n\nAnd she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour.\n\n\"Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a33.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management services and exercise support.\n\nIt represents a real terms cut of 4.6% since last year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title":

But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP.

They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\n\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\n\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected,\n\n\"There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,\" she said.\n\nProf Stokes-Lampard said: \"There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed.\"\n\nAnd Dr Mahtani said: \"How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them.\n\n\"And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm.\"\n\nAre all practices affected?\n\nNo - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs.\n\n\"All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a domino effect. And then it's phenomenally stressful for the doctors at that practice.\"\n\nIs there anything that will help?\n\nGPs say patients can help - by calling in if they can't make an appointment, so it can be freed up for someone else, and by thinking whether they could get the advice they need somewhere else, such as the chemist's or dentist.\n\nThere are various ideas being tried out across general practice too, experimenting with taking some of the administration away from GPs and bringing in other professions, physiotherapists and social workers, into primary care in addition to the specialist nurses that many people are already familiar with.\n\nTechnology can also help - some practices have online systems where patients can book directly.\n\nBut Dr Mahtani said there was no single solution - because each practice had a different mix of patients and different skills among its staff.\n\nBetter funding was key though. \"If you invest in primary care, you will reduce your costs in secondary care - 90% of first contacts are in primary care,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to embrace general practice.\"\n\nWhat's your experience of booking a routine appointment with your GP or practice nurse?

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Charity Notes Even One Dollar Can Help A Needy Child But You\u2019d Have To Be A Dick To Give That Little", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/charity-notes-even-one-dollar-can-help-a-needy-child-bu-1831264088", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "LONDON\u2014Noting that making a difference would cost less than a single cup of coffee, the Against Malaria Foundation released an advertising campaign Friday stressing that even one dollar could help a needy child, but you\u2019d have to be a complete fucking dick to give that little. \u201cFor just one dollar out of your paycheck, you could help make sure no child has to experience this horrible disease, although what kind of a callous prick would you be to send us one measly buck?\u201d said the commercial\u2019s voiceover, explaining that any contribution was appreciated in this season of giving, but, that you would need to be a real heartless fuck of a Scrooge to look at how fortunate you are this Christmas and how little these children have and decide one-hundred pennies was the most you could possibly spare. \u201cEvery cent counts, of course.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Envoy to Anti-IS Coalition Quits Over Trump\u2019s Syria Move", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-department-says-special-envoy-mcgurk-resigns/4712187.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest over President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a U.S. official said, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security figures.\n\nOnly 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be \u201creckless\u201d to consider IS defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. McGurk decided to speed up his original plan to leave his post in mid-February.\n\nAppointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, McGurk said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.\n\nHis letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a tweet shortly after news of McGurk\u2019s resignation broke, Trump again defended his decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhen I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We\u2019re coming home!\u201d\n\nAlthough the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015.\n\nMcGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis\u2019 resignation, according to the official.\n\nTrump declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts\u2019 assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash and dangerous.\n\nMattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because \u201cyou have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\u201d\n\nTrump defended his decision Saturday to order the troop withdrawal, tweeting, \"Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!\"\n\nThe withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump\u2019s goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.\n\nAmong officials\u2019 key concerns is that a U.S. pullout will leave U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces vulnerable to attacks by Turkey, the Syrian government and remaining IS fighters. The SDF, a Kurdish-led force, is America\u2019s only military partner in Syria\n\nA second official said McGurk on Friday was pushing for the U.S. to allow the SDF to reach out to troops allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government for protection. McGurk argued that America had a moral obligation to help prevent the allied fighters from being slaughtered by Turkey, which considers the SDF an enemy.\n\nMcGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that \u201cit would be reckless if we were just to say, \u2018Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.\u2019 I think anyone who\u2019s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\u201d\n\nA week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.\n\nMcGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.\n\nMcGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nA former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush\u2019s National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.\n\nTaking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.\n\nJim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.\n\nIS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.\n\nBut that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants. Military officials have also made it clear that IS fighters fleeing Euphrates River region have found refuge in other areas of the country, fueling concerns that they could regroup and rise again.\n\nThe SDF said Thursday: \u201cThe war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.\u201d\n\nVOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Cancer the Latest Health Woe for Resilient Justice Ginsburg", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cancer-the-latest-health-woe-for-resilient-justice-ginsburg/4712160.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resting in a New York hospital following surgery to remove two malignant growths in her left lung, the third time the Supreme Court\u2019s oldest justice has been treated for cancer and her second stay in a hospital in two months.\n\nWorries over Ginsburg\u2019s health have been a constant of sorts for nearly 10 years, and for liberals, particularly in the last two. Ginsburg, the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing and known to her fans as the Notorious RBG, has achieved an iconic status rare for Supreme Court justices.\n\nIf she did step down, President Donald Trump would have another opportunity to move a conservative court even more to the right. \u201cWishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!\u201d Trump tweeted after the court\u2019s announcement Friday.\n\nBut Ginsburg has always bounced back before, flaunting her physical and mental fitness.\n\nAfter past health scares, she has resumed the exercise routine popularized in a book written by her personal trainer and captured in a Stephen Colbert video. Weeks after cracking three ribs in a fall at the Supreme Court in November, the 85-year-old Ginsburg was asking questions at high court arguments, speaking at a naturalization ceremony for new citizens and being interviewed at screenings of the new movie about her, \u201cOn the Basis of Sex.\u201d\n\nGinsburg will remain in the hospital for a few days, the court said. She has never missed arguments in more than 25 years as a justice. The court next meets on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to refer to good luck and cancer diagnoses in the same breath, this is the second time for Ginsburg that cancerous growths have been detected at an apparently early stage through unrelated medical tests.\n\nThe nodules on her lung were found during X-rays and other tests Ginsburg had after she fractured ribs in a fall in her Supreme Court office on Nov. 7, the court said. In 2009, routine follow-up screening after Ginsburg\u2019s colorectal cancer 10 years earlier detected a lesion on her pancreas. Doctors operated and removed the growth they\u2019d previously spotted, plus a smaller one they hadn\u2019t seen before. The larger growth was benign, while the smaller one was malignant.\n\nDoctors who are not involved in Ginsburg\u2019s care said she may have gotten lucky again, although they caution it is too soon to know.\n\n\u201cThis is just luck\u201d that the growths were found through those rib X-rays because accidentally discovered lung tumors tend to be early-stage when surgery works best, said Dr. Giuseppe Giaccone, an oncologist at Georgetown University\u2019s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nDr. John Lazar, director of thoracic robotic surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said it\u2019s not uncommon to see slow-growing lung cancers in women in their 80s, and they tend to respond well to surgery and go on to die of something unrelated, he said.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s previous bouts with cancer were so long ago they\u2019re unlikely to be related, Giaccone said.\n\n\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t need anything but the surgery, it is a very good sign,\u201d Lazar said.\n\nBoth doctors said patients typically spend three days or four days in the hospital after this type of operation.\n\nOn Friday, doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York performed a procedure called a pulmonary lobectomy on Ginsburg. The growths they removed were determined to be malignant in an initial pathology evaluation, the court said, citing Ginsburg\u2019s thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie W. Rusch.\n\nBut there was \u201cno evidence of any remaining disease\u201d and scans taken before the surgery showed no cancerous growths elsewhere in her body, the court said. No additional treatment is currently planned, it said.\n\nAmong other health problems, she also broke two ribs in a fall in 2012 and had a stent implanted to open a blocked artery in 2014. She was hospitalized after a bad reaction to medicine in 2009.\n\nAppointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg rebuffed suggestions from some liberals that she should step down in the first two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, when Democrats controlled the Senate and would have been likely to confirm her successor.\n\nShe already has hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to retire."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Reportedly Discussed Firing Fed Chairman Powell", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-reportedly-discussed-firing-fed-chairman-powell/4712128.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump has discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Bloomberg reported Saturday.\n\nCiting four people familiar with the discussions, Bloomberg reported Trump has become more frustrated with Powell after months of stock market losses and the central bank's interest rate hike on Wednesday.\n\nAdvisers reportedly have warned Trump that firing Powell would further roil financial markets, yet they said Trump has discussed the matter many times in the past few days.\n\nThe sources who spoke with Bloomberg on condition of anonymity were not convinced Trump would fire Powell, and were hopeful the president's anger over the situation would subside over the holidays.The White House and the Federal Reserve have declined to comment.\n\nA firing of Powell would come after weeks of heavy losses in the markets.

For centuries, the Zapotec people have created intricate, hand-woven textiles. It is a tradition that Gutierrez and his family are continuing, with what he calls \u201cfunctional works of art,\u201d inspired by the natural world.\n\n\u201cOne of my memories as a child is walking up into the mountains above the hill to collect the plants that my parents needed for making their dyes, almost like a pilgrimage,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey would tell us about the respect that we need to have towards our Mother Earth, as well as where the plants are growing, what colors they give us and the best time to collect them.\"\n\nThese were basic principles in understanding how to work in harmony with Mother Nature, Gutierrez explained.\n\nJourney with the threads\n\nUsing the bounty of Mother Nature gives the family\u2019s handicrafts a warm, soft look and feel. The vibrant earth tones and symbolic designs are representations of their ancient culture.\n\nIn the past, such textiles would be used primarily as blankets, Gutierrez said, but starting in the 1970s, they began to be used mostly for rugs and tapestries. \u201cThese are pieces that could be used as a centerpiece, or wall art, or as a rug,\u201d he said, while holding up a colorful, woven rug.\n\nNative Art market\n\nGutierrez was speaking from his booth at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, which recently hosted a two-day Native Art market. It offered visitors a rare opportunity to purchase traditional and contemporary artwork by some of the finest Native American artists from across the hemisphere.\n\nOther crafts on display at the market included silver and semi-precious jewelry, ceramics, fine apparel, handwoven baskets, traditional beadwork, dolls, paintings and sculptures.\n\nLike Gutierrez, many of the artists shared how they, too, were inspired by nature for their work.\n\nComanche/Blackfeet\n\nTraditional artist Jhane Myers, for example, uses elk teeth and buffalo bone for some of her jewelry.\n\n\u201cEach elk has two ivory teeth, so I do these necklaces, and they have buffalo bone beads,\u201d she said, pointing to a long necklace she was wearing made of the ivory-colored materials. \u201cI try to use all the same items that we used as a traditional Native people 200 years ago,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd just like her Comanche/Blackfeet ancestors, Myers and members of her community try to use every part of the animal. \u201cLike the Buffalo and the elk, we use everything, not just the teeth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also eat the meat and tan the hide.\u201d She creates dresses made from elk hides, and pointed out that there are a multitude of other uses for the animals they harvest.\n\nJemez Pueblo\n\nVisual artist Kathleen Wall breaks clay out of the earth around Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico, where she\u2019s from, to make her signature dolls.\n\nAs she spoke from behind her booth at the art market, she was surrounded by dolls of varying sizes, each with their own serene face and individual paint job.\n\n\"This piece here, she is hand built from the bottom up and I use a coil technique,\u201d she explained while cradling one of her dolls. After the coiling, which means arranging or winding something in a joined sequence of concentric circles or rings, she lets the clay dry, then scrapes and sands it and then uses a kiln for firing, she explained.\n\n\u201cLike so many Pueblo potters working today, I feel that I\u2019m fulfilling my grandmother\u2019s legacy, passing on the knowledge of Pueblo potter.\u201d\n\nWall says she sculpts expressions of joy onto the faces of her Native clay figures, which is a reflection of the beauty of Native culture in and around her life.\n\nCherokee\n\nVivian Cottrell has been making baskets for 46 years, a skill inherited from her Cherokee ancestors.\n\n\u201cThis is part of our culture, our heritage, our history.

And for me it's so important to see my other fellow artists here because you have people from all different types of nations offering different types of art, so it's like a family place; it's almost like coming home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say this is one of the most important institutions that aims to honor the traditional ways of arts, knowledge, wisdom, and promote it,\u201d said Gutierrez. Like many artists, he fears that the time-honored traditions of their ancestors are in danger of disappearing.\n\n\u201cSo I feel like I need to contribute to their preservation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the only way to preserve it is to actually employ these old ways of making the arts, and teaching younger members of the community about our ancient traditions.\"\n\nGutierrez said he is also grateful for institutions like the Smithsonian for celebrating and honoring Native people, and for creating opportunities for them to promote their work.\n\nThe museum, a short distance from the U.S. Capitol, has been holding the annual market since 2006. Hayes Lavis, the museum's cultural program specialist, says his hope is that visitors will take away from the experience of the art market \"a realization of the contributions of native people to the Americas.\"\n\n\u201cThey were here first, they\u2019ve always been here, they\u2019ve gone through a lot of adversity and they are still thriving, strong, creative cultures,\u201d he said.\n\nThe art represented in the market doesn't just reflect the beauty and rich history of Native cultures, but the strength and resilience of the people themselves."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Envoy to Anti-IS Coalition Quits Over Trump\u2019s Syria Move", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-department-says-special-envoy-mcgurk-resigns/4712187.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest over President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a U.S. official said, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security figures.\n\nOnly 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be \u201creckless\u201d to consider IS defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. McGurk decided to speed up his original plan to leave his post in mid-February.\n\nAppointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, McGurk said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.\n\nHis letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a tweet shortly after news of McGurk\u2019s resignation broke, Trump again defended his decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhen I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We\u2019re coming home!\u201d\n\nAlthough the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015.\n\nMcGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis\u2019 resignation, according to the official.\n\nTrump declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts\u2019 assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash and dangerous.\n\nMattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because \u201cyou have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\u201d\n\nTrump defended his decision Saturday to order the troop withdrawal, tweeting, \"Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!\"\n\nThe withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump\u2019s goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.\n\nAmong officials\u2019 key concerns is that a U.S. pullout will leave U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces vulnerable to attacks by Turkey, the Syrian government and remaining IS fighters. The SDF, a Kurdish-led force, is America\u2019s only military partner in Syria\n\nA second official said McGurk on Friday was pushing for the U.S. to allow the SDF to reach out to troops allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government for protection. McGurk argued that America had a moral obligation to help prevent the allied fighters from being slaughtered by Turkey, which considers the SDF an enemy.\n\nMcGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that \u201cit would be reckless if we were just to say, \u2018Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.\u2019 I think anyone who\u2019s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\u201d\n\nA week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.\n\nMcGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.\n\nMcGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nA former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush\u2019s National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.\n\nTaking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.\n\nJim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.\n\nIS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.\n\nBut that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants. Military officials have also made it clear that IS fighters fleeing Euphrates River region have found refuge in other areas of the country, fueling concerns that they could regroup and rise again.\n\nThe SDF said Thursday: \u201cThe war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.\u201d\n\nVOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Reportedly Discussed Firing Fed Chairman Powell", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-reportedly-discussed-firing-fed-chairman-powell/4712128.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump has discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Bloomberg reported Saturday.\n\nCiting four people familiar with the discussions, Bloomberg reported Trump has become more frustrated with Powell after months of stock market losses and the central bank's interest rate hike on Wednesday.\n\nAdvisers reportedly have warned Trump that firing Powell would further roil financial markets, yet they said Trump has discussed the matter many times in the past few days.\n\nThe sources who spoke with Bloomberg on condition of anonymity were not convinced Trump would fire Powell, and were hopeful the president's anger over the situation would subside over the holidays.The White House and the Federal Reserve have declined to comment.\n\nA firing of Powell would come after weeks of heavy losses in the markets.

House members were told they would receive 24 hours\u2019 notice before any vote.\n\nThe impasse blocks money for nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice.\n\nThe disruption affects many government operations and the routines of 800,000 federal employees. Roughly 420,000 workers were deemed essential and will work unpaid just days before Christmas. An additional 380,000 will be furloughed, meaning they will stay home without pay.\n\nFederal employees already were granted an extra day of vacation on Monday, Christmas Eve, thanks to an executive order that Trump signed this past week. The president did not go to Florida on Friday as planned for the holiday.\n\nThose being furloughed include nearly everyone at NASA and 52,000 workers at the Internal Revenue Service. About 8 in 10 employees of the National Park Service were to stay home; many parks were expected to close.\n\nThe Senate passed legislation ensuring that workers will receive back pay. The House seemed sure to follow suit.\n\nSome agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, were already funded and will operate as usual.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service, busy delivering packages for the holiday season, will not be affected because it\u2019s an independent agency. Social Security checks will be mailed, troops will remain on duty and food inspections will continue.\n\nAlso still functioning will be the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard. Transportation Security Administration officers will continue to staff airport checkpoints and air traffic controllers will be on the job.\n\nTrump has savored the prospect of a shutdown over the wall for months. Last week he said he would be \u201cproud\u201d to close down the government, and on Friday said he was \u201ctotally prepared for a very long\u201d closure. Many of Congress\u2019 most conservative Republicans welcomed such a confrontation, but most GOP lawmakers have wanted to avoid one because polling shows the public broadly opposes the wall and a shutdown over it.\n\nInitial Republican reaction to the shutdown was muted. Among the few GOP lawmakers who issued statements as it began were Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who expressed disappointment at the lack of a deal, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. \u201cThis is a complete failure of negotiations and a success for no one,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nThe Democratic leaders, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, said in a statement that Trump \u201cthrew a temper tantrum and convinced House Republicans to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season.\u201d\n\nTrump had made clear last week that he would not blame Democrats for any closure. Now, he and his GOP allies have spent the past few days saying Democrats bear responsibility.\n\nThe president said now was the time for Congress to provide taxpayers\u2019 money for the wall, even though he long had claimed Mexico would pay for it.

But if we don\u2019t do the research, we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019\n\nConcerns over \u201ctheoretical harm\u201d drive decisions to exclude pregnant women from interventions, Krubiner said. But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities. But they also provide opportunities to better prepare for, and respond to, the next epidemic.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Ebola outbreaks in Congo, responders have applied lessons from West Africa\u2019s 2014-16 epidemic to community engagement.

Jam their signals, others suggested.\n\nExperts say it's not that easy.\n\nBritain and the U.S. prohibit drones from being flown too high or too close to airports and other aircraft. In Britain, it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nStill, there is little to stop a drone operator bent on disrupting air traffic, which British officials say was the case with the Gatwick incident that began Wednesday evening.\n\nThe number of close calls between drones and aircraft has increased dramatically in recent years as the popularity of drones has soared. Basic models for amateurs sell for under $100; larger, more sophisticated ones can cost hundreds more.\n\nBritain had 120 reports of close encounters in 2018, up from 93 last year. In 2014, there were six, according to the U.K. Airprox Board, which catalogs air safety incidents.\n\nIn the United States, there were nearly 2,300 drone sightings at airports in the year ending June 30, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Runways have been temporarily closed, but an FAA spokesman said he could not recall drones ever leading to the shutdown of a U.S. airport.\n\nDrone dangers\n\nA drone hit a small charter plane in Canada in 2017; it landed safely. In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones. It wasn't clear what brand was used in the Gatwick incident.\n\nBritish authorities are planning to tighten regulations by requiring drone users to register, which could make it easier to identify the pilot. U.S. law already requires users to register their drones and get certified as pilots.\n\nBut Wagner warned: \"If somebody wants to do something really bad, he will never register.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "DC Sues Facebook Over Cambridge Analytica's Data Use", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/dc-sues-facebook-over-cambridge-analytica-s-data-use/4708039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "The attorney general for Washington, D.C., said Wednesday that the nation's capital had sued Facebook over reports involving Cambridge Analytica's use of data from the social media giant.\n\n\"Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data and how it was used,\" Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. \"Facebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other third-party applications to collect personal data without users' permission.\"\n\nThe lawsuit came as Facebook faced new reports that it shared its users' data without their permission.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign at one point, gained access to personal data from tens of millions of Facebook's users.

Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria, known as John of God, \u201cwas a medium of prestige here in Brazil,\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. His devoted followers believed he had the power to heal through \u201cspiritual surgeries\u201d and felt betrayed and even defensive when women began accusing him of abusing them under the guise of treatment.

In a matter of days, more than 500 women filed complaints against Faria, leading authorities to arrest him Dec. 16 and charge him Dec. 20 with \u201csexual violation through fraud,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nHuffPost Brazil decided to make this the focus of its coverage. \u201cWe have chosen, first of all, to emphasize the importance of women\u2019s denunciations [against Faria],\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. \u201cWe know that specifically in Brazil, cases of sexual violence are underreported for a number of reasons \u2014 among them not only shame and fear, but also the fact that powerful men are involved.\u201d\n\nThe swift investigation into Faria highlights how important it is for survivors to report their abusers and the collective power of women\u2019s voices, Andrea said.\n\n\u201cI think this is the main nuance that this case brings: The voice of women strengthens the denunciations [against Faria] and provides a basis for a solid investigation against a man who, according to them, committed a series of violent acts in moments of fragility as they searched for connection with the divine.\u201d\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nCourtesy of Tila House\n\nEarlier this year, ARTnews Magazine devoted an issue to the status of women in the art world.

Black women have even less of a presence in the art world, representing just 4 percent of artists at leading U.S. fine art institutions, HuffPost U.S. reported. But one artist is aiming to change that. HuffPost U.S. spoke this week with Tiffany LaTrice, the founder of an Atlanta-based arts incubator, co-working and gallery space devoted to empowering black women artists. Tila Studios is already making an impact: It raised enough money this year to send 10 black women artists to Miami\u2019s Art Basel, one of the largest commercial art fairs in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to disrupt the traditional and kind of stale industry that hasn\u2019t really seen a lot of shakeup,\u201d LaTrice said. \u201cSo [we went] down there to kind of shake things up.\u201d\n\nChatiyanon via Getty Images\n\nBoth HuffPost U.S. and HuffPost Canada reported this week on proposals that would make menstrual hygiene products available to more women who can\u2019t afford them.

It is used by Muslims to denote items that fit within various Islamic requirements, such as restrictions against the pork-based gelatin found in some candies. Businesses that want to take advantage of the growing demand for halal foods often get their products verified by halal certification agencies. A similar process exists for businesses catering to Jewish customers who want to know that their food is certified kosher.\n\nHermann J.

The pope addressed the Roman Catholic Church's sexual abuse crisis in his remarks.\n\nThe pope\u2019s message comes at the end of one of the toughest years of his papacy. Francis started off the year by passionately defending a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse of minors, dismissing the testimony of abuse survivors as \u201cslander.\u201d Months later, he admitted he made \u201cgrave errors\u201d in his handling of Chile\u2019s abuse crisis.\n\nLater in the year, the crisis in the U.S. reached a fever pitch after a Pennsylvania grand jury published a devastating report into sexual abuse in the state that identified 301 predator priests and more than 1,000 victims. The report has sparked similar attempts by state prosecutors around the country.\n\nJust this week, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan released a damning report accusing the Catholic Church in Illinois of withholding the names of at least 500 priests accused of abuse.\n\nMadigan\u2019s preliminary report concludes that her state\u2019s Catholic dioceses are incapable of investigating themselves and \u201cwill not resolve the clergy sexual abuse crisis on their own.\u201d\n\nThe pope has also been beset this year by accusations from a Vatican insider that Francis and others in the hierarchy were complicit in covering up abuse carried out by former American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Francis has not directly responded to the claims he was complicit, which are still unsubstantiated.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Francis said February's bishops' summit on sexual abuse will address protecting children, bringing healing to victims and improving training in seminaries.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the pope has called for a bishops\u2019 summit on sexual abuse in February, which will be attended by the heads of about 110 national Catholic bishops\u2019 conferences, the leaders of religious orders and abuse experts, Reuters reports.\n\nOn Friday, Francis said the summit will address how to protect children, bring healing to the victims, and improve training on the issue in seminaries. He vowed to turn \u201cpast mistakes\u201d on handling the crisis into \u201copportunities for eliminating this scourge\u201d in the church and in broader society.\n\nFrancis also thanked journalists for highlighting the voices of Catholic victims. At the same time, he emphasized that the Catholic Church isn\u2019t the only institution dealing with sexual abuse cases.\n\n\u201cIf this grave tragedy has involved some consecrated ministers, we can ask how deeply rooted it may be in our societies and in our families,\u201d Francis said. \u201cConsequently, the church will not be limited to healing her own wounds, but will seek to deal squarely with this evil that causes the slow death of so many persons, on the moral, psychological and human levels.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Francis emphasized in his remarks to the Roman Curia on Friday that the Catholic Church isn't the only institution dealing with sexual abuse cases.\n\nGiven the church\u2019s dismal track record on policing itself in the past, abuse survivors and their advocates were skeptical about Francis\u2019 new comments on the crisis.\n\nAnne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the abuse tracking website Bishop-Accountability.org, told HuffPost she thinks the pope is \u201cindulging in make-believe and misdirection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn commanding child molesters to turn themselves in, Francis is pretending. He\u2019s pretending that sick men suddenly can see the light,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretending the problem lies with perpetrator priests and some ignorant bishops of the past rather than with an ongoing cover-up approved by the Vatican itself.\u201d\n\nShe criticized Francis for bringing up the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cthread-worn\u201d self-defense that children are abused in all sectors of society.

Toni was disabled and didn\u2019t drive, which was a concern, but the couple planned to stay in touch and figured Jim could just drive back if she needed to evacuate.

Yes, we have solar panels and wind farms, but the rate of fossil fuel use is projected to rise through 2040, and 2018 had the highest level of global carbon emission in history.

Chef and restaurant owner Erin Smith founded a group that aims to help women access affordable reproductive care.\n\nBeing a woman in the restaurant industry has its challenges \u2015 from sexual harassment, to unfair compensation to inadequate access to health insurance. Being a woman in the restaurant industry in Texas presents a whole additional set of obstacles.\n\nJust 14 percent of restaurant employees across the country receive health insurance benefits from their employers, meaning many rely on publicly funded resources for health care. But that\u2019s not so simple in Texas: These types of health centers in the state meet only 10 percent of the need, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nTexas is also one of the worst states for reproductive health. In 2011, for example, the state cut its family planning budget by two-thirds, which led to an increase in teen abortions and births. That same year, it also rejected federal funding for a Medicaid women\u2019s health program, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nWomen\u2019s health care became a huge concern for Erin Smith, owner of Feges BBQ in Houston. Her outrage grew when Donald Trump became president. \u201cAt each step in the political process over the past two years, everything\u2019s so uncertain, and we need to take a stand and let people know the threat women are facing in health care, especially in Texas,\u201d Smith told HuffPost.\n\nIn 2017, the chef helped form I\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having, an organization fronted by chefs, bartenders and servers that\u2019s raising money and awareness to combat the assault on women\u2019s health care in Texas. The group\u2019s footprint is small, but it offers resources to women in an area where the need is great.\n\nIHWSH has helped its nearly 200 members, all of whom are women in the restaurant industry, access free gynecological exams. \u201c[Exams] are typically not covered under insurance,\u201d Smith said, adding, \u201ca lot of the women are not provided insurance through employment, and most don\u2019t have insurance on their own.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the group raised and donated more than $210,000 to local organizations that prioritize women\u2019s health, including Planned Parenthood and The Rose, which provides breast cancer detection and treatment services to reduce deaths by the disease.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we become sexually active, we have very few healthcare paths as women. We are either actively preventing pregnancy, not actively preventing pregnancy, actively trying to conceive, or pregnant,\u201d Smith wrote in an essay for Food and Wine. \u201cBecause of this reality, more women are driven away from fields that do not provide easier and more affordable access to healthcare and other valuable resources.\u201d\n\nSmith gained a new level of understanding for her cause in 2018, when she learned she was pregnant. She\u2019s fortunate to be the owner of her restaurant, she said, because it allowed her to come up with a viable maternity leave plan for herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very healthy pregnancy, but that\u2019s not the norm for everybody,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIf there\u2019d been something that went wrong where the doctor put me on bedrest, I really don\u2019t know what we would have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month,\u201d she told HuffPost in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to the doctor all the time now. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s something a lot of restaurants are able and willing to accommodate. The restaurant industry in general is made up of mom-and-pop small businesses. You can\u2019t put all the onus on the employer \u2014 there needs to be some help from the government so small businesses can accommodate.\u201d\n\nFeges BBQ does not provide its employees with an insurance policy, but Smith said that if one of her employees becomes pregnant, she would do everything she could to be supportive, including offering paid leave.\n\n\u201cWe would try to work something out to offer some paid time off but would need to guarantee they\u2019d come back,\u201d she said, adding that she would offer both maternity and paternity leave. \u201cIf any of the guys in our business have a baby, we would want to give them some time off, too, because they\u2019re a critical part of the parenting process.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said that the lack of women\u2019s resources puts them at a severe disadvantage, including in their ability to climb the corporate ladder. Without a proper system in which women can be both parents and professionals, this won\u2019t change, she said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see women in leadership positions in this business or other industries \u2014 unless women make the decision not to have families.

A 7-month-old baby reportedly choked on the beads of a wooden teething bracelet and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risks we\u2019ve observed with these products and want parents to be aware that teething jewelry puts children, including those with special needs, at risk of serious injury and death,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., said in a statement.\n\nThe beads of teething jewelry may be made of silicone, wood, or other materials, including amber. The manufacturers of amber teething necklaces claim that a baby\u2019s body temperature warms the amber, releasing a pain-relieving chemical that can be absorbed through their skin to relieve teething pain.\n\nAnd indeed, that chemical, called succinate or succinic acid, has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits. But the FDA has not tested the necklace manufacturers\u2019 claims for safety or effectiveness.\n\nPetardj via Getty Images Teething rings can pose a severe hazard, according to the FDA.\n\nDr. Jaime Friedman, a San Diego-based pediatrician, praised the FDA for issuing the warning. Friedman says that parents rarely ask for her advice on these teething necklaces before they buy one for their baby, but she frequently sees patients wearing them during appointments.\n\nFriedman makes it a point to counsel caregivers away from using them by bringing up choking and strangulation risks, as well as the unknown effects about the amber itself.\n\n\u201cI have not, as of yet, seen that there\u2019s any evidence of [succinic] acid in the bloodstream,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you do have this acid in the bloodstream, do we know what it\u2019s doing? No, I don\u2019t think we do.\u201d\n\nFriedman, who is an official spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics and affiliated with Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group, said that if parents insist on using the necklaces, she advises them to not let babies wear them unsupervised. That means no jewelry while they sleep, or while sitting in a car seat if an adult can\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s unsolicited advice, but hey, that\u2019s my job right? To protect kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has taken a strong stance against other at-home teething pain remedies, including numbing gels or creams for gums, as well as homeopathic teething tablets that were found to contain belladonna, a poisonous plant that can be dangerous to people.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caregivers give their babies a teething ring that has been chilled in the fridge to numb the pain. However, it warns against freezing teething rings, as frozen rings can damage gums. Another safe option for caregivers would be for them to use a clean finger to gently rub or massage their baby\u2019s gums."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric Hurts The Health Of Latino Families, Even Those Here Legally", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-immigration-health-latino-families_us_5c1938dee4b08db990586083", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "Facing critics who have decried these tactics as cruel and immoral, President Donald Trump continues to trumpet his administration\u2019s immigration policies and has doubled down on calls for a border wall with inflammatory rhetoric that stokes fear and distrust.\n\nThat kind of language, public health experts warn, can be damaging in its own right \u2014 especially among Latinos, regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\u201cWe know that deportations and family separations at the border are incredibly disruptive and traumatic to youth and their families. The detrimental impacts of family separations on child development and family systems are serious and long-lasting,\u201d said Dr. Laura Wray-Lake, a UCLA associate professor who has studied how Latinx teens react to immigration policies under Trump. \u201cWhat we\u2019re also coming to understand is that even for youth and families who are not directly threatened by these deportation or family separation policies, the policy climate is creating a more hostile and unsafe environment.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s enforcement tactics are fomenting fear \u2014 and that fear has consequences for health and well-being.\n\nThe ongoing threat of deportation is a form of psychological violence against the whole community.\n\nOne out of every four children in the U.S. is Latino, according to Dr. R. Gabriela Barajas-Gonzalez, an assistant professor in the department of population health at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine, and \u201cthe vast majority of these children are U.S.-born citizens.\u201d Yet even kids who are documented and legally protected from deportation can feel the emotional burden of an anti-immigrant climate.\n\n\u201cLatinx youth are following immigration politics and they can identify the injustices in what language is being used to describe immigrants and how policies are being applied to immigrants,\u201d said Wray-Lake.\n\n\u201cCurrent discourse about immigrants and immigration tends to be dehumanizing,\u201d said Barajas-Gonzalez. \u201cDehumanization is never healthy.\u201d\n\nCurrent discourse about immigrants and immigration tends to be dehumanizing. Dehumanization is never healthy. Dr. R. Gabriela Barajas-Gonzalez\n\nIn a comprehensive analysis of existing research, published in September, Barajas-Gonzalez and other researchers looked at how anti-immigrant rhetoric, dehumanizing language and aggressive immigration enforcement practices were harming Latino children. They found that those who belonged to mixed-status families, which have at least one citizen or legal immigrant child and at least one undocumented parent, dealt with persistent stress and emotional discomfort.\n\n\u201cMixed-status families may change their daily activities in attempts to protect themselves, consequently becoming more socially isolated,\u201d said Barajas-Gonzalez, who led the report. \u201cFor some children, the stigma associated with being from an immigrant family, experiences with discrimination and increased consciousness of legal status is marked by fear, hyperawareness and hypervigilance.\u201d\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images Sandra Chica holds the hands of her daughters during a rally and press conference in support of husband Pablo Villavicencio, who was detained in early June by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after making a catering delivery to Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn.\n\nChildren with these symptoms \u2015 which can also be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety \u2015 tend to be constantly on guard and tense, Barajas-Gonzalez added. \u201cThis state of arousal can be exhausting and impede children\u2019s ability to focus in school,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Kathleen Roche, an associate professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University, agrees. \u201cCitizen children of immigrant parents face risks to their mental health and school success when their parents suffer from elevated psychological distress,\u201d she added.\n\nFear is preventing Latino families from getting medical care.\n\nRoche was the lead author on a March report by GWU\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health that looked at how immigration news and changes in enforcement tactics impacted Latino parents and their teenage children in the U.S.\n\n\u201cFear and psychological harm triggered by recent immigration events appear to spill over into the lives of legally residing U.S. Latinos,\u201d she said. As a result, people weren\u2019t seeking help to take care of their own health, safety and well-being.\n\nResearchers surveyed 213 Latino \u2015 mostly Central American \u2015 parents of teens in a suburb of a large mid-Atlantic city (the location was not named to protect the identities of the study participants). While some of those parents were undocumented, more than two-thirds were living in the U.S. legally as citizens, permanent residents or under temporary protected status.\n\nSixty-six percent of participants reported being worried \u201cvery often or always\u201d about family members getting separated and nearly 40 percent said they \u201cfrequently avoided getting medical care, help from police, or support from social services.\u201d\n\nFear and psychological harm triggered by recent immigration events appear to spill over into the lives of legally residing U.S. Latinos. Dr. Kathleen Roche\n\nOf the parents surveyed, only those who were U.S. citizens seemed \u201cprotected from the harmful consequences of immigration policy changes,\u201d Roche said.\n\nA University of California survey of health care providers, published in July, supports these findings. In that report, 42 percent of providers said children in immigrant families were increasingly missing scheduled medical appointments and 38 percent said immigrant families were increasingly not scheduling routine prevention or primary care appointments for their kids.\n\nEven unborn babies are being affected.\n\nPolitical rhetoric and policies that target specific immigrant groups could also be contributing to an increase in preterm births (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) among Latinas, according to a study released by Harvard University\u2019s Chan School of Public Health in October.\n\nUsing population information from New York City, researchers found that preterm births among Latinas rose from 7.7 percent before Trump became a presidential nominee to 8.2 percent after his inauguration. Preterm births among Latinas born in Mexico and Central America rose even more during that same period, increasing from 7.3 percent to 8.4 percent.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is that this is affecting not only the mothers but the next generation, because when you\u2019re born premature, it increases the risk of infant death, it increases the risk of infant illness and it increases the risk of different kinds of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, when you get older,\u201d Dr. Nancy Krieger, a professor of social epidemiology and the lead author on the study, previously told HuffPost.\n\nAnother study, published in 2017, examined birth weights in Iowa before and after a 2008 immigration raid in Postville \u2015 one of the largest single-site federal immigration raids in U.S. history. Researchers found that after the raid, babies born to Latina mothers, regardless of immigration status, were at a higher risk of low birth weight compared to the same period a year earlier. Babies born to white mothers did not suffer the same effect.\n\nLanguage matters. Policy matters more.\n\nFear, force and toxic rhetoric are having measurable negative impacts on Latinos living in the U.S. \u2014 and anti-immigrant hostility doesn\u2019t seem likely to decrease any time soon."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "As Shutdown Begins, Lawmakers Grasp for a Way Out", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/us/politics/shutdown-trump-senate.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "Among the options discussed behind closed doors were proposals that would allocate anywhere from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion to border security, none of which could be spent on a wall. But it was not clear that conservatives in the House, who insisted on Thursday on adding the $5.7 billion for the barrier the president has demanded, would back that solution.\n\nLawmakers were exasperated and eager to head home for the Christmas holiday. Some held out hope early Saturday that Democrats would meet the White House halfway on Mr. Trump\u2019s $5 billion demand. Democrats in the Senate have offered, at various points, $1.3 billion or $1.6 billion, while Democrats in the House \u2014 whose views are effectively irrelevant because they remain in the minority for another two weeks \u2014 have insisted that not a single dollar will go to wall spending.\n\n\u201cThis has been the interesting challenge,\u201d Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, told CNN on Saturday morning. \u201cYou have the White House that says $5 billion. You have Nancy Pelosi that says zero, you have Chuck Schumer that says $1.3.\u201d He added, \u201cI think there\u2019s a general agreement now that we need to do border security; now it\u2019s figuring out the amount.\u201d\n\nIn South Texas on Saturday morning, work by border security officials appeared to continue as usual despite the shutdown. A Customs and Border Protection helicopter hovered over the Rio Grande, and Border Patrol pickup trucks kicked up dirt as they drove on unpaved roads, with one bouncing across the flood levee, the same structure where Mr. Trump said he aims to construct a border wall.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to do their job like they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d said Art Del Cueto, an agent in Arizona and vice president of the agency\u2019s labor union. \u201cNothing changes, except they don\u2019t get paid.\u201d\n\nThe effects of the shutdown will spread with time, particularly once the workweek begins. The Smithsonian Institution said it had enough money stored away that its museums, as well as the National Zoo in Washington, could remain open through Jan. 1.\n\nEven agencies that remained open, though, said they may need to curb their operations. The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee, Fla., for example, said it would still issue its usual predictions and alerts, but that it would limit social media posts \u201cto subjects that are directly related to forecasts and warnings.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Reliable Allies Refuse to Defend a President Content With Chaos", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/donald-trump-syria-government-shutdown.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 19:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "As he lost the public support of those once willing to step forward on his behalf, Mr. Trump grew angry over his news coverage and told people close to him that he would be fine without Mr. Mattis. He rebuffed them for even expressing concern.\n\nMr. Trump also privately groused about having to postpone departure plans for his 16-day trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. On Friday, Melania Trump, the first lady, had already made plans to leave town with the couple\u2019s son Barron, according to her spokeswoman. Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, who are also planning to go to Mar-a-Lago, were preparing to stay with Mr. Trump in Washington, an administration official said.\n\nOutside the family, a litany of staffing problems loomed as the shutdown deadline drew nearer. Mr. Trump privately complained that Mr. Mulvaney, who stepped into the vacancy left by John F. Kelly after others turned down the chief of staff position, had given him few options for averting the shutdown.\n\nAs the day drew on, reports surfaced that Mr. Mulvaney, who is set to take over for Mr. Kelly on Jan. 2, had once called Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for a border wall \u201cabsurd and almost childish.\u201d\n\nThe consequences of Mr. Trump\u2019s self-sown chaos reverberated throughout the broader Trump orbit, where some conservatives alarmed by Mr. Mattis\u2019s departure said privately that they were finally fed up with the president and regretted having worked to support him. Other allies agreed with his idea for a path out of the Middle East, just not the chaos with which it was done.\n\nWith whispers abounding through Mr. Trump\u2019s camp, Democrats were far more willing to point out publicly what people close to the president said privately.\n\n\u201cThe institutions of our government lack steady and experienced leadership,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. \u201cWith all of these departures, it\u2019s about to get even more unsteady.

No longer. Americans must defend their friends and stand up to authoritarians in places like Russia and Iran?

It replaces a long, low barrier stretching east. The panels of the new sections lie stacked on the other side of the road like a long freight train frozen in the dust. Harsh and beautiful treeless desert spills out on all sides, indistinguishable in flora or feature from one side of the border to the other.

Genomics, for example, looks at molecules related to the operations of genes; metabolomics at those involved in our metabolisms, and so on.\n\nBut one of the more compelling \u2019omics fields is proteomics, because it focuses on proteins, which are expressed by genes and subsequently jump-start countless other physiological processes throughout our bodies.\n\nProteins are at the heart of our busy interior biology.\n\nBut almost nothing has been known about the proteomics of people who exercise and whether and how they might differ from those of people who rarely move and what it might mean if they do.\n\nSo, for the new study, which was published in November in the Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, set out to look at various people\u2019s proteins.\n\nThey first gathered 31 healthy young men and women, about half of whom exercised regularly, while the rest did not. They also recruited an additional group of 16 healthy middle-aged and older men, half of whom were physically active and half of whom were sedentary."}]
