For everyone else, it's going to be more difficult in a year that could bring a grave political reckoning.\n\nTrump begins 2019 seeking a face-saving win from a partial government shutdown that's doubling as his first clash with the new Democratic House majority. He invited congressional leaders to the White House on Wednesday for talks as the shutdown stretches into a 12th day.\n\nBefore the end of this year, he could be in a fight for his presidency itself, given special counsel Robert Mueller's widening investigation.\n\nMultiple battle fronts\n\nApart from the shutdown and Mueller, the White House is embroiled in multiple feuds and potential crises, some of them set off by the President's talent for dismantling order. Trump's challenging political situation will test his capacity to impose his will at a time when Washington power is divided after two years of blanket GOP control.\n\nAnd it will bring immense peril as Democratic committee chairs in the House send volleys of subpoenas to the White House in a campaign of oversight that will come as an unwelcome novelty for Trump.\n\nTrump got a taste of one new source of opposition in changed Washington when Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah wrote a Washington Post op-ed Tuesday declaring that Trump's conduct over the past two years, and particularly over the last month, \"is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\nBut how the 2012 GOP presidential nominee votes, rather than what he writes, will be the true barometer of his willingness to challenge Trump.\n\nThe first months of the year will involve crucial deadlines in a tariff duel with China t hat could develop into a major trade war -- or offer Trump a significant victory if he can reach a deal that changes Beijing's economic behavior.\n\nA combative New Year's message b y North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offers the promise of a second summit with Trump or a dangerous deterioration of relations with a power that has yet to honor its commitment to denuclearize.\n\nTrump shocked the Pentagon and lost his defense secretary, James Mattis, with a sudden announcement of a pullout from Syria, though he stepped back slightly by giving the military four months to get out of the war-torn country.\n\nThe President's legal liability is growing in the meantime. Every aspect of his political and business life is under investigation, including his 2016 campaign, his transition, his inauguration and his presidency. He was indirectly implicated in directing a campaign finance crime in association with his former lawyer Michael Cohen by prosecutors in New York.\n\nAnother potential political vulnerability could emerge if recent stock market volatility is a harbinger of an economic slowdown.\n\nStill, the economy remains the best argument Trump's team can make for the success of his presidency.\n\n\"Under President Trump 'unemployment rate is matching its low point of the last half-century,' \" the President's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders tweeted on Tuesday, citing a Washington Times article by Stephen Moore, who's a Trump supporter and CNN contributor,\n\n\"...An all-time high 130 million Americans now have a job...Wages are rising...Americans are again the most productive & among the highest-paid workers in the world.\"\n\nUnder President Trump \"unemployment rate is matching its low point of the last half-century...An all-time high 130 million Americans now have a job...Wages are rising...Americans are again the most productive & among the highest-paid workers in the world\" https://t.co/UEAN8TJ8WD \u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) December 31, 2018\n\nThe economy is an oasis of stability as 2019 dawns.\n\nRussia's arrest, for instance, of an American, Paul Whelan, on spying charges over the holiday highlights souring relations with Moscow, which could be further tested by the Kremlin's troop buildup along the border with Ukraine.\n\nIt would also be no surprise if Trump returns to bashing allied leaders he sees as freeloading off the US defense umbrella while courting strongmen around the globe, a trend in his presidency that emerged again on Tuesday, when he sent congratulations to Brazil's new far-right radical President.\n\nAt home, Washington will shortly be consumed by two new confirmation dramas, for Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, and whomever he chooses to succeed Mattis.\n\nThe new Democratic House majority will make it tough for Trump to add to his legislative legacy, with presumptive speaker Nancy Pelosi gearing up for showdowns with the President and the Republican-led Senate over health care, campaign finance and voting rights.\n\nReady for the fight\n\nFacing a year of challenges, Trump is defiant, spoiling for new fights and relishing the opening exchanges of the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe departures of such \"adults in the room\" as Mattis and chief of staff John Kelly have left the President more liberated to follow his gut than at any previous moment of his term.\n\nBy opting to close down parts of the government over his demands for $5 billion in taxpayer cash for a border wall that he had repeatedly said Mexico would pay for, Trump sent a signal about how he would respond to Washington's new reality.\n\nIn time, the shutdown may therefore become just the first in a string of dramas engineered by the President to please his political base.\n\nUltimately, Trump's most loyal supporters could be crucial to his capacity to influence Republican senators, 20 of whom would need to join Democrats to convict him in any Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut the base-appeasing strategy is risky for a President who rarely gets above 45% in opinion polls and who saw his hardline immigration message repudiated in the loss of the House in November.\n\nIn the past, government shutdowns have often ended when one party concludes that its political interests are being harmed among swing voters. Trump, however, is not playing on the same field as Democrats, since his decision not to avoid a shutdown was designed to appeal to key conservative commentators and grassroots supporters.\n\nThat makes it harder for him to compromise in order to end it.\n\nThe President's tactics -- revealed in tweets blasting Democratic leaders as he stayed home alone in the White House over the holidays -- appear to be mystifying even some on his side.\n\n\"It's not a question of who wins or loses; nobody's going to win this kind of game. Nobody wins in a shutdown. We all lose, and we look silly,\" Sen. Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who's the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nTrump, however, seems convinced he is winning the shutdown.\n\n\"Border Security and the Wall 'thing' and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?\" he tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nBorder Security and the Wall \"thing\" and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2019\n\nBut Pelosi sees the chance for some high ground.\n\n\"@realdonaldTrump has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly & quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown,\" the California Democrat wrote Tuesday on Twitter.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump has the Senate, the White House, and the House (for the moment) under Republican control.

She already has experience as speaker in leveraging a House majority to help prepare the groundwork for a Democratic presidency -- in her tussles with President George W. Bush between 2007 and 2008.\n\nThis time around, her task includes keeping a lid on premature impeachment fever, which would help Trump portray Democrats as overreaching in an unreasonable effort to cripple his presidency.\n\nTrump is finding joy in the early combat of the 2020 presidential campaign. It's clear that Democratic contenders must be ready for simultaneous fights -- one with rivals for the nomination and one with Trump.\n\nThe President's relish for battle was evident in his voice during a New Year's Eve interview with Fox News hours after Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts took her first step toward a campaign.\n\nAsked whether Warren thought she could win the Democratic nomination, Trump returned to the demeaning personal attacks that crushed the GOP field in 2016."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Romney: Trump hasn't 'risen to the mantle' of office", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/jSwfFU91AZQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Sen.-elect Mitt Romney said Tuesday in an op-ed published in The Washington Post that President Donald Trump's behavior since taking office \"is evidence that the President has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\n\"It is well known that Donald Trump was not my choice for the Republican presidential nomination.

His leadership of special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan unquestionably saved the lives of thousands of American and allied troops, as well as countless civilians. No general I know has given more in the service of this country.\"\n\nIn his Sunday interview, McChrystal also reacted to James Mattis' resignation from the Trump administration as secretary of defense earlier this month. Mattis wrote in his resignation letter that Trump had the right to have a defense secretary whose views \"better aligned\" with the President's.\n\n\"If we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis, resigns his position walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces, and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, okay, why did he do it?\" McChrystal said. \"We ought to ask what kind of commander in chief he had that Jim Mattis, that the good Marine, felt he had to walk away.\"\n\nMcChrystal led US forces in Afghanistan under President Barack Obama, but resigned in 2010 over comments he and his top officers made in a Rolling Stone article that belittled other administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden.

China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.\n\nTaiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrives for a press conference at the Presidential Palace after the national flag raising ceremony in Taipei on January 1, 2019.\n\nCross-strait tensions\n\nXi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address , in which she called on Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to \"respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\"\n\nWhile she acknowledged the elections were a \"serious test for the current government,\" Tsai said the results \"absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.\"\n\nShe also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's \"attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Xi said China had achieved a \"achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities.\"\n\nLev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.\n\n\"I am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections,\" he said. \"This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'.\"\n\nNachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing \"now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path.\"\n\n\"If the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force,\" he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.\n\nA group of Hong Kong independence supporters display flags during the annual New Year's Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on January 1, 2019.\n\nHong Kong model\n\nThroughout his speech -- and those of other Chinese officials introducing him -- Xi pointed to \"One Country, Two Systems\" as the model for Taiwanese reunification.\n\nThat is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.\n\n\"One Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots ... under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security,\" Xi said.\n\nHow attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election . Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.\n\n\"Xi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely,\" Nachman said.\n\n\"Xi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not.\"\n\n'No promise to renounce force'\n\nWhile Xi's speech was conciliatory, emphasizing the need for \"peaceful reunification\" above all else, he did not rule out military force if Taiwan were to pursue de jure as well as its longtime de facto independence.\n\n\"We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,\" he said.\n\n\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,\" he said, adding that the \"issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable.\"\n\nWhile it does not formally recognize Taiwan, the US maintains strong ties with Taipei, which have been bolstered under US President Donald Trump."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Indian women form 620 km human chain in support of temple equality", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/n0IJ5N11TB8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "New Delhi (CNN) Two women in the southern Indian state of Kerala made history Wednesday, defying religious conservatives to enter the Sabarimala Temple, one of Hinduism's holiest sites.\n\nThe pair, aged 42 and 44, became the first women to access the shrine after the country's Supreme Court overturned a centuries-old ban preventing women aged 10 to 50 from entering the temple in September last year, ruling it to be discriminatory and arguing that women should be able to pray at the place of their choice.\n\nThe two women made the long, uphill trek to the famous golden-roofed temple accompanied by plainclothes police officers, arriving at the site at approximately 3:45 a.m. Wednesday, Kerala police told CNN.\n\nFor months, Kerala has been the scene of angry protests objecting to the court's decision.

His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected,\" Whelan's brother, David Whelan, said in a statement released Tuesday to CNN.\n\nPaul Whelan is director of global security for Michigan-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner , where he has worked a few years, the company said Tuesday.\n\nPaul has been to Russia many times for work and personal business, and he flew to Moscow on December 22 to attend a wedding ceremony for a fellow former Marine and a Russian woman, David Whelan said.\n\nPaul was with the bride and groom at the Kremlin on Friday, acting as a tour guide for wedding guests, his brother said. When Paul didn't arrive at the wedding later that day, the couple filed a missing-person report with Russian authorities, David Whelan said.\n\nThe family learned about Paul's detention Monday morning after media reports emerged, David Whelan said.\n\n\"Knowing that he's not dead, it weirdly really helps,\" David Whelan said. \"When we couldn't get a hold of him initially, we were worried, and we are still worried now, but at least we know he is alive.\"\n\nPaul Whelan was born in Canada to British parents, but lives in Michigan.

I do not believe he speaks Russian, other than enough words to get around town,\" he said.\n\nCharge could bring up to 20 years in prison\n\nThe FSB, Russia's domestic intelligence agency, announced Whelan's arrest on Monday.\n\n\"The investigation department of the Federal Security Service of Russia initiated a criminal case against a US citizen under article 276 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. The investigation is underway,\" the statement continued. Article 276 is espionage.\n\nIf found guilty, Whelan faces 10 to 20 years imprisonment, Russia's state-run news agency TASS reported . Further details about the reasons for or circumstances of his detention weren't immediately released.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs \"formally notified\" the United States of the detention, a US State Department spokesman said Monday.\n\n\"Russia's obligations under the Vienna Convention require them to provide consular access. We have requested this access and expect Russian authorities to provide it. Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time,\" said a statement from the State Department.\n\nArrest comes weeks after Russian Maria Butina's guilty plea\n\nWhelan's arrest came 15 days after alleged Russian spy Maria Butina pleaded guilty in US federal court , as part of a deal with prosecutors, to trying to infiltrate Republican political circles and influence US relations with Russia before and after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nUntil the plea deal, Butina maintained she was innocent and insisted she was a foreign student interested in bettering relations between the US and Russia. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said the Russian government views her as a \"political prisoner\" who did nothing wrong and had been targeted for political motivations.\n\nCNN asked Samantha Vinograd, who served on President Barack Obama's National Security Council from 2009 to 2011, whether Whelan's arrest is a Russian government response to Butina's legal problems in the US.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin certainly likes to take what he calls reciprocal measures, and in this case, ostensibly he would want to have some kind of bargaining chip if he chooses to try to negotiate for Maria Butina's release,\" Vinograd, a CNN national security analyst, told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n\nWhile the move might be retaliatory, the cases aren't equal, Vinograd said.\n\n\"Maria Butina is in the United States (court system) after an independent law enforcement process was undertaken. She'll get a fair trial. She has access to lawyers and she will not be manipulated by a system that's controlled by an autocratic leader,\" she said.\n\n\"Paul Whelan is not going to have the same benefit while he's in Russia. Vladimir Putin controls law enforcement in Russia. He controls the courts, and he controls propaganda. And thereby, we have to be very clear here that Paul Whelan may be brought before the courts on trumped-up charges with completely fabricated evidence and with a verdict already predetermined,\" she said.\n\nTraveled to Russia as a Marine; worked for BorgWarner since 2017\n\nFew details about Whelan's previous travels to Russia and his military record were immediately available. But during one of his military tours in 2006, he used his two weeks' leave to visit the country.\n\n2007 online Marine Corps article says he spent the leave \"experiencing the post-Soviet era of Moscow and St. Petersburg.\" An attached photo shows him standing across the Moscow River from the Kremlin. At the time of publication, he was a staff sergeant assigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nPaul Whelan spent two weeks' military leave in Russia in 2006, according to an article posted on the US Marine Corps website. This photo accompanying the article shows Whelan in front of the Kremlin during that trip.\n\nWhelan has worked for BorgWarner since 2017, company spokeswoman Kathy Graham said. She noted BorgWarner has no facilities in Russia.\n\nGraham said she believes Whelan was on a private trip, taken during the company's annual holiday shutdown, when he was arrested.\n\nBorgWarner has contacted the US government to see if the company can be of any assistance, Graham said.\n\nWhelan travels extensively, his brother said.\n\n\"My understanding is that he was responsible for looking at the physical security of sites for his employer, to make sure that things couldn't be stolen or be broken into, to remove the opportunities for people to have access to things they shouldn't have access to,\" David Whelan told CNN's Poppy Harlow in a phone interview.\n\n\"But it wasn't cybersecurity. It wasn't body-guard type of security.

But despite Trump's declarations that he's prepared to play hardball with the Democratic investigators, there's a new crew of Democrats in Washington -- rising from the party's return to the majority in the House of Representatives -- who have subpoena power and are prepared to use it.\n\n\"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nJerry Nadler\n\nTrump's history with Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York dates to the 1980s, when they battled over Manhattan real estate while Nadler was in the New York State Assembly before he was elected to Congress. In his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump called Nadler \"one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.\"\n\n\"This guy wanted to put a railroad yard on the same property where I wanted to build a park and create the best middle-income housing in New York,\" Trump wrote in his book.\n\nNow Nadler is set to lead the Judiciary Committee, which would put him i n charge of any Democratic impeachment effort. His committee will also be in charge of handling a report from special counsel Robert Mueller and any fights that may arise about making it public.\n\nNadler's committee also has jurisdiction over Trump's signature issue: immigration, an area Nadler is poised to conduct rigorous oversight on -- from family separation to changes to asylum laws -- in the new Congress.\n\nNadler has said it's too soon to talk impeachment , even though there's a sizable chunk of Democratic advocates -- not to mention some House lawmakers -- who already want to move forward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nadler: Impeachable offense doesn't mean impeachment Replay More Videos ...

Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, answers questions following a committee meeting at the US in February in Washington. Schiff is expected to chair the House Intelligence Committee starting in January. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAdam Schiff\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is no stranger to Trump's Twitter tongue lashings . As the top Democrat on the Republican-led House Russia investigation in 2017 and 2018, Schiff was a constant television presence breaking down the newest revelations about Russia and Trump's team.\n\nThe President has used multiple nicknames on Twitter for the California Democrat -- Sleazy Adam Schiff, Liddle' Adam Schiff and most recently \"little Adam Schitt\" -- a sign of his prominence among Trump's Democratic critics.\n\nSchiff has accused Republicans of failing to investigate the ties between Trump's team and Russia, and he's promised to restart his committee's Russia investigation in several areas.\n\nAmong them: Schiff wants to investigate questions about Russian money laundering, to learn who Donald Trump Jr. was calling as he set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and to interview officials the committee has yet to speak to, like Michael Flynn.\n\nSchiff is a soft-spoken lawmaker, but he's shown a willingness provide headline-grabbing quotes.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first President in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time,\" Schiff said earlier this month on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal criticizes the Republican tax plan during at the US Capitol in November 2017 in Washington, DC. Neal will chair the House Ways and Means Committee in January. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRichard Neal\n\nIn the new Congress it will be Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a deal-focused Democrat, who will have the job of asking for Trump's tax returns . While modern presidential nominees have publicly released their returns, Trump has defied the norm, which Democrats argue must be remedied.\n\nUnder IRS rules, there are only three people on Capitol Hill who can ask the Treasury Department for the President's tax returns: the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal is the only Democrat.\n\nWhile Neal has said he wants to ensure that requesting the returns doesn't distract from his committee's work on infrastructure, health care and oversight of the GOP's tax bill, a source close to the process told CNN that Neal has largely given up hope that Trump will turn over his tax returns willingly, given comments from the President's allies. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN that the President would be prepared to fight in court over any formal request.\n\nThe source familiar with the process told CNN that Neal is prepared to ask the Treasury Department for the returns in the new year. When exactly he would do it is still under discussion.\n\nTrump's tax returns aren't of interest just to Neal, however. Other incoming committee chairs have said the information within the returns could advance their own oversight.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what ... has been the sources of income for this President,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the expected chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nCummings continued, \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia, we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\"\n\nElijah Cummings\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the minority, Cummings has perhaps the broadest authority to investigate the Trump administration of any Democrat on Capitol Hill. Cummings -- even with his deep and focused voice -- is reserved, but strategic about the plans for his committee.\n\nA foil to Republican chairs like Rep. Darrell Issa of California, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, Cummings has argued he plans to be in search of answers, not headlines -- although with his gavel, it's unlikely he will be able to avoid them.\n\nCummings has laid out a very clear path for his committee. Earlier this month, he re-sent 51 letters he'd sent while in the minority, asking the administration to comply by January 11. The letters ranged from questions about Cabinet secretary travel to immigration to security clearances to hurricane recovery efforts by the administration. But Cummings has also warned that he doesn't want his committee to only zero in on Trump's perceived failings.\n\n\"I believe that what we do in this Congress over the next year or so will have impact for the next 50 to 100 years,\" Cummings said. \"We're going to cautiously go about with subpoenas. ... There would have to be something that has a compelling interest to the citizens of the United States, and would have to be something that comes under our jurisdiction. So there's certain criteria that has to be met. I do not expect to be issuing subpoenas -- even the 64 that we've asked for because there are so many things that are backed up. And we'll never get a chance to do everything.\"\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, looks on before speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC in January. Waters will chair the House Financial Services Committee in January.\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nRep. Maxine Waters of California was pushing for impeachment back in 2017 , and she's been among the most vocal and well-known Democrats to do so. Now she'll run the Financial Services Committee, which will give her an avenue to probe the finances of Trump and the Trump Organization.\n\nThat's also made her a target for the President, who went after Waters during the 2018 campaign in tweets and at campaign rallies as a way to fire up his base. He's also attacked Waters as a \"low IQ person,\" which she has said is a racist attack.\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\" Trump tweeted in June. \"She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nWaters has made controversial statements of her own, including her call for supporters to publicly harass members of the administration in response to Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to family separations at the border.\n\nWhile in the minority, Waters pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, a lender to Trump that was separately implicated in a Russian money laundering operation in 2017. She's also pushed the Treasury Department to divulge financial ties between Russia and the Trump family.\n\nThe jurisdiction of Waters' committee makes it likely she'll clash with Trump in a way that particularly hits home for him: his finances."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump on Syria withdrawal: 'Just doing what I said I was going to do'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/3sEu4uJRMDQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, saying he is \"just doing what I said I was going to do\" during his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's comments come a day after Republican Sen.

About four months ago, desperate to be near relatives and longing for small-town life again, they moved to Indiana.\n\nThey picked a home on about 2 acres of land, down rural country roads and tucked between cornfields.

He used a breathing machine to keep him alive and other equipment was hooked up to him to monitor his vitals.\n\nAnias faced major setbacks over the past year. He stopped rolling. He stopped playing with toys. He stopped lifting his head because so much fluid had built around his brain it weighed him down.\n\n\"It was horrific for me to watch,\" Nicole says. Anias had not \"just stopped development, but regressed in development.\"\n\nHe also developed eczema so bad, his mother says, his legs and ankles were like \"raw meat.\" He started having seizures so severe that he'd turn blue up to 15 times a day.\n\n\"I thought I was losing him forever, and I was devastated,\" Nicole said.\n\nBut he recently had his tonsils and adenoids removed, allowing him to breathe on his own and freeing him from the array of medical equipment that was hooked up to him. Since then, the parents have seen a vast improvement. He's begun lifting his head and using his hands and feet in ways he couldn't before -- a spark of hope after a year of heartache.\n\nOn the fridge, the family displays a hand-splattered painting by Anias, titled by his parents. \"Painted this with the right hand that I'm not supposed to be able to use,\" it says.\n\n\"Anias had like Mount Everest medically,\" Nicole said. \"That's what I've started to appreciate is, he climbed his medical mountain.\"\n\nChristian said, \"He's making progress. It's just slow. But it's there, every day.\"\n\n'You just want him to fly'\n\nWhen CNN last visited, the boys were closer in their progress, considering that the surgery had set them back to infancy in many ways. They had to learn how to sit up, crawl and do the other things every baby learns. Anias was a few months behind Jadon developmentally, but it seemed he was on track to catch up. He was able to roll and clap his hands.\n\nAnias lost most of his function over the last year, but his parents say they've begun to see major progress in the past few weeks.\n\n\"What was hard was to see that he was on the same path as Jadon, and then something happened -- lots of things happened -- to pull him out of that race for a minute,\" Nicole said. \"I feel like I'm constantly fighting for the Anias I know.\"\n\nAs a mom, she says, \"you just want him to fly, and he's still stuck on the ground. That was really difficult, but we just had this ray of hope, like in the last month.\n\n\"That's lifts us both,\" she said, \"and we're ready to help him take off.\n\n\"He's the most medically stable he's ever been. He's getting stronger every day,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see a huge change in him over this next year.\"\n\nShe's determined to see Anias become the boy she believes he can be. She tells him things like \"someday, you're going to sit up. Someday, you're going to walk to me.\" He often smiles at her encouraging words.\n\nBoth parents say they are focused in the moment, simply trying to enjoy their boys and relishing their growth.\n\nNicole says she will never stop advocating and fighting for her boys.\n\n\"The boys, they may not be perfectly normal little boys like you and me,\" Christian said. \"But that doesn't mean they can't have a great life.\"\n\nHe says he and his wife used to worry about things like whether the boys' hair would grow back enough to cover the scars on their heads from the various surgeries. But now, they now intentionally cut their hair short: \"They earned those scars. You know, they can be proud of them.\"\n\nAt the family table, Nicole recounts a story of Jadon spilling a drink at lunch and how he put her at ease, saying, \"Mommy, it's just an accident.\" She says he then looked at her and said, \"I am smart.\" She laughed and told him, \"You are smart.\" Nicole was still laughing when Jadon added, \"I am funny.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs she tells this story, Jadon looks at her attentively.

Equatorial Guinea followed with 53.7% and then Lithuania with 53.2%.\n\nNo other countries had more than half of teens in that age group report heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days.\n\nCountries where no 15- to 19-year-olds reported heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days were Mauritania, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"Europe usually is really high, both for the adult population and for 15- to 19-year-olds,\" Rekve said. More than one-fifth of the European population 15 and older has reported heavy episodic drinking at least once a week, according to WHO.\n\nHe added, however, that many European countries have recently seen a drop in alcohol use that mirrors the number of adolescents abstaining from drinking altogether.\n\nOne study, published in the journal BMC Public Health in October, found that 29% of 16- to 24-year-olds in England were non-drinkers in 2015, up from 18% in 2005.\n\nWHO report published in September found that, across 15 European countries and regions, more than 1 in 5 15-year-old girls reported weekly drinking in 2002, with the highest prevalence in England, Scotland, Malta and Denmark. But by 2014, only Malta had a prevalence greater than 20%.\n\nAmong 15-year-old boys, more than 1 in 5 reported weekly drinking across 24 European countries and regions, with the highest prevalence in Malta, Denmark, England, and Wales. But by 2014, only nine countries and regions had a prevalence greater than 20%, with the highest prevalence in Croatia, Malta, and Italy, according to the report.\n\nIn the United States, rates of binge drinking among teenagers also have been on the decline.\n\nThose percentages were down from 2013, when it was reported by 10.2%, 25.7% and 39.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the report.\n\nOverall, the percentage of teenagers in America who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases,\" she said\n\nHow heavy drinking can affect young people's health\n\nStudies have varied, but some researchers say no amount of alcohol is good for your health, and binge drinking can damage the body and brain, especially in a young person. Evidence suggests that heavy exposure to alcohol can be tied to brain impairment and cognitive deficits , including memory problems.\n\nJUST WATCHED How alcohol affects your health Replay More Videos ...

That means that there might be a lot of changes in the future that we need to be aware of,\" Rekve said, referencing how in 2016, 57% of men and women worldwide reported abstaining from drinking alcohol in the past 12 months.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn September, WHO launched an initiative called SAFER in an effort to help governments around the world reduce the harmful impacts of excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nThe initiative features five strategies : enacting and enforcing policies related to alcohol, advancing and enforcing measures to reduce drunken driving, facilitating access to interventions or treatment for alcohol problems, enforcing restrictions around alcohol advertising and considering alcohol taxation and pricing policies."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "American doctor being monitored after possible exposure to Ebola", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/WwbbbIFHnsc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An American was possibly exposed to Ebola while recently providing medical assistance in Congo, according to a release from the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n\nThe person, who has not been identified, is headed to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha for monitoring, the release states, adding the Nebraska Medical Center is home to one of the nation's few dedicated biocontainment units.\n\n\"This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,\" said Ted Cieslak, infectious diseases specialist with Nebraska Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health. \"Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Medicine/UNMC team is among the most qualified in the world to deal with them.\"\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo is going through one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history.

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Rail fares rise by 3.1% in England and Wales", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46731749", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nRail fares have increased by an average of 3.1% in England and Wales - and almost 3% in Scotland - despite a raft of issues on the network in 2018.\n\nThe rail industry says 98p of every pound spent on a ticket is invested back into the network.\n\nBut Wednesday's price hike was called \"yet another kick in the wallet\" by campaign group Railfuture.\n\nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government had made a \"record investment\" in rail.\n\nHe also announced that a new railcard extending child fares to 16 and 17-year-olds will be available ahead of the new academic year in September.\n\nA discount railcard for 26 to 30-year-olds will go on sale from 12:00 GMT.\n\nFares in London will stay the same after a decision by Mayor Sadiq Khan to freeze Transport for London prices.\n\nProtests against rises elsewhere are expected outside stations across the country from rail unions, politicians and campaigners.\n\nThe rise in England and Wales - the highest since January 2013 - will see the price of some annual season tickets go up by more than \u00a3100.\n\nAnalysis from the Labour Party of more than 180 routes claimed that since the Conservatives came into power in 2010, the average commuter is paying \u00a3786 more for their annual season ticket.\n\nThe increases come despite one in seven trains being delayed by at least five minutes in the past 12 months - the network's worst performance since September 2005, according to the Press Association.\n\nChaos caused by new timetables from Northern and Govia Thameslink added to problems of extreme weather, strikes and signal failures hitting routes across the country.\n\nShadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the latest increases were \"an affront to everyone who has had to endure years of chaos on Britain's railways\".\n\nAround 45% of fares are regulated by government, and capped at July's retail price index inflation figure - 3.2%.\n\nOther increases are decided by the train companies.\n\nThe government has said that fares could rise in line with a lower index of inflation if unions agree that rail workers' wages also increase at a lower rate.\n\nTransport secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC: \"I don't think it's right and proper that you see pay rises at 3.5% or more on parts of the rail network that are the biggest factor behind the fare increases.\"\n\nHe apologised for \"tough moments\" on the rail network in 2018 but said new trains being introduced in London, Birmingham and the north of England showed the impact of \"massive investment\" by the government and private sector.\n\n'Value for money?'\n\nThe UK's railways are predominantly funded by customers' fares: last year's figures from the Office of Rail and Road show they yield \u00a39.7bn, while the government provides \u00a36.4bn - excluding loans from Network Rail.\n\nHowever, almost a third of the government funding was given specifically to the HS2 high-speed rail project.\n\nRobert Nisbet, regional director of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said that 11 of the 17 railway companies would be introducing new rolling stock this year.\n\nHe said: \"What we're seeing on the railway at the moment is a record level of investment, more money being ploughed into the railways than at any time since the Victorian era.

For children aged seven to 10 this rises to six cubes (24g) and up to seven cubes (30g) for those aged 11 and over.\n\nHowever, UK children are consuming around 13 cubes or 52g of sugar a day, says PHE, based on results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey.\n\nHalf of the sugar in children's diets comes from sugary drinks, sweets, biscuits, cakes, puddings, sugary breakfast cereals and higher-sugar yoghurts and puddings.\n\nHow can you reduce your child's sugar intake?\n\nImage copyright Public Health England\n\nParents can try swapping:\n\nA higher-sugar yoghurt (e.g. split-pot) for a lower sugar one, to halve sugar intake from six cubes of sugar to three cubes\n\nA sugary juice drink for a no-added sugar juice drink, to cut back from two cubes to half a cube\n\nA higher-sugar breakfast cereal (e.g. a frosted or chocolate cereal) for a lower sugar cereal, to cut back from three cubes to half a cube per bowl\n\nMaking such swaps every day could remove around 2,500 sugar cubes per year from a child's diet, but swapping chocolate, puddings, sweets, cakes and pastries for healthier options such as malt loaf, sugar-free jellies, lower-sugar custards and rice puddings would reduce their intake even more, according to the Change4Life campaign website.\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: \"Children are consuming too much sugar, but parents can take action now to prevent this building up over the years.\"\n\nPHE is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the foods children consume most by 2020.\n\nIn May 2018, PHE published progress against the first-year sugar reduction ambition of 5%, which showed an average 2% reduction in sugar across categories for retailers and manufacturers.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Dr Tedstone said PHE would produce more data later this year on whether the industry is meeting that target.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of introducing a pudding tax, she said: \"If we see less progress, there would be a case for fiscal measures.\"\n\nChief Operating Officer of the Food and Drink Federation, Tim Rycroft agreed that government should wait until the data came out before making a decision, adding that the number of lower sugar products on the shelves has risen in recent years.\n\nHe also said he was \"disappointed\" PHE was focusing on sugar intake rather than the amount of calories in people's diet as a whole.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhile breakfast cereals and yoghurts and fromage frais were among the categories meeting or exceeding the 5% ambition, some products in these categories are still high in sugar.\n\nConsumers should check the labels on packaging to judge if products are high or low in sugar.\n\nThe main sources of sugar in children's diets are:\n\nSugary soft drinks (including squashes, juice drinks, energy drinks, cola and other fizzy drinks) - 10%\n\nBuns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies - 10%\n\nSugars, including table sugar, preserves and sweet spreads - 9%\n\nBiscuits - 9%\n\nBreakfast cereals - 8%\n\nChocolate confectionery - 7%\n\nSugar confectionery - 7%\n\nYoghurt, fromage frais and other dairy desserts - 6%\n\nIce cream - 5%\n\nPuddings - 4%\n\nDoes your child exceed the recommended daily maximum for their age?

For children aged seven to 10 this rises to six cubes (24g) and up to seven cubes (30g) for those aged 11 and over.\n\nHowever, UK children are consuming around 13 cubes or 52g of sugar a day, says PHE, based on results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey.\n\nHalf of the sugar in children's diets comes from sugary drinks, sweets, biscuits, cakes, puddings, sugary breakfast cereals and higher-sugar yoghurts and puddings.\n\nHow can you reduce your child's sugar intake?\n\nImage copyright Public Health England\n\nParents can try swapping:\n\nA higher-sugar yoghurt (e.g. split-pot) for a lower sugar one, to halve sugar intake from six cubes of sugar to three cubes\n\nA sugary juice drink for a no-added sugar juice drink, to cut back from two cubes to half a cube\n\nA higher-sugar breakfast cereal (e.g. a frosted or chocolate cereal) for a lower sugar cereal, to cut back from three cubes to half a cube per bowl\n\nMaking such swaps every day could remove around 2,500 sugar cubes per year from a child's diet, but swapping chocolate, puddings, sweets, cakes and pastries for healthier options such as malt loaf, sugar-free jellies, lower-sugar custards and rice puddings would reduce their intake even more, according to the Change4Life campaign website.\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: \"Children are consuming too much sugar, but parents can take action now to prevent this building up over the years.\"\n\nPHE is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the foods children consume most by 2020.\n\nIn May 2018, PHE published progress against the first-year sugar reduction ambition of 5%, which showed an average 2% reduction in sugar across categories for retailers and manufacturers.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Dr Tedstone said PHE would produce more data later this year on whether the industry is meeting that target.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of introducing a pudding tax, she said: \"If we see less progress, there would be a case for fiscal measures.\"\n\nChief Operating Officer of the Food and Drink Federation, Tim Rycroft agreed that government should wait until the data came out before making a decision, adding that the number of lower sugar products on the shelves has risen in recent years.\n\nHe also said he was \"disappointed\" PHE was focusing on sugar intake rather than the amount of calories in people's diet as a whole.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhile breakfast cereals and yoghurts and fromage frais were among the categories meeting or exceeding the 5% ambition, some products in these categories are still high in sugar.\n\nConsumers should check the labels on packaging to judge if products are high or low in sugar.\n\nThe main sources of sugar in children's diets are:\n\nSugary soft drinks (including squashes, juice drinks, energy drinks, cola and other fizzy drinks) - 10%\n\nBuns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies - 10%\n\nSugars, including table sugar, preserves and sweet spreads - 9%\n\nBiscuits - 9%\n\nBreakfast cereals - 8%\n\nChocolate confectionery - 7%\n\nSugar confectionery - 7%\n\nYoghurt, fromage frais and other dairy desserts - 6%\n\nIce cream - 5%\n\nPuddings - 4%\n\nDoes your child exceed the recommended daily maximum for their age?

Parked up in the dunes behind it are police vans full of officers monitoring the city and coast.\n\nIt is here the refugees try to sneak through, boarding small boats in the dead of night.\n\nMostly men from Iran, Afghanistan and Eritrea and elsewhere, they live in small, squalid encampments. Having trekked all the way from their home countries, the few hundred refugees here are determined to reach the UK in any way possible.\n\nMohamed from Iran, told me he had tried twice in the past week, setting off in a tiny boat with 10 other men who had all paid smugglers to help them. He is trying to reach the UK because his wife and children are already there.\n\nOn their first attempt they ran out of fuel. The second time they got close to the English coast and phoned 999, seeking assistance from UK coastguards, but he said a French vessel turned up instead and they were returned to France.\n\nThe reason refugees are increasingly trying the sea crossing, we were told, is that heightened security around French ports and the Channel tunnel has made it almost impossible to stow away on lorries and trains.\n\nIt is in desperation that people are turning to boats instead.\n\nMr Javid, who returned from a family holiday in South Africa after coming under pressure to act, earlier agreed an \"enhanced action plan\" with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to be put in place in the coming week.\n\nIt includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokeswoman said Theresa May supported the home secretary's work to tackle the \"deeply concerning rise\" in migrants crossing the Channel on small boats.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Two more cutters will be deployed in the Channel\n\nDover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was important illegal migrants were not allowed to stay in the UK.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"What we need to see now is this Dover patrol work hand in glove with the French authorities in a new Channel compact, so that anyone found in the English Channel in one of these unseaworthy craft can be helped carefully and safely back to the French coast - so that they know there is no chance of getting into Britain.\"\n\nBut Ben Bano, from the Seeking Sanctuary migrant support group, warned migrants should not be demonised.\n\nHe said: \"We have to hold on to the fact that people, however desperate they are, are our brothers and sisters in humanity, and that is what we need to keep reminding people about.

But what I've been discovering recently has shaken me to the core.\n\nI can barely look a Babybel in the face. A half-eaten halloumi squeaklessly lies yellowing in the fridge. My cheese dreams are shattering.\n\nFor, after a lifetime of unfettered devotion, could it possibly be that cheese is more foe than friend? That I am addicted to something that is not so good for my body? That cheese should be toast?\n\nThese are questions that began surfacing a couple of months ago when I began making an episode for my new podcast for the BBC, All Hail Kale, looking into whether dairy was scary.\n\nFor some time, I'd increasingly been questioning the logic of adults drinking milk.\n\nWhile milk and dairy products, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein and calcium and can form part of a healthy, balanced diet, as Dr Michael Greger, from NutritionFacts.org, put it to me: \"There's no animal on the planet that drinks milk after weaning - and then to drink milk of another species even doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nHe then reeled off a series of studies showing the life-shortening potential of drinking this \"hormonal stew\".\n\nI'd always blithely assumed cheese was a more mature - perhaps benign or even more beneficial - form of dairy. It fitted a mental picture of spritely, long-living Greeks and Italians liberally sprinkling around feta and pecorino; yet in reality, only a low to moderate amount of cheese figures in the hallowed Mediterranean Diet.\n\nI'd also unilaterally decided that a childhood diagnosis of lactose-intolerance should in no way impede me from mainlining paneer when in India or, when skiing, spending more time forking bread into fondue than bothering with the slopes.\n\nDe-cheese?\n\nPerhaps this sense of denial-cum-delusion stems from an actual addiction. One US doctor controversially (and not supported by any of the professors I spoke to) refers to cheese as \"dairy crack\" - for apparently containing addictive, opiate-like chemicals - and even suggests a three-step programme to de-cheese.\n\nStep One: know why you want to break away.\n\nWell, I don't know that I do want to break away.\n\nBut in the journalistic pursuit of seeing whether cheese is a less scary form of dairy than milk, I took my head out of the sand (under which a special Turkish cheese is apparently fermented) and contacted three heavy-hitters in nutrition. They all agreed the milk secretion of another species is a strange thing for us to have latched onto - and adult humans have no need to drink it. But could a cheese consensus be reached?\n\nDr Michael Greger took a hard line: cheese, with its combination of sodium and concentrated butterfat, should not be part of our daily diets. \"Make it for a special occasion rather than the day-to-day.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDr Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health - took a more semi-hard view of cheese. \"It does not seem to have the same growth-promoting effects as milk does. Have your Brie in moderation and enjoy it.\" He said we should have only one portion of dairy a day.\n\nOver at Cornell University, its Nutrition professor David Levitsky took a distinctly softer stance on the perils of dairy - and confessed to having a small cheese plate before dinner every night. \"I enjoy it, but I don't eat masses of cheese.\"\n\nThe consensus, of sorts, was that cheese should certainly not be at the high end of the spectrum.\n\nIn the spirit of de-ostriching, I then went to see a GP, Dr Enam Abood from the Harley Street Health Centre to get my lactose intolerance retested 30 years on.\n\nShe confirmed that not only was the intolerance still in force but by ignoring it I might have inflamed my gut.\n\nAccording to Dr Abood, my ropey gut means I'm probably not absorbing vitamins and minerals, which isn't great for my immune system, energy levels, and even maybe my mood.\n\nThe damage is most likely the result of me overdoing dairy for years.\n\nDr Abood recommended that if I consume cheese, I should pop a lactase pill - giving me the enzyme I, and many people like me, lack to be able to digest dairy properly.\n\nThe one silver (gut) lining from my medical travels was an intestinal expert telling me that a nice piece of bacteria-rich, non-processed, unpasteurised cheese will go down a treat with the gut microbiome.\n\nHaving also been making an All Hail Kale episode on the crucial role of the gut to your moods, this seemed like an excellent rationale to keep cheese on the table.\n\nI never got as far as Step Two: think about what you can do to change the recipes you have already. Step Three - think about the non-dairy cheeses - seemed too much to even consider stomaching.\n\nInstead, I think about how bewildering it is to get definitive answers around nutrition. I think I should remember to carry around lactase enzyme pills. And I think my gut would want me to have a little slice of Roquefort\u2026 tomorrow.\n\nDownload BBC Sounds to listen to All Hail Kale."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Minority take up 'life-saving' free health check", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46701195", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:52", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Monitoring blood pressure is part of the free health check\n\nFewer than half of people eligible for a NHS health check in England have taken up the offer, despite it being free to everyone over 40.\n\nThe routine check can pick up heart problems early and help to prevent dementia, plus highlight the need to stop smoking, NHS England said.\n\nThe check-up takes 20 minutes and is carried out by a GP or nurse.\n\nIt involves tests on blood pressure, weight and height, and is offered every five years up to the age of 74.\n\nAround 7.15 million people have had a free health check since 2013, yet 15 million are eligible, NHS stats show.\n\nNHS England said identifying people with an irregular heartbeat or high blood pressure and giving them treatment would help to prevent dangerous blood clots which could lead to strokes.\n\nAnd if more people went for their health check, the number of people having a stroke or other heart problems would reduce, potentially preventing thousands of cases of vascular dementia.\n\nWho can have an NHS health check?\n\nAnyone between the age of 40 and 74 who is generally healthy and doesn't already have any diseases.\n\nYou should automatically get an invitation through your GP surgery or local authority every five years.\n\nAfter the age of 74 you can request a health check-up from your GP or nurse.\n\nWhat problems can they spot?\n\nBy checking blood pressure, family history, lifestyle, height and weight, it is possible to give an idea of your risk of getting heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearch shows that people with a history of heart diseases are at least twice as likely to develop vascular dementia.\n\nYou will receive personalised advice on how to lower your risk of all those conditions, usually by:\n\nimproving your diet\n\ntaking more exercise\n\ntaking medicines to lower blood pressure or cholesterol\n\nlosing weight\n\nstopping smoking\n\nIf you are 65 or over, you will be told the signs and symptoms of dementia to look out for.\n\nWhy this could be a 'life-saving step'\n\nSome people told the BBC the check had been time consuming.\n\nAnna Oxbury, from Cheltenham, said she had to go to her local hospital for the blood testing part of the check because her GP practice was unable to do it.\n\nShe said: \"I'm self-employed and reckon the 'free' health check, which meant three separate visits to practice and hospital, cost me over \u00a3100 in lost work time.\n\n\"My husband has an important job and could only make time for the check if he took a half-day holiday.

As a result, there'll continue to be some anxiety until the data can be examined.\n\n\"The highest resolution images taken at closest approach required perfect pointing, almost,\" said Project Scientist Hal Weaver. \"We think, based on everything we've seen so far, that was achieved.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Taken from a few hundred thousand km: A last image on approach to the target\n\nOther stories on the BBC you might like:\n\nUltima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe vast separation between New Horizons and Earth, coupled with the probe's small, 15-watt transmitter, mean data rates are glacial, however.\n\nThey top out at 1 kilobit per second. To retrieve all of the imagery stored on the probe is therefore expected to take until September 2020.\n\nThe first of the very highest resolution pictures are not expected on Earth until February. But this wouldn't delay the science, said Principal Investigator Alan Stern.\n\n\"The [lower resolution] images that come down this week will already reveal the basic geology and structure of Ultima for us, and we're going to start writing our first scientific paper next week,\" he told reporters.\n\nEven just the final picture released from the approach phase to the flyby contained tantalising information. Ultima appears in it as just a blob, but immediately it has allowed researchers to refine their estimate of the object's size - about 35km by 15km.\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 30km across), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nAlan Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mother of the Hubble: Tributes paid to Nasa scientist", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46720014", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Roman had a lifelong fascination with the stars\n\nTributes are being paid to Dr Nancy Grace Roman, the first woman to hold an executive position at the US space agency Nasa.\n\nDr Roman was known as \"Mother of the Hubble\" for her work on the early stages of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nNasa said her most important legacy was the advancement of women in the sciences and the generations of young scientists she inspired.\n\nShe died in Maryland on Wednesday at the age of 93.\n\nDr Roman was fascinated by the clear night skies of her childhood home in Nevada from a very early age.\n\nShe joined an astronomy club when she was just 11 and her passion for stargazing continued throughout her life.\n\nBut the young Dr Roman had to fight prejudice to be allowed to study maths and science at school and university.\n\n\"I still remember asking my high school guidance teacher for permission to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin,\" she once told the Voice of America.\n\n\"She looked down her nose at me and sneered, 'What lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?'

Three years ago, the UK was exporting half a million tonnes of plastic to China and Hong Kong - accounting for almost two-thirds of all our plastic sent abroad.\n\nChina introduced its ban on \"foreign garbage\" as part of a move to upgrade its industries 12 months ago. At the time, the UK recycling industry warned that the decision would be a \"game-changer\" and that it would be a struggle to deal with the country's waste.\n\nWhere is that plastic mountain?\n\nWell, it hasn't appeared - partly thanks to other countries taking our waste plastic instead, and partly because we are burning more of it.\n\nIn the wake of mass public alarm about plastic pollution we may also be producing less plastic waste, although it's impossible to be sure of the figures\n\nWho has taken our waste instead of China?\n\nIn the 12 months to October 2018, our analysis of Environment Agency figures shows that the UK exported a total of 611,000 tonnes of recovered plastic packaging to other countries.\n\nIn the previous 12-month period (ie to October 2017), the UK exported 683,000 tonnes.\n\nSo that works out as a drop in exports of 72,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-2018.\n\nIt's clear that other countries have imported much of the plastic packaging previously reprocessed by China.\n\nBut incineration in the UK has also increased, and we may be seeing the benefits of the Blue Planet effect on public behaviour.\n\nThe fact is we can't be certain from the data what exactly has happened to the shortfall.\n\nWhere did our plastic packaging go in 2018?\n\nWell, where there's waste plastic there's potentially profit - because some of it can be lucratively recycled. So some nations have geared up their reprocessing plants to welcome our waste with open arms.\n\nMany Chinese recyclers moved their operations abroad to benefit from cheap flows of plastic in the region before then re-exporting it back to China as recycled pellets.\n\nBut not all of it has been welcomed. Several countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan have heavily restricted imports because shipments were blocking ports and the quality of the material being imported (from all countries) was poor.\n\nSo while the amount of plastic taken by China dropped by 94% between 2016-17 and 2017-18, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland and Indonesia led the pack in gobbling up the slack.\n\nMalaysia imported 105,000 tonnes in total and was way out in front. That total was 42,000 (68%) more in 2017-18 compared with the previous year.\n\nThe second most popular destination was Turkey (80,000 tonnes).\n\nPoland is in third place on the league table - although it actually received slightly less UK plastic in 2017-18 than it did in 2016-17. It's not clear why.\n\nIn fourth place is Indonesia, which along with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam - is in the top 10 for the quantity of waste plastics polluting the ocean.\n\nWhich countries recorded the biggest increase in UK plastic over the period?\n\nAnother way of analysing the data is to rank the numbers in terms of net increase (ie which countries recorded the biggest increase in 2017-18 compared with 2016-17).\n\nOn this measure, Malaysia and Turkey remain at the top while Indonesia stays in the top five.\n\nThe new entries (replacing Poland and the Netherlands) are Spain and France. Spain recorded an increase of 14,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-18, and France was just behind on 9,000.\n\nOf course, sending material abroad for recycling doesn't necessarily mean it actually gets recycled.\n\nWaste firms in the receiving country may sift through the rubbish, take out the economically valuable material and burn or even dump the rest. The waste industry is notorious in some places for its links with criminal activity.\n\nThe global illegal waste trade is estimated by the UN to be worth between \u00a38bn-\u00a39.5bn a year.\n\nCase study: Malaysia\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Campaigners say illegal waste dumps in Malaysia have become a problem since China's plastic import ban\n\nSince China's ban, Malaysia has seen a big surge in the amount of plastic it has received from abroad, including from the UK.\n\n\"Malaysia is not able to process all of the imported waste, there are limited plastic waste factories\", says Mageswari Sangaralingam who works for the Consumers' Association of Penang and for Friends of the Earth, Malaysia.\n\nAccording to Ms Sangaralingam, not only is Malaysia receiving more plastic than it can properly dispose of, some of it is low-grade which ends up as landfill. There are also some rogue recyclers who, she says, burn plastic in the open - leading to environmental harm.\n\nThe Malaysian government has announced stricter conditions on the import of plastic and says it wants to phase it out over the next three years - but Ms Sangaralingam wants an immediate outright ban.\n\n\"Malaysia is not a dumping ground and hence should stop importing plastic waste,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Could Malaysia follow China's lead and ban plastic imports outright?\n\nWhat's the UK doing about the issue?\n\nThe British Plastics Federation (BPF) told us it was \"very worried\" about the export of poor quality plastic waste. The chairman of its recycling group, Roger Baynham, told us all that UK companies should make the very best efforts to ensure plastic goes to reputable recyclers:\n\n\"The export of plastic waste is out of the control of the industry and the BPF is particularly concerned about recent reports of illegal and fraudulent exports of plastic packaging waste routed to Asia through Holland.\"\n\nThe BPF also told us it would support a global accreditation system for the waste export sector and that recycling should be done at home.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove says the UK must stop \"off-shoring its dirt\". We asked the UK government why it didn't simply ban the export of waste plastic.\n\nWe were told that while the UK was committed to \"recycling more at home\" there is a \"legitimate export market for plastics particularly for countries that manufacture new products out of recycled plastic waste\".\n\nMr Gove wants to stimulate more recycling, but UK firms wanting to process more waste in Britain complain it's hard to get funding.\n\n\"There are very few countries left where we can comfortably export to and the market is shrinking,\" warns Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association.\n\n\"People don't want to buy this material, so where on earth is this all going to go?\" he adds.\n\nMr Ellin is largely supportive of the government's new waste strategy plan, but says the UK must expand its processing capacity at a faster pace:\n\n\"We're almost at a crisis point, unless we get a plan quickly,\" he says.\n\nLess than half of all household waste is recycled\n\nOverall recycling figures have stagnated and some councils are burning 80% of all residual waste, including recyclable plastic and paper.\n\nIn the 12 months to March, 50 of 123 councils incinerated more than half the household rubbish they collected, including plastic and paper, official figures recently revealed. The worst are in London. Westminster burned 82% of all household and recyclable rubbish.\n\nLess than half of all household waste (45.2%) was recycled in 2017 - a minuscule rise of just 0.3% on the previous year. The UK now seems unlikely to reach the EU-enforced target of 50% recycling in the next two years.\n\nThe Western Riverside Waste Authority, which covers Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Wandsworth, incinerated 79% as did Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. Slough, Kirklees, Sunderland, Portsmouth and Birmingham councils all incinerated at least 70% of all plastic, paper and household rubbish.\n\nSwindon Borough Council said in November it wants to burn plastic along with other rubbish rather than sending it abroad for recycling - saying some \"isn't properly recycled\".\n\nAnalysis by the BBC suggests that recycling rates are being hindered by the myriad of different rules which are in play up and down the country. It found that nearly half (47%) of Britons asked said they disagree about what should and should not be recycled.\n\nClaire Shrewsbury, from the recycling body Wrap, told BBC News: \"The time has come for the UK to take more responsibility for its own recovered materials, and move towards a circular system for plastics and other materials.\n\n\"There is a global market for high quality resource exports to countries that manufacture products, and this is something the UK should explore.\n\n\"This will require fundamental change from all of us. And that means regulatory transformation, collaborative industry action, together with citizen behaviour change.\"\n\nMs Shrewsbury aims her comments at anyone who buys stuff and throws packaging away.\n\nThat's all of us.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46616574", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The origin of Indians has been the subject of a heated debate\n\nNew research using ancient DNA is rewriting prehistory in India - and shows that its civilisation is the result of multiple ancient migrations, writes Tony Joseph.\n\nWho are the Indians? And where did they come from?\n\nIn the last few years, the debate over these questions has become more and more heated.\n\nHindu right-wingers believe the source of Indian civilisation are people who called themselves Aryans - a nomadic tribe of horse-riding, cattle-rearing warriors and herders who composed Hinduism's oldest religious texts, the Vedas.\n\nThe Aryans, they argue, originated from India and then spread across large parts of Asia and Europe, helping set up the family of Indo-European languages that Europeans and Indians still speak today.\n\nAs it happens, many 19th Century European ethnographers and, of course, most famously, Adolf Hitler, also considered Aryans the master race who had conquered Europe, although the German leader considered them to be of Nordic lineage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Harappan civilisation thrived in north-western India and Pakistan\n\nWhen scholars use the term Aryan, it refers to a group of people who spoke Indo-European languages and called themselves Aryans. And that is how I have used it in this article. It does not refer to a race, as Hitler used it or as some in the Hindu right wing use it.\n\nMany Indian scholars have questioned the \"out of India\" thesis, arguing that these Indo-European language speakers - or Aryans - were possibly just one of many streams of prehistoric migrants who arrived in India after the decline of an earlier civilisation. This was the Harappan (or Indus Valley) civilisation, which thrived in what is now north-western India and Pakistan around the same time as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.\n\nHowever, Hindu right-wingers believe the Harappan civilisation was also an Aryan or Vedic civilisation.\n\nTensions between the two groups backing these opposing theories have only increased in the last few years, especially since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in India in 2014.\n\nInto this long-running dispute has now stepped the relatively new discipline of population genetics, which has started using ancient DNA to figure out when people moved where.\n\nStudies using ancient DNA have been rewriting prehistory all over the world in the last few years and in India, there has been one fascinating discovery after another.\n\nThe most recent study on this subject, led by geneticist David Reich of Harvard University, was published in March 2018 and co-authored by 92 scholars from all over the world - many of them leading names in disciplines as diverse as genetics, history, archaeology and anthropology.\n\nUnderneath its staid title - The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia - lay some volcanic arguments.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dholavira in Gujarat state is one of the five largest Harappan sites\n\nThe study showed that there were two major migrations into India in the last 10,000 years.\n\nThe first one originated from the Zagros region in south-western Iran (which has the world's first evidence for goat domestication) and brought agriculturists, most likely herders, to India.\n\nThis would have been between 7,000 and 3,000BCE. These Zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent - the First Indians, descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who had reached India around 65,000 years ago - and together, they went on to create the Harappan civilisation.\n\nIn the centuries after 2000 BCE came the second set of immigrants (the Aryans) from the Eurasian Steppe, probably from the region now known as Kazakhstan. They likely brought with them an early version of Sanskrit, mastery over horses and a range of new cultural practices such as sacrificial rituals, all of which formed the basis of early Hindu/Vedic culture. (A thousand years before, people from the Steppe had also moved into Europe, replacing and mixing with agriculturists there, spawning new cultures and spreading Indo-European languages).\n\nOther genetic studies have brought to light more migrations into India, such as that of the speakers of Austro-Asiatic languages who came from south-eastern Asia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption India's population is made up of a number of layers, according to the research\n\nAs I write in my book, the best way to understand the Indian population is to imagine it as a pizza, with the first Indians forming its base. Though the base of this rather irregular pizza is thin in some places and thick in others, it still serves as the support that the rest of the pizza is built upon because studies show that 50% to 65% of the genetic ancestry of Indians derives from the First Indians.\n\nOn top of the base comes the sauce that is spread over the pizza - the Harappans. And then come the toppings and the cheese - the Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European language speakers or Aryans, all of whom found their way into the subcontinent later.\n\nTo many in the Hindu right wing, these findings are unpalatable. They have been campaigning to change school curricula and remove any mention of Aryan immigration from textbooks. And on Twitter, several hugely popular right-wing \"history\" handles have long been attacking India's leading historians who have defended the theory of Aryan migrations and continue to do so.\n\nFor Hindu nationalists, there is a cost to admitting that the Aryans were not the first inhabitants of India and that the Harappan civilisation existed long before their arrival. It would mean acknowledging that Aryans or their Vedic culture were not the singular fountainhead of Indian civilisation and that its earliest sources lay elsewhere.\n\nIndia's junior minister for human resource development, Satyapal Singh, was recently quoted in the media as saying: \"Only Vedic education can nurture our children well and make them patriots who have mental discipline.\"\n\nThe idea of the mixing of different population groups is also unappealing to Hindu nationalists as they put a premium on racial purity. There is also the additional issue of the migration theory putting Aryans on the same footing as latter-day Muslim conquerors of India - such as the Mughals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi - India is a predominantly Hindu nation\n\nThese are not just theoretical debates. The ruling BJP government in Haryana state, which neighbours the Indian capital Delhi, has demanded that the Harappan civilisation be renamed the Saraswati river civilisation. Since the Saraswati is an important river that is mentioned in the earliest of the four Vedic texts, such a renaming would serve to emphasise the link between the civilisation and the Aryans.\n\nThe new study puts an end to these debates and it has thus come as a shock to the Hindu right-wing.

These include \"plans\", or the early bureaucratic stages of preparing a project, \"tenders\", when bids are solicited from contractors to do the work, and \"construction starts\", when the building actually begins.\n\nEach of these figures tells a different story. While construction starts give a snapshot of the current level of settlement activity, they reflect decisions made years ago. In contrast, the planning and tender stages are seen as forward-looking indicators of a government's intentions.\n\nHighest level of planning since 2013\n\nThe data compiled by Peace Now showed a drop in construction starts during Trump's first year in office, to 1,643 units in 2017 from 3,066 units the previous year. This drop appears to reflect the lingering effect of reduced planning during the final two years of the Obama administration.\n\nBut the data for the first nine months of 2018 indicates the beginning of a Trump effect, with construction starts 20 percent higher than the same period a year earlier.\n\nThese trends are even more evident when looking at the planning process. In 2017, plans were advanced to build 6,712 new settlement homes, roughly 2.5 times the 2016 level.\n\nIn 2018, plans for an additional 5,618 units were advanced, nearly half of which were processed last week alone.\n\nTogether, these numbers are the highest level of planning seen since 2013. At that time, Israel pushed forward settlement construction to counter criticism of its release of Palestinian prisoners as part of then-Secretary of State John Kerry's peace efforts.\n\nThe biggest surge in settlement activity during the Trump era is in tenders - projects that are ready to be launched.\n\nIn 2017, 3,154 tenders were issued, up from just 42 during Obama's final year in office. In 2018, that number rose to over 3,800, the highest number by far since Peace Now started compiling the data in 2002.\n\nThis sets the stage for a huge jump in construction in the near future.\n\n\"There's definitely a change of atmosphere. There's definitely a change of winds,\" said Oded Revivi, mayor of Efrat, a major settlement near Jerusalem, and the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha settlement council.\n\nRevivi said that Obama pressured Israel into greatly curtailing settlement activity. Now, he said, Israel is trying to make up for lost time.\n\n\"Basically, what you're seeing now is the statistics are trying to catch up to the needs that were built up during the eight years of the Obama administration when everything was in a standstill,\" Revivi said.\n\nWhite House Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt's office declined to comment, and State Department officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\n'Trump effect'\n\nThe Palestinians and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal and obstacles to peace. Over 400,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank, in addition to 200,000 in occupied East Jerusalem. The Palestinians seek both areas, captured by Israel in 1967, as parts of their state.\n\nFor decades, a string of US presidents, both Republican and Democrat, condemned settlement construction.\n\n181015064919113\n\nThings quickly changed when Trump took office. Trump refused to condemn settlement construction and surrounded himself with advisers - including his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Ambassador to Israel David Friedman - who are Orthodox Jews with close ties to settlements.\n\nTrump at times has asked Israel to show restraint, but his administration has remained largely silent as Israel has pressed ahead with its construction efforts over the past two years.\n\nThis has been welcome news to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose outgoing right-wing coalition is dominated by religious and nationalist settlement sympathisers. Favoured to win re-election in April, Netanyahu has said he expects his next government to look very similar.\n\nIsrael never annexed the West Bank, meaning the Israeli military remains the sovereign there. Construction in the West Bank requires approval from COGAT, a Defence Ministry body that oversees civilian affairs in the territory.\n\nPlans are submitted by the government to COGAT's Higher Planning Council, which decides if they meet legal criteria. It claims to act in accordance with planning and building laws in the West Bank.\n\nCritics say COGAT routinely promotes settlement expansion and development at the expense of Palestinian communities in the 60 percent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli control.\n\nPalestinians have varying degrees of autonomy, including over building permits, in the remaining areas of the West Bank, where most Palestinians live.\n\nThe offices of Avigdor Lieberman, who served as defence minister in 2017 and 2018, and his deputy, Eli Ben Dahan, did not respond to requests for comment. Both are strong supporters of the settlements and settlers themselves\n\nThe settlement surge has added to the Palestinians' distrust of the White House.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I've seen in my four years living here,'' Snider said.\n\nThe partial federal government shutdown, now into its 11th day, has forced furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal government employees. This has left many parks without most of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and otherwise keep parks running.\n\nUnlike shutdowns in some previous administrations, the Trump administration was leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs, said John Garder, senior budget director of the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association.\n\n\u201cWe're afraid that we're going to start seeing significant damage to the natural resources in parks and potentially to historic and other cultural artifacts,'' Garder said. \u201cWe're concerned there'll be impacts to visitors' safety.''\n\n\u201cIt's really a nightmare scenario,'' Garder said.\n\n'Superintendent's discretion'\n\nUnder the park service's shutdown plan, authorities have to close any area where garbage or other problems become threats to health and safety or to wildlife, spokesman Jeremy Barnum said in an email Monday.\n\n\u201cAt the superintendent's discretion, parks may close grounds/areas with sensitive natural, cultural, historic, or archaeological resources vulnerable to destruction, looting, or other damage that cannot be adequately protected by the excepted law enforcement staff that remain on duty,'' Barnum said.\n\nIn the southern Sierra Nevada in Central California, some areas of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks were closed Monday evening. In Sequoia, home to immense and ancient giant sequoias, General Highway was closed because overflowing trash bins were spreading litter and posed a threat to wildlife and the icy, jammed roadway was seeing up to three-hour delays, according to the National Park Service.\n\nAlso closed was the Grant Tree Trail, a popular hiking spot, because the government shutdown halted maintenance and left the path dangerously slick from ice and snow, with at least one injury reported, the park service said.\n\nJoshua Tree troubles\n\nCampers at Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California's deserts were reporting squabbles as different families laid claims to sites, with no rangers on hand to adjudicate, said Ethan Feltges, who operates the Coyote Corner gift shop outside Joshua Tree.\n\nFeltges and other business owners around Joshua Tree had stepped into the gap as much as possible, hauling trailers into the park to empty overflowing trash bins and sweeping and stocking restrooms that were still open, Feltges said.\n\nFeltges himself had set up a portable toilet at his store to help the visitors still streaming in and out of the park. He was spending his days standing outside his store, offering tips about the park in place of the rangers who normally would be present.\n\n\u201cThe whole community has come together,'' Feltges said, also by phone. \u201cEveryone loves the park. And there's a lot of businesses that actually need the park.''\n\nSome visitors have strung Christmas lights in the twisting Joshua trees, many of which are hundreds of years old, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nMost visitors were being respectful of the desert wilderness and park facilities, Joshua Tree's superintendent, David Smith, said in a statement.\n\nBut some are seizing on the shortage of park staffers to off-road illegally and otherwise damage the park, as well as relieving themselves in the open, a park statement said. Joshua Tree said it would begin closing some campgrounds for all but day use.\n\nAt Yosemite, Snider, the local resident, said crowds of visitors were driving into the park to take advantage of free admission, with only a few park rangers working and a limited number of restrooms open.\n\nVisitors were allowing their dogs to run off-leash in an area rich with bears and other wildlife, and scattering bags of garbage along the roads, Snider said.\n\n\u201cYou're looking at Yosemite Falls and in front of you is plastic bottles and trash bags,'' he said.\n\nPrivate companies take over\n\nOfficials at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado said Monday they were closing restrooms and locking up trash bins in many locations.\n\nIn Yellowstone National Park, private companies have picked up some of the maintenance normally done by federal workers. The contractors that operate park tours by snowmobile, buses and vans are grooming trails, hauling trash and replacing toilet paper at pit toilets and restrooms along their routes.\n\nNearly all roads inside Yellowstone are normally closed for winter, meaning most visitors at this time of the year access park attractions like Old Faithful or the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone through guides. Those guides are splitting the cost of grooming the trails used by their vehicles to keep their operations going, said Travis Watt, general manager of See Yellowstone Alpen Guides based in West Yellowstone, Montana.\n\nThe tour companies can likely keep this system going through the entire winter season if they need to, Watt said.\n\n\u201cIt's definitely not our preference \u2014 the park service does a good job doing their thing and we hate to see them out of work,\u201d Watt said. \u201cBut it's something we can handle.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Fires Tear Gas Across Mexico Border to Stop Migrants", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fires-tear-gas-across-mexico-border-to-stop-migrants/4724784.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. authorities fired tear gas into Mexico during the first hours of the new year to repel about 150 migrants who tried to breach the border fence in Tijuana.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement later Tuesday that the gas was used to target rock throwers apart from the migrants who were trying to cross.\n\n\u201cNo agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away,'' the statement said.\n\nAn Associated Press photographer saw at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border near Tijuana's beach that affected the migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists.

Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee engaged in a war of words with the president on myriad issues over the past 18 months, generating headlines and fiery tweets from a president who generally insists on getting the last word. Those battles put them on the outs with many in their own party, and they paid a price. Both decided to retire rather than take on a difficult re-election campaign.\n\nFlake was far and away Trump\u2019s most consistent critic among Senate Republicans. Corker weighed in less often, but his description of the White House as an \u201cadult day care center\u201d rankled the president, who dubbed him \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker.\u201d The feud continued as Corker headed for the exits, with Trump asserting that Corker\u2019s promise to serve only two terms was not the real reason he retired. Rather, Corker \u201cwanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn\u2019t endorse him,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nCorker replied: \u201cYes, just like Mexico is paying for the wall... #AlertTheDaycareStaff.\u201d\n\nFor now, don\u2019t expect any Republican senator to take their place as chief agitator when the new Congress convenes Thursday, said Rory Cooper, a GOP strategist who helped lead the \u201cNever Trump PAC\u201d during the 2016 Republican primary. He said publicly criticizing the president makes Republican votes back home unhappy and earns the ire of the president. Meanwhile, Democratic voters and the media give them too little credit, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is not an incentive structure for senators who disagree with or oppose the president to speak out right now, but that could change if the (Robert) Mueller investigation continues to move in the direction it has been or the economy churns negative,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nTwo other Republicans, Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have both had their public run-ins with the president.\n\nThroughout his Senate campaign, Romney insisted that he would agree with Trump on some issues and not be shy about disagreeing on others. Romney appears to have more room with GOP voters in Utah to take on the president. Most voters in Utah \u2014 64 percent \u2014 would like to see the senator confront the president, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of midterm voters.\n\nBut Cooper said he doubts that\u2019s a mantle Romney wants to take on, at least not right away. After serving as governor of Massachusetts, Romney will be focused on proving that he\u2019s an advocate for Utah, Cooper said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where his head will be at the outset,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nSasse has frequently criticized Trump for what he considers the president\u2019s uncivil rhetoric. Sasse has also said he \u201cregularly\u201d considers leaving his party and becoming an independent. He is up for re-election in 2020 and has said he\u2019ll decide by the summer whether to seek a second term. It would be tricky terrain for Sasse to publicly battle with Trump, who won the state in 2016 by 25 percentage points.\n\nSenate Republicans chafe at the notion they are unwilling to take on a president whose statements and policy positions often run counter to traditional conservative positions.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he raised his concerns about trade policy privately with the president.\n\n\u201cI want results,\u201d Rounds said, \u201cinstead of hardening positions.\u201d\n\nRounds said he rode with Trump after meeting him at the airport when the president visited South Dakota during the midterm election season, telling him the state\u2019s soybean farmers were facing losses of some $500 million because of retaliatory tariffs. He said Trump told him: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a better deal for them. If they hang with me, we\u2019re going to make this better.\u201d\n\nRounds said his job is to make things better and \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I have to be out there in front fighting with someone.\u201d\n\nSen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said \u201cthere\u2019s all sorts of active disagreements that go on\u201d with the White House behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cI support the president as well as anybody. Behind closed doors, there are things on tariffs and things like that where we\u2019ve offered a differing opinion. But I support this president in terms of what he\u2019s trying to do. This agenda is working,\u201d Perdue said, citing strong economic growth and low unemployment.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he suspects the 2020 elections will prompt more Republican senators to confront Trump when they disagree with him, and that may already be happening, citing recent actions on Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Senate passed a measure that blamed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and called on Riyadh to \u201censure appropriate accountability.\u201d Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The resolutions showed senators seeking to assert oversight of Trump administration foreign policy and the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cAlmost half of their caucus is up for re-election. They just saw what happened in 2018,\u201d Durbin said of Republicans, who lost the House majority to Democrats. \u201cI think, once they do polling back home, not all of them, but many of them will find that independence is being rewarded.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "New Acting Chief: Pentagon 'Focused on Safeguarding Our Nation'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/new-acting-chief-pentagon-focused-on-safeguarding-our-nation-/4723997.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan said Tuesday the department \"remains focused on safeguarding our nation,\" as he officially took over the post left by the resignation of Jim Mattis.\n\n\"I now look forward to working with President Trump to carry out his vision alongside strong leaders including the service secretaries, the Joints Chiefs of Staff, the combatant commanders, and senior personnel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense,\" Shanahan said in a statement.\n\nUnlike Mattis, who came to the Pentagon as a revered former Marine general who served in Afghanistan, Shanahan does not have any military experience.

The spacecraft zoomed within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of it, more than three times closer than the Pluto flyby.\n\nOperating on autopilot, New Horizons was out of radio contact with controllers at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory from late Monday afternoon until late Tuesday morning. Scientists wanted the spacecraft staring down Ultima Thule and collecting data, not turning toward Earth to phone home.\n\nMission operations manager Alice Bowman said she was more nervous this time than she was with Pluto in 2015 because of the challenges and distance, so vast that messages take more than six hours, one way, to cross the 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers). When a solid radio link finally was acquired and team members reported that their spacecraft systems were green, or good, she declared with relief: \u201cWe have a healthy spacecraft.'' Later, she added to more applause: \u201cWe did it again.''\n\nFlyby earns standing ovation\n\nCheers erupted in the control center and in a nearby auditorium, where hundreds more \u2014 still weary from the double countdowns on New Year's Eve \u2014 gathered to await word. Scientists and other team members embraced and shared high-fives, while the spillover auditorium crowd gave a standing ovation.\n\nStern, Bowman and other key players soon joined their friends in the auditorium, where the celebration continued and a news conference took place. The speakers took delight in showing off the latest picture of Ultima Thule , taken just several hundred-thousand miles (1 million kilometers) before the 12:33 a.m. close approach.\n\n\u201cUltima Thule is finally revealing its secrets to us,'' said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins.\n\nBased on the early, rudimentary images, Ultima Thule is highly elongated \u2014 about 20 miles by 10 miles (32 kilometers by 16 kilometers). It's also spinning end over end, although scientists don't yet know how fast.\n\nAs for its shape, scientists say there are two possibilities.\n\nUltima Thule is either one object with two connected lobes, sort of like a spinning bowling pin or peanut still in the shell, or two objects orbiting surprisingly close to one another. A single body is more likely, they noted. An answer should be forthcoming Wednesday, once better, closer pictures arrive.\n\nBy week's end, \u201cUltima Thule is going to be a completely different world, compared to what we're seeing now,'' Weaver noted.\n\nColor close-ups in February\n\nStill, the best color close-ups won't be available until February. Those images should reveal whether Ultima Thule has any rings or moons, or craters on its dark, reddish surface. Altogether, it will take nearly two years for all of New Horizons' data to reach Earth.\n\nThe observations should help scientists ascertain how deep-freeze objects like Ultima Thule formed, along with the rest of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nAs a preserved relic from that original time, Ultima Thule also promises to shed light on the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, in which hundreds of thousands of objects reside well beyond Neptune.\n\n\u201cThis mission's always been about delayed gratification,'' Stern reminded reporters. He noted it took 12 years to sell the project, five years to build it and nine years to reach the first target, Pluto.\n\nIts mission now totaling $800 million, the baby grand piano-sized New Horizons will keep hurtling toward the edge of the solar system, observing Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs, from afar, and taking cosmic particle measurements. Although NASA's Voyagers crossed the Kuiper Belt on their way to true interstellar space, their 1970s-era instruments were not nearly as sophisticated as those on New Horizons, Weaver noted, and the twin spacecraft did not pass near any objects known at the time.\n\nNext flyby 2020\n\nThe New Horizons team is already pushing for another flyby in the 2020s, while the nuclear power and other spacecraft systems are still good.\n\nBowman takes comfort and pleasure in knowing that long after New Horizons stops working, it \u201cwill keep going on and on.''\n\n\u201cThere's a bit of all of us on that spacecraft,'' she said, \u201cand it will continue after we're long gone here on Earth.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Low Carb? Low Fat? What Latest Dieting Studies Tell Us", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/low-carb-low-fat-what-latest-dieting-studies-tell-us/4724763.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Bacon and black coffee for breakfast, or oatmeal and bananas?\n\nIf you're planning to try to lose weight in 2019, you're sure to find a fierce debate online and among friends and family about how best to do it. It seems like everyone has an opinion, and new fads emerge every year.\n\nTwo major studies last year provided more fuel for a particularly polarizing topic \u2014 the role carbs play in making us fat. The studies gave scientists some clues, but, like other nutrition studies, they can't say which diet \u2014 if any \u2014 is best for everyone.\n\nThat's not going to satisfy people who want black-and-white answers, but nutrition research is extremely difficult and even the most respected studies come with big caveats. People are so different that it's all but impossible to conduct studies that show what really works over long periods of time.\n\nBefore embarking on a weight loss plan for the new year, here's a look at some of what was learned last year.\n\nFewer carbs, fewer pounds?\n\nIt's no longer called the Atkins Diet, but the low-carb school of dieting has been enjoying a comeback. The idea is that the refined carbohydrates in foods like white bread are quickly converted into sugar in our bodies, leading to energy swings and hunger.\n\nBy cutting carbs, the claim is that weight loss will be easier because your body will instead burn fat for fuel while feeling less hungry. A recent study seems to offer more support for low-carb proponents. But, like many studies, it tried to understand just one sliver of how the body works.\n\nThe study, co-led by an author of books promoting low-carb diets, looked at whether varying carb levels might affect how the body uses energy. Among 164 participants, it found those on low-carb diets burned more total calories than those on high-carb diets.\n\nThe study did not say people lost more weight on a low-carb diet \u2014 and didn't try to measure that. Meals and snacks were tightly controlled and continually adjusted so everyone's weights stayed stable.\n\nDavid Ludwig, a lead author of the paper and researcher at Boston Children's Hospital, said it suggests limiting carbs could make it easier for people to keep weight off once they've lost it. He said the approach might work best for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes.\n\nLudwig noted the study wasn't intended to test long-term health effects or real-world scenarios where people make their own food. The findings also need to be replicated to be validated, he said.\n\nCaroline Apovian of Boston University's School of Medicine said the findings are interesting fodder for the scientific community, but that they shouldn't be taken as advice for the average person looking to lose weight.\n\nDo I avoid fat to be skinny?\n\nFor years people were advised to curb fats, which are found in foods including meat, nuts, eggs, butter and oil. Cutting fat was seen as a way to control weight, since a gram of fat has twice as many calories than the same amount of carbs or protein.\n\nMany say the advice had the opposite effect by inadvertently giving us license to gobble up fat-free cookies, cakes and other foods that were instead full of the refined carbs and sugars now blamed for our wider waistlines.\n\nNutrition experts gradually moved away from blanket recommendations to limit fats for weight loss. Fats are necessary for absorbing important nutrients and can help us feel full. That doesn't mean you have to subsist on steak drizzled in butter to be healthy.\n\nBruce Y. Lee, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins, said the lessons learned from the anti-fat fad should be applied to the anti-carb fad: Don't oversimplify advice.\n\n\"There's a constant look for an easy way out,\" Lee said.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nAnother big study this past year found low-carb diets and low-fat diets were about equally as effective for weight loss. Results varied by individual, but after a year, people in both groups shed an average of 12 to 13 pounds.\n\nThe author noted the findings don't contradict Ludwig's low-carb study. Instead, they suggest there may be some flexibility in the ways we can lose weight. Participants in both groups were encouraged to focus on minimally processed foods like produce and meat prepared at home. Everyone was advised to limit added sugar and refined flour.\n\n\"If you got that foundation right, for many, that would be an enormous change,\" said Christopher Gardner of Stanford University and one of the study's authors.\n\nLimiting processed foods could improve most diets by cutting down overall calories, while still leaving wiggle room for people's preferences. That's important, because for a diet to be effective, a person has to be able to stick to it. A breakfast of fruit and oatmeal may be filling for one person, but leave another hungry soon after.\n\nGardner notes the study had its limitations, too. Participants' diets weren't controlled. People were instead instructed on how to achieve eating a low-carb or low-fat in regular meetings with dietitians, which may have provided a support network most dieters don't have.\n\nWhat works?\n\nIn the short term you can probably lose weight by eating only raw foods, or going vegan, or cutting out gluten, or following another diet plan that catches your eye. But what will work for you over the long term is a different question.\n\nZhaoping Li, director of clinical nutrition division at the University of California, Los Angeles, says there is no single set of guidelines that help everyone lose weight and keep it off. It's why diets often fail \u2014 they don't account for the many factors that drive us to eat what we do.\n\nTo help people lose weight, Li examines her patients' eating and physical activity routines to identify improvements people will be able to live with.\n\n\"What sticks is what matters,\" Li said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Extreme Weather Becoming the New Normal", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/extreme-weather-becoming-the-new-normal/4723931.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Extreme weather events are on the rise and climate change is playing a role in both the frequency and intensity of the bad weather the world is seeing.

Also on display will be refinements to autonomous transportation and gadgets taking advantage of 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks.\n\nBut the celebration of innovation will be mixed with concerns about public trust in new technology and other factors that could cool the growth of a sizzling economic sector.\n\n\"I think 2019 will be a year of trust-related challenges for the tech industry,\" said Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research.\n\nCES features 4,500 exhibitors across 2.75 million square feet (250,000 square meters) of exhibit space showcasing artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, smart homes, smart cities, sports gadgets and other cutting-edge devices. Some 182,000 trade professionals are expected.\n\nMuch ado about data\n\nThere will be a focus on artificial intelligence that can \"personalize\" a user's experience with a device or a car, or even predict what someone is seeking \u2014 whether it's music or medical care.\n\nBut because this ecosystem is built around data, confidence has been eroded by scandals involving Facebook, Google and other guardians of private information.\n\n\"The public is wary because of recent events,\" said Roger Kay, analyst and consultant with Endpoint Technologies Associates. \"I think the industry will be slowed by this skepticism.\"\n\nCarolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said, \"You'll definitely hear people talk about security more, and really looking at how you secure the data,\" at CES.\n\nTrade frictions\n\nThe Consumer Technology Association, which operates the show, acknowledges that the sector is being hurt by tariffs and trade frictions between the two largest economic players, the United States and China.\n\nTariffs on tech products jumped to $1.3 billion in October, according to CTA, raising fears about growth.\n\n\"It's almost inevitable that an economic slowdown will occur if these tariffs continue,\" said Sage Chandler, CTA vice president for international trade.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade issues and the arrest of a top executive of Chinese giant Huawei in Canada have thrown into question the \"supply chain,\" the system in which U.S. designs are manufactured in China for the global market.\n\n\"This does cast a shadow over CES,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nAI and personalization\n\nThe auto sector will again have a major presence at CES with most major manufacturers on hand, some with prototypes of self-driving vehicles.\n\nJapanese carmaker Honda will be showing an \"autonomous work vehicle\" which can be configured for search and rescue operations, firefighting and other uses.\n\nOther exhibitors will be showing technology designed to serve as the \"brains\" of self-driving vehicles, not only for navigation but to create a better, more personalized \"user experience\" for travelers.\n\nThe show includes startups offering \"predictive\" health care solutions designed to anticipate the kind of care senior citizens may need.\n\nFacial recognition, which is already being used on many smartphones, will be incorporated into vehicles, doorbells and security systems as part of efforts to increase personalization and improve security.\n\nAnd consumer products group Procter & Gamble, making its first appearance at CES, will demonstrate ways to use facial recognition and AI for improved skin care and beauty recommendations.\n\nThe new applications raise questions on whether consumers are ready for technologies that evoke the notion of Big Brother and a surveillance state.\n\nBrenda Leong, senior counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington think-tank, said consumers should be mindful about whether data from facial recognition is kept only on the devices, such as in the iPhone, or held in a database.\n\n\"Even if commercial institutions are collecting the data, everybody is worried about government access,\" she said.\n\nPatrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said consumers have shown a willingness to adopt these new technologies if they offer convenience.\n\n\"If they are balanced from a benefit point of view, those worries are going to go away,\" he said.\n\nMoorhead noted that as facial recognition has become a standard feature for many smartphones, \"those fears have faded.\"\n\nO'Donnell said consumers are starting to understand more about data and become more discerning about which companies and devices they trust.\n\n\"Personalization is something people want, and they are willing to give up some privacy to get it,\" he said.\n\n\"But if they can get personalization on the device without sending it to the cloud, they get the benefits without giving up privacy.\""}, {"site":

unfinished eight-story building in an expansive field in Konza dotted with zebra and antelope \u2014 the only visible sign of progress in a decade-old plan to make Kenya into Africa's leading technology hub by 2030.\n\nGrandiose plans, red tape and a lack of funding have left Konza Technopolis \u2014 the $14.5 billion new city to be built some 60 km (37 miles) southeast of Nairobi \u2014 way behind schedule on its goal of having 20,000 people on site by 2020.\n\n\"It has taken too long and I think people have moved on,\" said tech entrepreneur Josiah Mugambi, founder of Alba.one, a Nairobi-based software company, who was initially excited by the government's ambitious project.\n\nDubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a smart city \u2014 using tech to manage water and electricity efficiently and reduce commuting time \u2014 and a solution to the rapid, unplanned urbanization which has plagued existing cities.\n\nAbout 40 percent of Africa's 1 billion people live in towns and cities and the World Bank predicts the urban population will double over the next 25 years, adding pressure to already stretched infrastructure.\n\nKonza's dream is to become a top business process outsourcing hub by 2030, with on-site universities training locals to feed into a 200,000-strong tech-savvy workforce providing IT support and call center services remotely.\n\nBut the first building has yet to be completed on the 5,000-acre former cattle ranch, three years after breaking ground, and business has shifted its focus to other African countries, like Rwanda, with competing visions to become modern tech hubs.\n\n\"Nobody can wait that long for a city to be built. For a tech entrepreneur, they think about where their startup will be two to three years down the line,\" said Mugambi.\n\nOther smart cities planned across Africa include Nigeria's Eko Atlantic City near Lagos that will house 250,000 people on land reclaimed from the sea, Ghana's Hope City and an Ethiopian city styled as the real Wakanda after the film \"Black Panther.\"\n\nUtopian\n\nBringing such utopian schemes to life is no easy task for African governments that are struggling to provide adequate roads, power, water and security to their existing cities.\n\n\"Upgrading infrastructure in places like Kibera (slum) in Nairobi to provide water and a better sewerage system is equally as important as building a new city such as Konza,\" said Abdu Muwonge, a senior urban specialist with the World Bank in Kenya.\n\nSome critics say Konza was ill-conceived from the start.\n\n\"The vision is wrong; the vision is too big,\" said Aly-Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based independent financial analyst.\n\n\"This is miles from anywhere. There are not leveraging the existing infrastructure ... It is assuming that you can bring in academia, you can bring in venture capital, you can bring in corporates.\"\n\nThe first serious hurdle arose in 2012 when the National Land Commission (NLC), which manages public land, introduced a cumbersome land acquisition procedure, said Bitange Ndemo, who led a team that conceived Konza Technopolis in 2008.\n\n\"The NLC was saying we should follow the processes of acquiring public land, which would take years to complete,\" Ndemo, now an associate professor of business at the University of Nairobi, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nThe delays caused at least one deal with a German university to fall through, he said, as the process was much slower than the old one where investors signed deals directly with government ministries which took care of land leases.\n\nTo resolve this, the government transferred ownership of the site to the Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KoTDA), set up in 2012 to co-ordinate development of the new city, which now allocates land to investors on 50-year renewable leases.\n\nCold Feet\n\nFinancing has also proven a major issue.\n\nIn its strategic plan, the government promised to fund 10 percent of Konza, laying the infrastructure, while the private sector would come in with the rest of the money to build universities, offices, housing and hotels.\n\nBut the government was slow to contribute its share and has yet to pass a law to create KoTDA as a legal entity which would make it easier to sign contracts with external lenders, said Lawrence Esho, one of Konza's project planners until 2013.\n\n\"They are way behind schedule partly because the government took time to give Konza money,\" he said, adding that no money came in until 2013.\n\n\"This stopped any work from starting at the site and investors may have developed cold feet as they waited.\"\n\nKoTDA's chief executive, John Tanui, said the government has committed to invest more than 80 billion shillings ($780 million).\n\n\"When I say committed does not mean we have absorbed. Our absorption is less than 10 percent of that figure,\" he said, without elaborating.\n\nThe government has stepped up funding since 2017, said Abraham Odeng, deputy secretary at Kenya's Information Communications and Technology ministry, without giving figures.\n\nOdeng pointed to a 40 billion shilling contract signed in 2017 with an Italian firm to build roads, water and sewerage infrastructure by 2021, funded by the Italian government.\n\n\"That is a concessional loan, which is a long-term loan that the Kenyan government will pay,\" he said.\n\nDrop in the Ocean\n\nBut Kenya's growing reliance on loans is causing jitters, with the International Monetary Fund warning of an increased risk of default.\n\nThe Washington-based lender forecast Kenya's total public debt will reach 63 percent of economic output or GDP for 2018, up from 53 percent in 2016, citing the government's public investment drive and revenue shortfalls.\n\nThe World Bank's Muwonge said the issue is eliminating challenges for the private sector to do business.\n\n\"Getting Konza city off the ground will require that we pull in private capital with concessions for them to deliver certain kinds of infrastructure for which the government may not have resources,\" he said.\n\nFive local investors, including Nairobi-based software developer Craft Silicon and the state-run Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, are expected to build offices, residential buildings and hotels by 2020, KoTDA head Tanui said.\n\nBut critics say it is not enough.\n\n\"What (investors) have allocated so far is still a drop in the ocean,\" said Ndemo, the former government technocrat.\n\nAnd international interest is shifting elsewhere.\n\nRwanda \u2014 widely regarded as the least corrupt country in East Africa \u2014 launched its Kigali Innovation City in 2015, designed to host 50,000 people in universities and tech companies on a 70-hectare site outside the capital.\n\nThe $2 billion plan, due for completion by 2020, is seven times cheaper than Konza.\n\n\"All these other (cities) have better proximity, have better density and have better collaborative feedback loops,\" said financial analyst Satchu. \"We are now at a serious disadvantage vis-a-vis these other countries.\"\n\n($1 = 102.5000 Kenyan shillings)"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "NASA Probe to Make History New Year's Day", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-probe-to-make-history-new-years-day/4720809.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "NASA scientists are getting a very special New Year's Day gift.

The Brazilian capital had moved to Bras\u00edlia, the new planned city in the country\u2019s interior, a few years prior, but Rio remained the effective center of power, and somewhere in the city, President Jo\u00e3o Goulart was clinging to power.\n\nGoulart, a leftist who became president in 1961, had spent the days prior on the phone with a top military officer, Gen. Amaury Kruel. The general was hoping to prevent the collapse of Brazil\u2019s government by urging Jango, as Goulart was known to Brazilians, to fire prominent leftist officials and institute a slate of reforms that would please both the military and the centrist establishment in Congress that opposed Goulart\u2019s shifts to the left.\n\nGoulart refused. The military marched.\n\nBy the next morning, Goulart had fled to Porto Alegre. A few days later, he was in Uruguay. Brazil\u2019s democracy had collapsed.\n\nFive decades later, on the evening of Oct. 28, 2018, members of the Brazilian military were parading through the streets of Rio again. Green Army jeeps honked their horns and flashed their lights; soldiers standing atop them waved Brazilian flags as adoring crowds cheered their arrival.\n\nThis time, though, the military was not coming to depose a president, but to celebrate him. Jair Bolsonaro, a federal congressman and former Army captain, had just won the election to become Brazil\u2019s 38th president.\n\nMilitares brasileros desfilan por las calles de R\u00edo festejando el triunfo de Bolsonaro y la gente los vitorea. Qu\u00e9 pesadilla. pic.twitter.com/hh1gAiHA0r \u2014 Diego Iglesias (@IglesiasDiego) October 29, 2018\n\n\u201cWhat a nightmare,\u201d Argentine journalist Diego Iglesias tweeted in Spanish of the scene.\n\nBolsonaro, whose presidency will begin with a New Year\u2019s Day inaugural ceremony in Bras\u00edlia, has routinely praised Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which gave way to the return of democratic governance in 1985. And his rise to power shares many similarities with the military regime\u2019s: Bolsonaro has seized on widespread discontent and fatigue with an incapable and corrupt political establishment, on fervid opposition to a leftist party that had spent more than a decade in power, on an economic collapse that Brazil has only slowly begun to escape, and on rising levels of violent crime.\n\nAnd while he has pitched his surge to power as the result of a \u201cpopulist\u201d revolt, his base of support mirrors that of the old coup masters: wealthy financial elites, segments of the population willing to trade the rights and lives of the poor and marginalized for their own safety and economic prosperity, and traditional parties and politicians who refuse to acknowledge their own roles in creating the monster before folding themselves into his arms.\n\nAP Photo/Leo Correa In this Dec. 1, 2018 photo, Jair Bolsonaro, left, and Minister of Defense Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna attend a graduation ceremony at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Resende, Brazil.\n\nMuch like the military once did, Bolsonaro has threatened his leftist political opponents with violence and imprisonment. He has promised to deliver a political \u201ccleansing never seen before in Brazil,\u201d and threatened media outlets that report news unfavorable to him. His vice president is a former Army general who, in an interview with HuffPost Brazil, refused to rule out a return to military rule, and who has posited \u2014 over Bolsonaro\u2019s unconvincing objections \u2014 that the new administration could rewrite the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nThis is not exclusively a Brazilian phenomenon. Countries around the world, from Hungary to Turkey to the Philippines, have turned to noisy leaders who promise instant renewals and silver-bullet solutions under the banner of a right-wing, nativist \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2015 the preferred term of news outlets, even though the key constituencies backing these candidates tend to comprise the nations\u2019 elite.\n\nEach major election has become, in part, a referendum on the state of global democracy as a whole. And each victory for a right-wing, anti-democratic figure has paved the way for a similar candidate in the next major election somewhere else.\n\nOf the bunch, though, Bolsonaro might be the most pressing threat to a major democracy. Brazil\u2019s is the fourth-largest in the world, and the largest by population in Latin America. If it dies, this time, it won\u2019t be at the hands of the armed forces. It will be self-inflicted.\n\n\u201cThere have been very, very few military coups in Latin America over the last 35 years,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and author of How Democracies Die. \u201cSo I think that while increased public support for a military coup is troubling, it\u2019s much more likely Brazilian democracy will die at the hands of an elected leader.\u201d\n\nBrazil is about to show the world how a modern democracy falls apart.\n\n\u2018Democracy Hasn\u2019t Delivered\u2019\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Bolsonaro supporters rally and pray in Bras\u00edlia ahead of a New Year's Day inauguration ceremony that will make him Brazil's 38th president.\n\nIt was still too early for an afternoon beer when I passed the first vendor doling out ice-cold cervejas along S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Avenida Paulista on a Brazilian summer day in late November.\n\nPaulista, which splits one of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, was closed thanks to a mid-week holiday, storefronts advertised Black Friday sales, and a giant Christmas tree outside one of the shopping malls gave away the approaching holiday season. Locals and tourists alike perused pop-up tents selling handcrafted wooden bowls and art, and loudspeakers blared a pop soundtrack for the people who\u2019d come to do yoga in the street.\n\nAside from the occasional bit of political graffiti sprayed onto a lamp post or the sidewalk, there were barely any signs that throughout 2018, Brazilians had repeatedly swarmed Avenida Paulista to demonstrate in favor of and against Bolsonaro.\n\nIt was here, in July, that people in S\u00e3o Paulo joined the largest women-led protest in Brazilian history, as women and LGBTQ people who feared Bolsonaro\u2019s history of racist, sexist and homophobic statements urged Brazilians to vote for anyone else. \u201cEle N\u0101o,\u201d they yelled \u2015 \u201cNot Him.\u201d\n\nIt was also here that Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters gathered in mid-October for a rally meant to push him over the majority threshold he had fallen just short of in the first round of voting. At that demonstration, Bolsonaro, who had been stabbed on the campaign trail in September, told the crowd via a cell phone that, as president, he would target funding for the media and human rights groups. He vowed to give his opponent \u2015 former S\u00e3o Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party \u2015 and prominent leftist activists two options: \u201cLeave, or go to jail.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of November? \u201cEverything feels normal,\u201d a friend told me, \u201cuntil you watch the news.\u201d\n\nFERNANDO SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators take part in a protest against Bolsonaro organized under the hashtag #EleNao (#NotHim), in Rio de Janeiro on Oct. 20, 2018.\n\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro is a creature of the rot in his country\u2019s democratic institutions that had set in years before he\u2019d entered the picture, or that had been there all along.\n\nPower in Brazil has always remained concentrated largely among a white and wealthy elite; literacy and education rates are still low, especially among the poor; an over-militarized and under-trained police force has continued to kill large numbers of poor (and mostly black) citizens; and the return to democracy was marked by more than a decade of economic instability and hyperinflation that perpetuated vast social, racial and income inequality.\n\nStill, Brazil has spent much of the last several decades fashioning itself into a shining example of what a democratic Latin America could one day look like. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso stabilized the economy in the early 2000s, then leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a working-class firebrand, presided over a period of rapid growth that had Brazil\u2019s economy on pace to surpass those of France and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn da Silva\u2019s watch, expanded social welfare programs helped some 30 million Brazilians rise out of poverty, and broader affirmative action policies increased educational, health and employment access for black Brazilians, women, the poor and the indigenous. Violent crime fell to its lowest levels in decades. When da Silva left office in 2010, his approval ratings neared 90 percent. Brazil, it seemed, was finally working.\n\nOr was it? In 2010, Tiririca, a Brazilian clown, announced a run for a congressional seat in S\u00e3o Paulo and launched a campaign meant to parody the Brazilian political system. \u201cPior do que est\u00e1 n\u00e3o fica, vote no Tiririca,\u201d he said: \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse, vote Tiririca.\u201d He playfully satirized the corruption endemic in Brazilian politics, promising that he would \u201cenrich every Brazilian family \u2015 especially mine.\u201d\n\nThen he won, and that victory, in retrospect, might have been a sign of a lurking discontent that Bolsonaro would soon exploit.\n\nUeslei Marcelino / Reuters Tiririca, a Brazilian comedian and member of the Lower House of Congress, is congratulated after voting in favor of the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia, on April 17, 2016.\n\nBrazil was already one of the world\u2019s most unequal countries in terms of income distribution, and while the poor unquestionably benefited from the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s policies \u2015 including a hike in the minimum wage \u2015 the vast majority of the economic gains achieved under da Silva went to the richest 1 percent of Brazil\u2019s population. So even as a new lower-middle class earned more than it ever had, Brazil\u2019s obscene levels of income inequality likely expanded during the good years. Violent crime had been reduced, but not to levels befitting a developed democracy: Even before the economic collapse, Brazil was home to more than a dozen of the planet\u2019s 50 most violent cities.\n\nThings got worse: The economy collapsed in 2013, plunging millions out of work and millions more back into poverty. In 2014, a money-laundering investigation turned into the world\u2019s broadest political corruption investigation. Known as Operation Car Wash, or \u201cLava Jato\u201d in Portuguese, it has implicated hundreds of Brazilian politicians, including da Silva and outgoing President Michel Temer, of the centrist Democratic Movement Party. Violent crime has surged \u2015 there were more than 60,000 homicides in each of the last two years. President Dilma Rousseff, da Silva\u2019s hand-picked successor, was impeached in 2016. Da Silva was convicted on money-laundering charges in 2017 and imprisoned this year; Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\n\nCompared with their counterparts across Latin America, Brazilians have always shown a low level of support for democracy. That support has eroded even further amid the crises: In 2017, just 32 percent of Brazilians agreed when Latinobar\u00f3metro, which conducts polls across the region, asked if they agreed that \u201cdemocracy may have problems but is the best system of government.\u201d No other Latin American nation showed less support for democracy, while other surveys found that nearly two-thirds of Brazilians had lost faith in political parties, the presidency and Congress. More than half of Brazilians said they would support a more authoritarian style of government if it \u201csolved problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask people on the street if they\u2019re worried about what Bolsonaro may mean for democracy, it\u2019s not like people are particularly concerned,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cDemocracy,\u201d he said, \u201chasn\u2019t delivered what many of us have expected.\u201d\n\nEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him. Marcelo Amador Pereira, S\u00e3o Paulo resident\n\nThe PT, as the Workers\u2019 Party is known by its initials in Portuguese, has received much of the blame for the backlash that fueled Bolsonaro\u2019s rise. A great deal of this criticism is legitimate: Da Silva and the Workers\u2019 Party had risen to power on something resembling revolutionary hope \u2015 a belief \u201cthat it could use the established order in Brazil to benefit the poor, without harm \u2013 indeed with help \u2013 to the rich,\u201d as the British essayist Perry Anderson wrote in 2016.\n\nBy the time Rousseff was impeached in 2016, to the delight of millions of mostly middle-class and wealthy Brazilians who had marched in the streets demanding her ouster, the party had embraced a brand of economic austerity and engaged in the sort of corruption that alienated many of its own working-class supporters.\n\nIn addition to its usual base of elites, the counter-revolution in Brazil could now count on winning at least some support from the PT\u2019s natural constituency. Bolsonaro drew support from across the political and social spectrum, even from poor and black voters whom some of his most repressive policy goals will surely target. Polls ahead of the election showed that Bolsonaro led Haddad among black and mixed-race voters and women \u2015 and that he also earned a surprisingly large share of the vote from LGBTQ Brazilians \u2015 despite his racism, sexism and homophobia.\n\n\u201cEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him,\u201d Marcelo Amador Pereira, a black man who lives in S\u00e3o Paulo and lost his job during the Rousseff administration, told HuffPost Brazil before the election. \u201cBecause he is running against the PT, and I will not accept any part in what the PT did to Brazil.\u201d\n\nElite Failure \u2015 And Acquiescence\n\nGetty Editorial Protesters hold signs saying \"Temer Out\" in Portuguese to protest the unpopular centrist leader who took power after the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Temer's links to corruption and pursuit of unpopular economic reforms sent his approval ratings into the single digits for most of his two years in office.\n\nThe problem with pitching Bolsonaro\u2019s rise to power as a purely populist revolt, though, is that the main source of his support was not the poor and working classes that had once fervently backed the Workers\u2019 Party, but the same elites Bolsonaro constantly railed against, who have taken almost no responsibility for their role in creating the circumstances that made his ascent possible.\n\nHealthy democracy relies on mutual support for a basic set of rules, but in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election, Brazil\u2019s center-right establishment began to disregard the old consensus. The center-right Social Democratic Party, or PSDB, questioned the results of Rousseff\u2019s narrow re-election that fall, giving oxygen to fringe social media conspiracy theories that the Workers\u2019 Party president had benefited from election fraud.\n\nTwo years later, the centrist parties launched an effort to impeach her that looked less like an effort to hold Rousseff accountable than a chance for Brazil\u2019s establishment to seize via goo-goo crusade the sort of power it couldn\u2019t win at the ballot box \u2014 and protect itself from judicial and public scrutiny in the process. For others on the right, including Bolsonaro, it was merely an opportunity to rid Brazil of a leftist government that they claimed had waged a war on \u201cGod, family and the Brazilian people.\u201d\n\nPaulo Whitaker/Reuters Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff with Vice President Michel Temer, left, and outgoing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, right, on Jan. 1, 2011. Since then, Rousseff has been impeached, Da Silva has been imprisoned and Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\n\nOperation Car Wash, meanwhile, has long been viewed as a positive development for Brazilian democracy, an effort to rid the country\u2019s political system of the corruption that runs rampant through it. But it\u2019s undeniable now, even for the investigation\u2019s proponents, that it played a role in undermining democracy instead of bolstering it.\n\n\u201cOne of the undesired results of the Lava Jato case \u2015 this confrontation of corruption \u2015 is a very extreme polarization of the public debate in Brazil,\u201d said Bruno Brand\u00e3o, the Brazil director of Transparency International. \u201cIt also discredited the political system and the political class. And more worrisome, it discredited the democratic system itself.\u201d\n\nThe polarization isn\u2019t entirely the result of the corruption investigation \u2015 on the left and the right, the parties of implicated politicians have spent years trying to discredit Car Wash. Temer repeatedly attempted to curtail it; Congress tried to kill new anti-corruption legislation in the middle of the night; da Silva and the PT decried it as an elite effort to destroy the left, which wasn\u2019t entirely true, given that a rash of politicians from other parties were removed from office and sent to prison, too.\n\nBut the investigators themselves helped undermine the credibility of their cause and, by extension, democracy. Judge Sergio Moro, who spearheaded the Car Wash investigation, was responsible for the conviction of da Silva, who had led presidential polls before he was banned from the race thanks to the corruption case.\n\nMoro spent years positioning himself as apolitical, but his pursuit of da Silva took on an air of zealotry. The conviction was criticized as sloppy and legally questionable by independent Brazilian legal experts, and the timing of certain revelations from Moro \u2014 wiretapped phone calls between Rousseff and da Silva, released in 2016 in the midst of her impeachment; testimony accusing da Silva, Haddad and the PT of graft, unsealed the eve of the election \u2014 suggested the judge was putting a finger on the scales of the cases and, perhaps, the election. (In November, Moro agreed to serve as the head of the National Justice Ministry under Bolsonaro.)\n\nThroughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t win, but that he couldn\u2019t. When they didn\u2019t ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow.\n\nBrazil\u2019s elites and its media, meanwhile, underestimated the strength of the anti-establishment surge taking place under their feet, or the dynamics allowing it to fester. Over and over again throughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t win, but that he couldn\u2019t. When they didn\u2019t ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow; surely his worst, most provocative statements would be enough to convince Brazilians he was too radical a reactionary.\n\nBeneath the surface, Bolsonaro and his supporters took advantage of social media, amplifying his message across Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp \u2015 Brazil\u2019s most popular social network \u2015 exploiting both the existing distrust of Brazil\u2019s largest media outlets and the utility of those social networks for spreading news that was baseless and manufactured out of thin air.\n\nMembers of the media and political elite were sure that, with da Silva and the PT seemingly discredited, a moderate, establishment figure from the center-left or center-right would emerge. But Brazilians made their fatigue with the centrist establishment clear: Whereas the Workers\u2019 Party still won more seats than any other party in congressional elections, the center-right was crushed in the first round of voting. Cynicism, corruption and the pursuit of unpopular economic policies under Temer had left a vacuum on the right, and along came Bolsonaro to fill the void.\n\nBolsonaro wielded corruption as a cudgel against the PT from the start, turning its links to Car Wash into an all-out attack on its legitimacy and right to exist. The left, Bolsonaro suggested on his website, wanted to \u201cimport ideologies that destroy our identity\u201d as Brazilians. That appealed to growing evangelical and conservative movements, as well as segments of the middle classes that opposed the left\u2019s social liberalism, and played on a backlash against efforts to advance the civil rights of the poor, LGBTQ people and black Brazilians.\n\nThat Bolsonaro had adopted an anti-corruption posture merely as a campaign tactic \u2015 much like Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d \u2015 was evident even before he took office. Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Fl\u00e1vio, is already facing questions about potential corruption, and despite pledging that his government ministries would not include anyone convicted of corruption, Bolsonaro has appointed at least seven people who have been or currently are involved in such scandals, according to The Intercept. They include his chief of staff and his finance minister, Paulo Guedes \u2015 the University of Chicago\u2013educated economist and free marketeer whose close ties to Bolsonaro during the campaign gave Brazil\u2019s business elite the assurances they needed to cozy up to the supposed \u201cpopulist.\u201d\n\nAs with Trump, Bolsonaro\u2019s attack on corruption went beyond hypocrisy. It was a Herrenvolk appeal \u2014 spoils for the dominant class, banishment or marginalization for everyone else \u2014 and the tubthumping about corruption fit into larger themes about the contamination of Brazilian identity by the country\u2019s underclasses.\n\nFor the whole of history, as Hannah Arendt wrote, totalitarians have depended on a coalition between the elite and the mob. In Brazil, as elsewhere, the rise of a new authoritarian required the acquiescence of a patrician class unwilling to accept any of the blame for the systemic ills the country was facing. And while so much media attention was lavished on the ordinary folks who supported Bolsonaro, it was more significant that his levels of support rose with each step up the income ladder, thanks to elites who shared his disdain for the left and were happy to empower a fascist to thwart it.\n\nThe worst ills Bolsonaro would inflict would be reserved for the most vulnerable of Brazil\u2019s populations, anyway. The elites, as always, are exempt from the pain they cause.\n\n\u2018Bolsonaro Can Do Things Trump Can\u2019t Do\u2019\n\nAFP Bolsonaro will take power with high levels of public support for some of his most dangerous policy proposals \u2014 including his calls to allow police officers even more leeway to shoot and kill alleged criminals.\n\nIf this all seems to bear a striking resemblance to what happened in the United States, that\u2019s no coincidence. Bolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\n\nTrump, too, was merely a symptom of a larger disease, a product of declining faith among Americans in their democratic institutions. And Bolsonaro adopted many of Trump\u2019s strategies: He, too, encouraged violence against critics, appealed to nativist and racist fears, and suggested that if he lost, it would be the result of political rivals\u2019 shenanigans. He also called for imprisoning not just his opponent, but activists who worked on the left. He targeted civil society, suggesting that nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups would be shut down. He promised to give law enforcement even more leeway to kill on sight and decried the media as agents of fake news who were simply protecting the corrupt establishment.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s campaign, like Trump\u2019s, also made a habit of tossing out increasingly absurd and anti-democratic ideas, often filtered through his son Fl\u00e1vio, a congressman who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s de facto social media guru. Fl\u00e1vio and vice presidential candidate Gen. Antonio Hamilton Mour\u00e3o would suggest increasingly radical ideas \u2015 like, say, closing Congress if necessary \u2015 only for the elder Bolsonaro to gently walk them back if a reporter asked about them or if they generated too much scrutiny.\n\nThis strategy, deliberately or not, has the effect of making Bolsonaro look more moderate than he is while shifting the very grounds on which he is being evaluated. Now, a Bolsonaro who does everything short of closing Congress, rewriting the constitution or re-establishing military rule starts to resemble a committed democrat.\n\nBolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\n\nA key difference between Bolsonaro and Trump, though, is that the worst version of the former will have much more damaging effects on Brazilian democracy than the latter has had, or could have, in the United States.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro can do things in Brazil, potentially, that Trump can\u2019t do,\u201d Levitsky said, \u201cbecause Brazilian institutions ... are nowhere near as strong as they are in the United States.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s ministerial appointments include more former military officers to serve at once in a civilian government than in any since the end of the dictatorship. He has appointed ministers who wield the same paranoid, anti-\u201cglobalist\u201d rhetoric that became commonplace in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nBolsonaro and his choice to head the education ministry, Ricardo V\u00e9lez Rodr\u00edguez, are supporters of the Escolas sem Partido (Schools Without Party) movement, a previously fringe effort to prevent public schools and universities from \u201cindoctrinating\u201d students with leftist political ideologies. There were reports in the days after the election that some universities had been raided to rid them of books on fascism, and that professors and other academics who opposed the new president and had described him as a fascist were targeted and harassed.\n\nBolsonaro, too, has sent early signals that he will follow through on his threats to seize indigenous lands to open them to mining and agricultural interests; he has said Brazil should \u201cintegrate\u201d its indigenous tribes \u2015 which include those living on protected reservations, as well as uncontacted peoples \u2015 into Brazilian society against their wishes.\n\nEven in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil will become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression.\n\nIt is possible Bolsonaro will govern as a true autocrat \u2015 that he could take advantage of any small crisis to consolidate power and sweep aside democracy in a single act. He could close Congress; he could criminalize the Workers\u2019 Party and other leftist opposition parties and movements; he could criminalize dissent, protest and the free press.\n\nMore likely is that he will govern in a manner similar to Trump, targeting the press, political opponents and democratic institutions with a constant barrage of criticism that further erodes their credibility among his supporters and the public writ large, and has a chilling effect on legitimate opposition. Bolsonaro refers to nearly everything to his political left as \u201ccommunism,\u201d and has said his movement is meant to keep \u201cforeign ideologies\u201d from making their way to Brazil. Rather than outright dictatorship, Bolsonaro\u2019s reign could come to resemble the ugliest anti-left purge in American history.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like McCarthyism,\u201d Alexandre Padilha, a high-ranking member of the Workers\u2019 Party who served in da Silva\u2019s government, told me. \u201cHe hates everything that is left in Brazil, and thinks they should be eliminated, basically.\u201d\n\nTo the right, these fears and the rhetoric that has inspired them are a source of humor. The day before the inauguration, Carlos Bolsonaro \u2015 a Rio councilman and another of the new president\u2019s sons \u2015 posted a video on Twitter of his father celebrating police killings and calling his opponents \u201cpussies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left is crying,\u201d he said, mockingly.\n\nIn the U.S., Trump\u2019s continued attacks have had negative effects on how Americans view their elections, the press and other democratic institutions, and his rhetoric has emboldened racists and white nationalists and potentially contributed to rises in violent crime against racial, ethnic and religious minorities.\n\nPolitical violence is already shockingly common in Brazil: In 2018, Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco was assassinated while leaving an event, and 28 candidates were killed during 2016 election cycle alone. Bolsonaro\u2019s insistence that his supporters take aim at Workers\u2019 Party politicians could have deadly consequences.\n\nHis people have taken their cues: In the days before the election, Bolsonaro supporters proudly destroyed memorials to Franco in Rio, and the symbols of American white nationalism \u2015 including a flag of Kekistan, the mythical country created and worshipped by alt-right fanboys in online forums \u2015 began to show up at Bolsonaro rallies. The night of the election, his supporters waved banners commemorating the former Army colonel who carried out the military dictatorship\u2019s torture program.\n\nLGBTQ Brazilians, who are already subject to high rates of violence, are also fearful that Bolsonaro\u2019s aggressive opposition to their rights will give his supporters license to level even more attacks against them. And Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric on policing and public security has only emboldened some of the hard-line officers within Brazil\u2019s police forces, according to locals.\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, a young black writer who lives in a favela on the city\u2019s outskirts told me that he had been stopped by police five times in the first three weeks after the election, usually as he was returning to the neighborhood on the way home from work. In Rio, videos circulated last month of two men lying in the street, shot to death, before the police officers who killed them threw their bodies into the back of a pickup truck. Brazil\u2019s police already killed more than 4,200 people last year \u2015 in Rio, they were responsible for 1 in every 5 homicides across the state. Bolsonaro will likely make police forces even more deadly.\n\nOn this, he will have allies both in and out of politics. Brazilians overwhelmingly support aggressive stances on policing, and amid the violent crime epidemic, more politicians have adopted hard-line stances. Wilson Witzel, the incoming governor of Rio de Janeiro, has said the state will \u201cdig graves\u201d for the bodies of alleged criminals police kill. Newly elected S\u00e3o Paulo Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria, a politician who aligned himself with Bolsonaro during the campaign, has adopted similar rhetoric when it comes to protecting police accused of killing.\n\nBrazil\u2019s institutions may shield its democracy as a whole. But even in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil will almost certainly become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression there, from the state and otherwise.\n\nA Model For \u2018Really Egregious Illiberalism\u2019\n\nThe Independent Bolsonaro modeled his rise to power on Donald Trump's. Now, right-wing politicians across Latin America will likely take lessons from Bolsonaro's victory in Brazil.\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d a woman in S\u00e3o Paulo asked me as our hotel elevator hit the ground floor.\n\nWhen I told her I lived in Washington, D.C., she smiled and turned to her child. In Portuguese, she told him that I was from the same place as Trump.\n\n\u201cEveryone here wants to go there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say all bad things about him, but everyone here wants to move there.\u201d\n\nTo many Brazilians who support Bolsonaro, the chaos Trump has sown and the threats to the tenets of American democracy he poses are nothing to worry about. The U.S. economy, after all, is doing well, and Trump is, in their view, responsible. He\u2019s an outsider who came in and shook up the system, and the establishment just hasn\u2019t learned to cope with that yet.\n\nNow, there are others looking to Bolsonaro. In Uruguay, an upstart presidential candidate is already modeling himself as his country\u2019s version of Bolsonaro; in Argentina, which faces many of the same economic and corruption issues that have plagued Brazil, similar candidates \ufeffcould soon emerge.\n\n\u201cThe political right has not done well in Latin America in the last few decades,\u201d Levitsky, of Harvard, said. \u201cSo right-wing politicians are looking around for a new formula, and illiberalism \u2015 really egregious illiberalism \u2015 may be that formula. If he\u2019s perceived to be successful, it will be reproduced.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro wasn\u2019t the first right-wing authoritarian to put a major democracy under threat. Neither will he be the last.\n\n\u201cWe have Bolsonaro because we have Trump,\u201d Stuenkel said. \u201cWe would not have seen the same dynamic here without what happened in the U.S. in 2016. I think that inspired a lot of people who basically learned from Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think that same way,\u201d he continued, \u201cneighboring countries in Latin America will learn from Bolsonaro.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Kim Jong Un Says He's Ready To Meet With Trump Again In New Year's Speech", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-jong-un-new-year-speech-trump_us_5c2b249ce4b0407e90856989", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Tuesday he hopes to extend his high-stakes nuclear summitry with President Donald Trump into 2019, but also warned Washington not to test North Koreans\u2019 patience with sanctions and pressure.\n\nDuring his televised New Year\u2019s speech, Kim said he\u2019s ready to meet with Trump at any time to produce an outcome \u201cwelcomed by the international community.\u201d However, he said the North will be forced to take a different path if the United States \u201ccontinues to break its promises and misjudges the patience of our people by unilaterally demanding certain things and pushes ahead with sanctions and pressure.\u201d\n\nKim also said the United States should continue to halt its joint military exercises with ally South Korea and not deploy strategic military assets to the South. He also made a nationalistic call urging for stronger inter-Korean cooperation and said the North is ready to resume operations at a jointly run factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and restart South Korean tours to the North\u2019s Diamond Mountain resort. Neither of those is possible for South Korea unless sanctions are removed.\n\nSome analysts say North Korea has been trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul while putting the larger burden of action on the United States. Pyongyang over the past months has accused Washington of failing to take corresponding measures following the North\u2019s unilateral dismantlement of a nuclear testing ground and suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang are trying to arrange a second summit between Trump and Kim, who met in Singapore on June 12.\n\n\u201cIf the United States takes sincere measures and corresponding action to our leading and pre-emptive efforts, then [U.S.-North Korea] relations will advance at a fast and excellent pace through the process of implementing [such] definite and groundbreaking measures,\u201d said Kim, who delivered the speech sitting on a leather chair, wearing a black suit and gray-blue tie.\n\n\u201cIt is the unwavering position of our party and the republic\u2019s government and my firm will that the two countries as declared in the June 12 joint statement ... take steps to establish a permanent and stable peace regime and push toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we have already declared domestically and internationally and took various actions showing our commitment that we will no further create or test nuclear weapons and will not use or spread them.\u201d\n\nAdam Mount, a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said Kim appears to be hinting at an agreement that falls short of a full disarmament, but could still represent a major limitation of the North Korean threat \u2014 a cap that essentially freezes the North\u2019s rudimentary nuclear capability from growing or advancing further. In exchange, the United States would have to offer major inducements, including sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cU.S. negotiators should move decisively in the new year to find out how far Kim is willing to go toward a verified cap on his arsenal. Discussions on reducing or eliminating that arsenal come later,\u201d Mount said in an email.\n\nHowever, Kim\u2019s statement could prove problematic if there\u2019s ongoing evidence the North\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities continue to run. Private analysts have accused North Korea of continuing nuclear and missile development, citing details from commercial satellite imagery.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, signs of continued work on the arsenal were alarming but not duplicitous, because there was never a commitment to stop those activities,\u201d Mount said. \u201cThat may no longer be true, raising the risk that the White House feels cheated rather than just stonewalled.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s speech also points toward a difficult year for the U.S.-South Korean alliance with their military cooperation coming under pressure from Pyongyang, Seoul\u2019s process for inter-Korean engagement, and Washington\u2019s current inability to reach an agreement on cost-sharing for the U.S. military presence in South Korea. It will be critical for the allies to develop a firmer policy as it\u2019s clear the issue of joint drills is coming to a head, Mount said.\n\nIn the speech, Kim hailed the results of the North\u2019s diplomatic activities in 2018, including his three meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim said an inter-Korean military agreement reached in their last summit in September to reduce conventional military threats was \u201crealistically a non-aggression declaration.\u201d\n\nKim also emphasized the development of the North Korean economy and, without elaborating, mentioned nuclear power as part of the country\u2019s plans to boost electricity production.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government in a statement welcomed what it described as Kim\u2019s commitment toward peace and said Seoul plans to work closely with the international community for the denuclearization of the peninsula while also advancing inter-Korean relations to an \u201cirreversible level.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean leaders traditionally use New Year\u2019s statements to issue major policy goals for the year ahead. Kim used his New Year\u2019s speech a year ago to start a newfound diplomatic approach with Seoul and Washington, which led to his meetings with Moon and Trump. Kim also met three times with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which boosted his leverage by reintroducing Beijing \u2014 Pyongyang\u2019s main ally \u2014 as a major player in the diplomatic process to resolve the nuclear standoff.\n\nBut nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled in recent months as they struggle with the sequencing of North Korea\u2019s disarmament and the removal of U.S.-led sanctions against the North.\n\nThe North has also bristled at U.S. demands to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal.\n\nThe hardening stalemate has fueled doubts on whether Kim will ever voluntarily relinquish the nuclear weapons and missiles he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. In his meetings with Trump and Moon, Kim signed vague statements calling for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. The North used a blunt statement last month to reiterate its traditional stance on denuclearization, saying it will never unilaterally give up its weapons unless Washington removes what Pyongyang describes as a nuclear threat.\n\nThe statement jarred with Seoul\u2019s claim that Kim is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nukes and suggested that the North will potentially demand the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a major sticking point in any disarmament deal."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Jim Carrey's Gross Donald Trump Cartoon May Put You Off Your Food", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-donald-trump-stinker_us_5c2c6b38e4b05c88b703dc6e", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Jim Carrey had a productive holiday season, artistically speaking at least.\n\nThe actor (whose politically themed cartoons HuffPost has been extensively reporting on in recent months) unleashed a brand new series of images toward the end of December \u2015 with many of them taking aim at his regular target, President Donald Trump.\n\nCarrey saw out 2018 with this depiction of Trump appearing to serve up feces to the American public:\n\nOne last tweet about this Stinker for 2018.

They planned to pass them as soon as the new Congress convened Thursday.\n\nTrump spent the weekend saying that Democrats should return to Washington to negotiate, firing off Twitter taunts. He then revised his aides\u2019 comments to state that he really still wants to build a border wall. And last week, he blamed House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi for the impasse that led to the shutdown.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, after tweeting a New Year\u2019s message to \u201cEVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,\u201d Trump tweeted, \u201cThe Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.\u201d\n\nBut he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to Pelosi, who is expected to take over as speaker when the new Congress convenes.\n\n\u201cBorder Security and the Wall \u2018thing\u2019 and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let\u2019s make a deal?\u201d he tweeted.\n\nWhether the Republican-led Senate, under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would consider the Democratic bills \u2014 or if Trump would sign either into law \u2014 was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans would not take action without Trump\u2019s backing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won\u2019t sign,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nEven if only symbolic, the passage of the bills in the House would put fresh pressure on the president. At the same time, administration officials said Trump was in no rush for a resolution to the impasse.\n\nTrump believes he has public opinion on his side and, at very least, his base of supporters behind him, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nWhite House officials, including the departing chief of staff, had indicated that Trump\u2019s signature campaign pledge to build the wall would not be fulfilled as advertised. Chief of staff John Kelly told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published Sunday that Trump abandoned the notion of \u201ca solid concrete wall early on in the administration.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels \u2014 with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than the $5 billion Trump has said he wants for the wall \u2014 through Feb. 8 as talks continued.\n\nIt would also include another measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. It would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.\n\nDemocrats under Pelosi were all but certain to swiftly approve the package in two separate votes Thursday. They would take place after the election of a new House speaker, a contest Pelosi was expected to win as leader of the new House majority.\n\nThe White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the House proposal. Republican senators left for the holidays refusing to vote on any bills until all sides, including Trump, were in agreement. The lawmakers were frustrated that Trump had dismissed their earlier legislation.\n\nThe president has not said he would veto the Democratic legislation, if the bills were to land on his desk. But a prolonged crisis could hobble House Democrats\u2019 ability to proceed with their agenda, which included investigations of the president and oversight of his administration, including Russian interference in the election.\n\nAt least one Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, encouraged Trump to use the budget impasse as an opportunity to address issues beyond the border wall. But a previous attempt to reach a compromise that addressed the status of \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 broke down last year as a result of escalating White House demands. Graham said Trump was \u201copen minded\u201d about his proposal\n\nThe partial government shutdown began Dec. 22 after Trump bowed to conservative demands that he fight to make good on his vow and secure funding for the wall before Republicans lose control of the House on Wednesday. Democrats have remained committed to blocking any funding for the wall.\n\nWith neither side engaging in substantive negotiation, the effect of the partial shutdown was set to spread and to extend into the new year.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "World's Oldest Person, Jeanne Calment, May Have Faked Her Age: Report", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeanne-calment-worlds-oldest-person-faked-age_us_5c2bb81fe4b05c88b703705e", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "The woman who is believed the oldest person who ever lived may have padded her real age by 23 years.\n\nWhen Jeanne Calment died in August 1997, in Arles, France, her age was reported as 122 years and 164 days \u2015 an all-time record, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nHowever, Russian researchers now say that the woman claiming to be Calment was actually her 99-year-old daughter, Yvonne Calment.\n\nA new paper published by ResearchGate suggests that Jeanne Calment died in 1934 and Yvonne Calment assumed her identity so the family would not have to pay inheritance taxes, according to Inside Edition.\n\nSome of the evidence collected by mathematician Nicolai Zak and gerontologist Valeri Novoselov include an identity card issued to Jeanne Calment in the 1930s that does not list the same hair color or height that she had later in life, according to the San Jose Mercury News.\n\nIn an interview with LeafScience.org, Novoselov said Yvonne Calment\u2019s husband, Joseph Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Billot, never remarried, despite the fact that he was only 42 at the moment of her supposed death.\n\n\u201cThere were many mentions that he was getting along very well with Jeanne and they were raising Yvonne\u2019s son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jean Paul together,\u201d Novoselov said.\n\nHe added that he checked out a birth certificate of a maid that Jeanne Calment said took her to school as a child.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that she was 10 years younger than Jeanne, which means that she could only be taking her daughter Yvonne to school,\u201d he said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Jeanne Calment in Arles, France, in February 1996.

He is, however, the founder and face of the provocatively named Church of Safe Injection.\n\nWhat sets the Church of Safe Injection apart from faith-based addiction recovery programs is its insistence on science, a tenet Harvey, who went through the 12-step program a few years ago and is in recovery from addiction to alcohol, opioids and methamphetamine, holds closely. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m sober right now,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cMy recovery was not at all evidence-based,\u201d he added, referring to addiction treatment backed by scientific evidence. \u201cIn fact, a lot of it was evidence-hostile.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso setting it apart: It\u2019s not actually a church. Or a religion. At least, not yet.\n\n\n\nFar from a brick-and-mortar house of worship, Harvey has been running the \u201cchurch\u201d out of the back of his Honda Fit since October. One night a week, he parks his car by Lewiston\u2019s Kennedy Park, where drug users often congregate, and, along with a group of volunteers, distributes clean needles and Narcan, a brand of the overdose-reversal antidote naloxone, to anyone who stops by. All the while, Harvey preaches that Jesus would have embraced and supported people who use drugs, not shunned them. His philosophy has proven to be an appealing refuge for some religious people, who say they are frustrated that traditional church congregations have turned their backs on the vulnerable in the midst of a drug overdose crisis.\n\n\n\nThose people have taken up Harvey\u2019s cause, establishing 18 branches of the church across eight states. Each must abide by the organization\u2019s only three rules: Congregations are required to welcome people of all faiths, atheists included; to serve all marginalized people; and, most importantly, to support harm reduction, which involves keeping drug users safe and healthy, instead of focusing solely on getting them into addiction treatment.\n\n\n\nHarvey has plans to incorporate the church as a nonprofit, and then to apply for a religious exemption to the Controlled Substances Act so that he can open a safe injection site, where drug users who aren\u2019t ready for treatment would be able to inject in a clean, safe place, under supervision.\n\n\n\nHis timing couldn\u2019t be more urgent. Drug overdose deaths set a record in 2017, killing more than 70,000 Americans and surpassing other deadly crises like HIV, car crashes and gun violence during their peak years. The majority of those deaths, nearly 49,000 of them, were linked to opioids. Harvey feels certain that the 418 overdose deaths that happened in Maine in 2017 could have been avoided.\n\n\n\nThose who resist instituting these methods of harm reduction argue that these strategies jeopardize public safety and enable more drug use. Research shows that\u2019s not true.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have decades of solutions showing that those deaths can be prevented,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cOur religious belief is simply that people who use drugs don\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe science on needle exchanges is resoundingly clear. Numerous studies, backed by both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicate that these services reduce the transmission of bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, cut down on the number of used needles in public spaces and connect people who use drugs to addiction treatment.\n\n\n\nIn October, Harvey explained his rationale for starting the church in an op-ed he wrote for the Portland Press Herald.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll too often today, people who use drugs are offered only two choices,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet sober or die. Jesus would have rejected this shameful and lethal binary. He\u2019d have been on the front lines providing the third option that Maine and the United States so desperately need: harm reduction. Naloxone, safe injection sites, sterile syringes, the works.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut despite the evidence supporting them, needle exchanges remain controversial, especially in rural areas, where authorized exchanges are sparse. In parts of the southern and western United States, they\u2019re still banned altogether. In Maine, there are only six certified needle exchanges, most of which are clustered in a handful of counties in the southern part of the state, leaving large swaths of drug users in northern Maine without reliable access to clean syringes. There is not one in Lewiston.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closing in on the end of the second decade of this crisis,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re still having these discussions around syringe exchange, especially, is extremely frustrating.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven more controversial are supervised injection sites, which have yet to gain a foothold in the U.S., even in large, progressive cities. Despite research in Europe, Australia and Canada demonstrating their potential to save lives, they remain prohibited under federal law.\n\nNicolas Ortega for HuffPost A lack of public health services in Maine paved the way for experimental initiatives like the Church of Safe Injection.\n\nIf the Church of Safe Injection seems like a ragtag operation with quixotic plans, the authorities aren\u2019t taking it that way.\n\nThe response to Harvey\u2019s efforts was swift.\n\nBy the end of November, the Maine CDC had sent letters with a stern reminder about the rules for mobile exchanges to the organizations that run the state\u2019s certified exchanges. While Harvey wasn\u2019t mentioned in the letter, CDC spokeswoman Emily Spencer confirmed that \u201crecent media coverage of Mr. Harvey\u2019s endeavor\u201d had prompted the letters.\n\nAt the same time, after weeks of turning a blind eye to the uncertified mobile exchange operating less than a block from the police station in Lewiston, the police department warned Harvey that he could be charged with a misdemeanor if he continued to give out free needles.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to possess more than 10 syringes at a time in Maine. If Harvey had followed that law, he would have only legally been able to serve one person per night, he said. Instead, he stocked his trunk with as many as a thousand needles.\n\n\u201c[Harvey] is familiar with the laws and crimes for which he could be charged if he possesses or distributes hypodermic apparatuses,\u201d Lt. David St. Pierre of the Lewiston Police Department told HuffPost in a statement, noting that the department had been in touch with the Maine CDC.\n\nBy all outward appearances, Harvey has complied with the directive to stop distributing syringes out of his car, although he continues to distribute other supplies, including naloxone.\n\nHarvey said he didn\u2019t think the state CDC would approve his application to start a certified exchange because of his criminal record related to his own struggles with addiction, but said the church would exhaust its legal options before knowingly breaking the law. The CDC does take criminal convictions into account when considering applications, though they\u2019re not automatically disqualifying, according to Spencer, the CDC spokeswoman.\n\nAnd Harvey hasn\u2019t ruled out the prospect of civil disobedience in the future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to get arrested than a darling media recovery boy who opened five sober houses and is white, male, heterosexual and cisgender,\u201d he said.\n\nHis knowing bravado recalls a storied history of civil disobedience and activism, dating back to the crusaders who ran illegal needle exchanges during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and \u201990s.\n\n\u201cPublic health innovation has often pushed the boundaries of the law, and the law has followed,\u201d Beletsky said. \u201cOftentimes, public health officials do not lead, they follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the CDC would do more to support harm reduction around the country, instead of getting in the way,\u201d he added.\n\nCivil disobedience paid off in New York City, where in 1991, a judge ruled in favor of a group of activists known as the \u201cNeedle Eight,\u201d who were arrested for trying to distribute free syringes. The threat of AIDS was more damaging than any harm caused by violating the needle possession statute, the judge explained, noting that AIDS was threatening hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\n\u201cThis court is satisfied that the nature of the crisis facing the city, coupled with the medical evidence offered, warranted the defendants\u2019 action,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nOur religious belief is simply that people who use drugs don\u2019t deserve to die. Jesse Harvey, founder of the Church of Safe Injection\n\nBeyond the threat of a CDC crackdown, Harvey and the Church of Safe Injection face an even tougher road ahead in their quest to use religion to skirt the federal rules banning safe injection sites.\n\nResearch from Europe, Canada and Australia, which have operated safe consumption sites for decades, indicates that they may decrease disease transmission, drive down emergency calls and reduce fatal overdoses. But in the United States, action has lagged behind the evidence.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, where Harvey tried to start a conversation about safe injection sites at a city council meeting last year, a city-authorized safe injection site seemed all but off the table. It was that stonewalling at the local level that prompted Harvey to take matters into his own hands, he said.\n\nBigger cities like New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle, are proceeding with plans for supervised consumption sites, even as the Justice Department has vowed swift and aggressive action against any violator of the federal law against injection sites.\n\nYet significant public conversations about safe injection have largely been isolated in a handful of municipalities. \u201c[It\u2019s] evidence that nowhere near enough public health professionals are taking this seriously,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nIn that fraught environment, Harvey sees a religious exemption as an opening. As precedent, he cited a 2006 Supreme Court ruling that found a small religious sect could continue to import ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic tea, for its religious rituals.\n\nEugene Volokh, who teaches religious law at the UCLA School of Law, said that it\u2019s certainly possible for a small religious group to prevail in an exemption case. The 2006 ayahuasca case only included about 130 people in the American branch, he said. But unlike the Church of Safe Injection, that religion was founded in Brazil 45 years before the Supreme Court ruled in the group\u2019s favor. \u201cIt does help if it looks like something that wasn\u2019t just made up for legal purposes,\u201d Volokh said.\n\nPublic health innovation has often pushed the boundaries of the law, and the law has followed. Leo Beletsky, associate professor of law and health science, Northeastern University\n\nIn November, before the police crackdown, a group of volunteers, including a public health worker, a food pantry organizer and a substance abuse counselor who had previously been a street minister, circled up around the trunk of Harvey\u2019s car in the half-light.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to destigmatize public health,\u201d he told them.\n\nAs the night wore on, Harvey and Kandice Child, one of the Church of Safe Injection\u2019s founding members, tag-teamed the slow stream of people picking up supplies, asking them to like the church on Facebook and offering up their services for helping return used needles for disposal. Other volunteers filled paper bags with saline, cotton balls, alcohol wipes, cookers, rubber ties and condoms, logging supplies given out and used needles collected.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get involved and help us do this, I\u2019m really interested in setting up a drug users\u2019 union in Maine,\u201d Harvey told a man picking up supplies. Organizing was less about using drugs and more about advocating for drug users\u2019 health, wellness and safety, he explained, and drug users themselves should be on the front lines of that advocacy.\n\nThe man nodded and tucked Harvey\u2019s business card, identifying him as a \u201cdisciple & acolyte,\u201d into his pocket.\n\n\u201cGod bless,\u201d Child called out as the man receded into the darkness.\n\nAs long as they follow the church\u2019s three basic tenets, the sister branches of the Church of Safe Injection are free to operate as they see fit, and so far, the movement has centered around marrying religious teachings with promoting the rights and safety of drug users.\n\nIn Charles Town, West Virginia, Shannon Hicks, 38, who used IV heroin, cocaine and prescription opioids for nearly two decades, said she felt \u201ccompletely shunned\u201d by her Christian church while she was actively using drugs. \u201cI tried going to church and praying away my addiction,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to do everything that good people did.\u201d When she needed it most, the church abandoned her, and eventually her fellow churchgoers\u2019 hypocrisy ate away at her, she explained.\n\nSo when Hicks saw Harvey wearing a Church of Safe Injection T-shirt at a harm reduction conference this fall, she knew she had to get involved. Days later, she founded her own small branch in Charles Town, which now has around 17 members and a growing Facebook following.\n\nNow when she does peer-to-peer outreach and hands out clean supplies, she tells people about the Church of Safe Injection.\n\n\u201cFor people who are actively using, at first they chuckle and then they really like the idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a church I might actually go to.\u201d\n\nOften, the religious people who are flocking to the church have family members or friends who have been affected by opioids, or have been affected themselves, Harvey said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve seen churches doing enough about this issue.\u201d\n\nLuke, a member of the Church of Safe Injection based in Bangor, Maine, asked not to be identified by his real name because he feared the kind of police crackdown Lewiston was experiencing. \u201cWe\u2019re helping a lot of people and I don\u2019t want folks to be afraid to speak with me,\u201d he said.\n\nLuke works in harm reduction and joined the Church of Safe Injection because he was frustrated that religious people weren\u2019t doing more to help drug users.\n\n\u201cAll people of faith right now are doing is going to funerals,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Will Healthcare Services Decline In Rural North Carolina?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mission-health-rural-hca_us_5c1bbfade4b0535a214bd02f", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "By Taylor Sisk\n\nAs North Carolina\u2019s attorney general deliberates over whether to approve the sale of the nonprofit Mission Health System to for-profit Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA, a citizens group is asking that, if approved, the deal will ensure they have a voice in the future of health care services in their rural communities.\n\nMembers of the citizens group, Sustaining Essential and Rural Community Healthcare, or SEARCH, are worried that the sale will lead to poorer services for patients of Mission Health, which serves 18 mostly rural counties in western North Carolina, in the southern range of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nThe deal with HCA includes the creation of a foundation, Dogwood Health Trust, that will use the proceeds from the proposed $1.5 billion purchase of Mission Health to improve the health and well-being of the communities in those counties.\n\nBut that promise doesn\u2019t ease concerns from residents who want to make sure their views will be heard.\n\n\u201cAll along, we have said that there are two things we want,\u201d said Susan Larson, a member of SEARCH. \u201cWe want our hospitals to be protected, and we want the Dogwood Health Trust to be constituted properly, so that it can indeed serve all 18 counties.\u201d\n\nSEARCH was formed last year when labor and delivery services were discontinued at one of the Mission Health\u2019s hospitals, Blue Ridge Regional, which is located in a town of 2,100 called Spruce Pine and close to the highest peak in Eastern U.S., Mt. Mitchell. Mission Health runs six hospitals, including the flagship facility in the region\u2019s largest city, Asheville (population 90,000).\n\nSEARCH has brought in as a consultant Jay Nixon, former governor of Missouri who, while serving as the state\u2019s attorney general, challenged HCA in courts, charging that the corporation had failed to live up to all of its responsibilities. He brokered a deal that allowed the $1.13 billion sale of Missouri-based nonprofit hospital system, Health Midwest, to HCA if proceeds from the sale would fund two foundations to improve healthcare for the residents in the Kansas City area. HCA later faced a lawsuit from one of the foundations and settled the suit for $160 million in 2017.\n\nNixon\u2019s role for the North Carolina group is to help advocate for an independent health trust that is \u201cgoverned now and in the future by a board and communities that will do what\u2019s best for the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission is a nonprofit and has built up a significant value, obviously, as laid out by the transaction that\u2019s on the table now,\u201d Nixon said.\n\nTax law requires the value of a nonprofit\u2019s assets to remain perpetually nonprofit. When a for-profit healthcare company buys a nonprofit system, one way to keep the proceeds in the nonprofit realm is to create a health care foundation that supports nonprofit work. That\u2019s the plan for the proceeds from the sale of Mission Health\u2019s assets.\n\nHaving reaped the benefits of a nonprofit, Nixon said, Mission Health has a responsibility to taxpayers. \u201cIt\u2019s the community\u2019s money. It\u2019s the state who provided the nonprofit benefits.\u201d\n\nSelecting the best\n\n\u201cPeople in this community have a very long history of feeling that the hospital is ours,\u201d said Jean Hunt, a resident of Yancy County, which is served by Blue Ridge Regional. \u201cWe do not consider that hospital Mission\u2019s. We consider it to be ours.\u201d\n\nBlue Ridge opened in 1955 with significant help from a community fund drive.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is that the foundation isn\u2019t independent,\u201d Hunt said. Thus far, nine members of what is proposed to be a 12- to 15-member Dogwood Health Trust board have been appointed. The majority live in Asheville and eight of the nine have current or previous affiliations with Mission.\n\nThe health trust \u201cvery easily could be the largest per-capita in the country,\u201d said Rowena Buffett Timms, Mission Health\u2019s senior vice president for government and community relations. \u201cWhat you want are the very best that you have to offer in your community to begin setting that up.\u201d\n\nTimms said she has heard the concerns: \u201cPeople went, \u2018Wait a minute, you\u2019ve picked all these people who are or have been on the Mission Health board over the years.\u2019 Absolutely.\u201d Those selected, she said, \u201chave deep pedigree, knowledge of health care, have been intimate with Western North Carolina over the years.\u201d\n\nHunt agreed that such experience is important: \u201cObviously, we need people on board with specific skill sets.\u201d She believes those individuals can also be found in the rural communities.\n\nAs regards Susan Larson\u2019s concern that HCA might close one or more of the regional hospitals,\n\nTo ease concerns about a loss of services after the purchase, HCA\u2019s purchase agreement stipulates that no services will be discontinued for five years, and emergency services must be maintained for 10 \u2013 unless a hospital\u2019s advisory board approves the discontinuance of a service or the sale or closure of a hospital.\n\nThe advisory board at each hospital would have eight members: four appointed by Mission Health, four by HCA.\n\n\u2018Three-comma world\u2019\n\n\u201cI get very concerned about transactions of this nature where you don\u2019t have long-term, ironclad guarantees that the facilities and services will remain open,\u201d Nixon said.\n\n\u201cThe trust, if it could be what they say it\u2019s going to be, could be incredible,\u201d said SEARCH member Risa Larsen. \u201cI love the sound of that trust.\u201d\n\nNixon, too, is big on the potential.\n\n\u201cYou have the opportunity to keep this system as it exists now, which obviously is functioning and is gaining in value,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibrant hospital system.\u201d\n\nBy keeping \u201call the physical assets and the human capital assets\u201d of the existing services and adding the improvements that the foundation promises to deliver, \u201cYou really do have great opportunities.\u201d\n\nThis transaction, Nixon stressed, is \u201cin three-comma world \u2026 a billion dollars. There\u2019s a whole lot of good that can be done if it\u2019s done in a transparent fashion, if it\u2019s done with very solid conflict-of-interest and ethics rules around it and a long-term pipeline of local citizens who understand the particular problems and challenges of the region.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This Is What No One Tells You About Coming Off Antidepressants", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/withdrawing-from-antidepressants_us_5c2a3e2de4b08aaf7a92a7db", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "My relationship with antidepressants began over 20 years ago. Back then, as an anxious teenager crying in my doctor\u2019s office, I had no idea that they would become such an integral part of my life.\n\nI spent a long time wrestling with my need for medication. But you can have as much therapy as you can handle and self-care yourself silly, but for some people, nothing gets rid of that big black cloud \u2014 or at least lifts it enough that you can take a breath \u2014 like a daily pill.\n\nTaking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for clinical depression on a long-term basis wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly, and at various stages I\u2019ve stopped taking them. Maybe my mental health was good and I wanted to see how I got on without the meds. At other times, I succumbed to the stigma and bowed to the pressure inflicted \u2014 be it intentional or not \u2014 by people who proudly declared, \u201cI had depression and got through it without medication!\u201d\n\nThere are a ton of other reasons someone might quit their antidepressants, for example if they couldn\u2019t handle the side effects (commonly reported ones include decreased libido, headaches, insomnia, drowsiness, or simply not feeling like yourself), didn\u2019t think they were working (up to a third of people have treatment-resistant, or refractory, depression), or simply struggled to meet the expense of long-term meds.\n\nAfter several rounds of trial and error, I\u2019ve accepted them as part of my life, and an essential component in my self-care toolkit.\n\nEach time, I ended up back on the medication anyway. Finally, after several rounds of trial and error, I\u2019ve accepted them as part of my life, and an essential component in my self-care toolkit. I also know a few things about what happens when you stop taking them.\n\nThis is an aspect of taking antidepressants I was never told about, despite seeing numerous doctors and working my way through various types of SSRIs. Yes, it\u2019s all there in the small print inside the pill packet, but small print was the last thing I wanted to deal with when simply getting out of bed in the morning was my own personal Everest.\n\nWhat happens when you stop taking antidepressants is commonly referred to as \u201cwithdrawal\u201d symptoms, but this isn\u2019t entirely accurate, according to Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, and author of The Power of Different.\n\n\u201cWithdrawal is a craving for a drug, plus physical symptoms,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhat happens when you stop an antidepressant is known as a discontinuation syndrome, due to the sudden loss of serotonin and/or norepinephrine that had been boosted in the brain by the medication.\u201d\n\nThe first time I stopped taking antidepressants, I followed my doctor\u2019s advice. Over six weeks, I gradually reduced my dose (known as tapering). Initially, I didn\u2019t feel great, but I didn\u2019t feel lousy, either. I had a bit of a headache, nausea, insomnia, and zero energy. A few weeks after stopping my meds completely, I noticed that my anxiety had ramped up, and my low days were more frequent than they had been in a long time. I figured this was an adjustment period, but I was wrong. I was relapsing into depression.\n\nThree months later, I was back on my meds.\n\nIt turns out that some symptoms of discontinuation syndrome \u2014 aside from physical symptoms not commonly found in depression, such as dizziness, flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches, pains, nausea, and abnormal sensations \u2014 can resemble a relapse. However, discontinuation symptoms typically appear very soon after stopping the meds or reducing the dose, whereas relapse symptoms develop later and more gradually.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re more likely to experience discontinuation symptoms if you\u2019ve been taking a certain class of antidepressant, such as an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or a shorter-acting SSRI, like paroxetine (Paxil) or sertraline (Zoloft).\n\nDr. Saltz says tapering slowly makes discontinuation syndrome far less likely to happen, but every time I\u2019ve stopped or reduced my meds through tapering, I\u2019ve still experienced symptoms of discontinuation to some extent.\n\nAnd then there was the time I just ... stopped. No tapering. In my defense, it wasn\u2019t intentional. I was traveling to France with my two young children. I had packed everything we needed for our two-week vacation. Our cases bulged with swimwear, sandals, books, and all manner of things to keep the little people entertained. It wasn\u2019t until I started to unpack, 1,200 miles from home, that I realized something vital was missing from my wash bag.\n\nI arrived home feeling as if all the steps forward I took while I was on medication had been erased from my history; I had taken an enormous leap backward.\n\nSome might say everything\u2019s easier when the out-of-office is turned on and the sun is shining. This doesn\u2019t apply to a sudden stopping of antidepressants. And there was nothing I could do about it but power on through.\n\nThe next week was a blur. I remember crazy dreams, feelings of despair, fear and paranoia, anxiety, tremors, dizziness, and the strangest sensations I\u2019ve ever experienced. I call them \u201cbrain zaps\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re like tiny electric shocks in my brain. I\u2019d had them to a lesser extent during previous (planned) periods of tapering, but this time round they were as unrelenting as the French Riviera midday sun.\n\nApparently, these are caused by an abrupt change in the level of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that attach to receptors on the nerve cells) in the brain, and they\u2019re generally not medically dangerous. But they\u2019re uncomfortable as hell.\n\nI arrived home feeling as if all the steps forward I took while I was on medication had been erased from my history; I had taken an enormous leap backward. I was back to where I started.\n\nI learned an important lesson after that trip. I\u2019ve never forgotten to pack my meds since.\n\nHere\u2019s the main thing I know about coming off antidepressants: it\u2019s a complex process, and it affects everyone differently. It\u2019s up to you when \u2014 or if \u2014 to stop taking antidepressants, but never do it without speaking to your doctor first. In my experience, tapering makes it bearable; stopping suddenly is never going to go well. Don\u2019t quit your meds unless you feel confident that your mental health is good, that you\u2019re functioning well, and that you have the tools and support system to cope with any negative thoughts that might crop up. It\u2019s not a good idea to quit while you\u2019re feeling stressed or going through a major life change, or if you\u2019re only doing it to keep other people happy (perhaps you should quit those people, instead of the meds).\n\nAlso, be aware of the difference between discontinuation syndrome and relapse. And try to stay open-minded, whatever path you take. Some people only need to take antidepressants for a few months; while others do so for several years.\n\nFinally, always, always, remember to pack your pills for your vacation."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Do You Really Know What's In Your Tampons?

Kimberly-Clark, Kotex\u2019s parent company, said in a press release it received \u201ca small number of reports of infections, vaginal irritation, localized vaginal injury, and other symptoms\u201d and that in some cases consumers had to seek medical attention \u201cto remove tampon pieces left in the body.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there is no federal or state law requiring Kotex, or any other menstrual hygiene company, to share the ingredients \u2014 including the chemicals \u2014 that make up its products. This is a problem, says Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic member of the New York state Assembly. When tampons are falling apart inside people\u2019s bodies, she told HuffPost, doctors should be able to know how to treat these patients. But they\u2019ll struggle to do it if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the problem, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd who knows what the long-term effects are?\u201d Rosenthal asked in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s case in point for why we need ingredient labeling on products people put inside their body.\u201d\n\nRosenthal is sponsoring legislation in New York to require ingredient labeling on the packaging of all menstrual products sold in the state. The Assembly is expected to consider the bill in 2019; if it passes, it will be the first law of its kind in the United States.\n\nManufacturers might list some, but not all, ingredients on feminine hygiene packaging or on their products\u2019 websites.\n\nIn a letter to Kimberly-Clark, the Assembly member asked the company to \u201cpublicly disclose the chemicals present in these products so that menstruators can work with their health care providers to properly manage risks associated with exposure.\u201d She has yet to receive a response.\n\nBrett Carlsen via Getty Images Linda Rosenthal of the New York state Assembly wants to make it mandatory for tampon companies to disclose the ingredients they use in their products.\n\nRosenthal isn\u2019t alone in her fight. In 2017, for example, the Menstrual Products Right to Know Act was introduced in Congress, though it later stalled.\n\n\u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said. She fears these products contains an array of chemicals that \u201cmore and more people are becoming sensitive to.\u201d\n\nA recent study commissioned by the organization Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth detected chemicals like carbon disulfide, a known reproductive toxin, and methylene chloride, a potential occupational carcinogen, in popular tampon brands. These ingredients are not disclosed on product packaging. (WVE, it should be noted, partners with two menstrual product brands, Seventh Generation and Natracare, both of which appeared free of chemicals in the testing.)\n\nThis is not the only study on menstrual products and potential contaminants, but research into the topic is limited. There are also conflicting opinions on what is considered \u201csafe\u201d when it comes to the levels of chemicals in these products. Trace amounts of dioxin, a chemical that has been associated with endometriosis, have been deemed \u201csafe\u201d by the Food and Drug Administration, The New York Times reported in 2017. Manufacturers are required to assess the dioxin levels in their products on their own, and then provide the FDA with their results.\n\nSome experts worry that the harmfulness of dioxin could be greater than is widely assumed. Carolyn Nygaard, a naturopathic physician, told The Guardian in 2016 that she is unsure of the chemical\u2019s effects on women\u2019s health over time, and isn\u2019t confident the FDA considers this. Women menstruate for up to 40 years, Nygaard told The Guardian, wearing up to 20 tampons once a month, 13 times a year. \u201cSo there is the potential to have cumulative effects from that,\u201d she said. The vaginal membrane is more absorptive than skin on other parts of the body, which raises specific concerns around chemicals like dioxin in products meant to be inserted vaginally, the publication noted.\n\nPhotographyFirm via Getty Images \u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said.\n\nRosenthal is a pioneer in fronting legislation for fair treatment of people who menstruate.\n\nIn March 2018, she introduced the Total Access to Menstrual Products Act to the Assembly. The TAMP Act would require all female-designated bathrooms in the state of New York to provide hygiene products at no cost.\n\n\u201cToilet paper is assumed in every bathroom,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cWhy should there not be products to help half the population deal with their biological function? It doesn\u2019t make sense. If you can expect toilet paper, you should be able to expect menstrual products.\u201d\n\nRosenthal also helped spearhead a bill that would require state correctional facilities to provide incarcerated people with menstrual products at no cost. The bill passed.\n\nUltimately, Rosenthal said, laws relating to menstrual health will help to reduce the stigma and shame that surrounds the topic.\n\nThe fight for these types of legal actions underscores how desperately we need more women in power, Rosenthal added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

He has joked to colleagues that he has more influence with Mr. Trump during winter months because he is able to hitch a ride on Air Force One during the president\u2019s flights down to Mar-a-Lago, which is several miles from Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s own $2.3 million waterfront condo in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nHe used that access to argue to Mr. Trump that the United States has never had more leverage to extract structural reforms on intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from American companies and cybercrime. But while Mr. Trump has jumped at the chance to claim victory in changing China\u2019s ways, experts say that what Mr. Lighthizer is demanding would require significant shifts in how Beijing\u2019s central government and its manufacturing sector coordinate their activities, and that might simply not be possible in the short term.\n\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Mr. Scissors said.\n\nThose who know Mr. Lighthizer say he will try to force concessions through a combination of pressure tactics, like tariffs, and public condemnation.

Another longtime Biden operative, Joshua Alcorn, has been paid by Mr. Biden\u2019s PAC while serving as an executive at the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children.\n\nThe top compensation, as far as can be determined from Internal Revenue Service records, belongs to Gregory C. Simon, who was projected in a tax exemption application to receive $552,500 a year to run the cancer initiative. Mr. Biden selected Mr. Simon in the final year of the Obama administration to lead the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force for less than 40 percent of that amount.\n\nImage Gregory C. Simon runs the Biden Cancer Initiative. Credit Matt Low\n\nMr. Biden declined through his spokesman to be interviewed about his post-vice-presidency.

Whether all the groups could sustain operations is unclear, given that Mr. Biden could face pressure to suspend fund-raising to avoid improper influence.\n\nDuring the 2018 cycle, Mr. Biden maintained visibility with campaign visits to 24 states and at least 135 other speaking engagements, giving him a platform whenever he wanted. At a book-related talk in Missoula, Mont., in early December, he fueled coast-to-coast speculation about his plans by declaring himself \u201cthe most qualified person in the country to be president.\u201d\n\nSources of Wealth\n\nMr. Biden has long been self-deprecating about his relative lack of wealth, compared with some politicians.

Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.\n\nDefining an institution\u2019s role\n\nFounded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering was the first hospital in the country devoted exclusively to treating cancer. Its benefactors have included some of the wealthiest families in America, from the Astors and Rockefellers in its early years to the Kochs today.\n\nIt now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.\n\nAs a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.\n\nBut some on the hospital\u2019s board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center\u2019s chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were \u201clying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Treatment Gap: In Rehab, \u2018Two Warring Factions\u2019: Abstinence vs. Medication", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit \u2014 an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry\u2019s role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Personal Health: Hearing Loss Threatens Mind, Life and Limb", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/well/live/hearing-loss-threatens-mind-life-and-limb.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-02 09:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "About 85 percent of those with hearing loss are untreated, Dr. Lin said. For older adults alone, this increased health care costs by 46 percent over a period of 10 years, compared with costs incurred by those without hearing loss, the authors reported in November in JAMA Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nOne of the authors, Jennifer A. Deal, an epidemiologist and gerontologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while \u201chearing loss itself is not very expensive, the effect of hearing loss on everything else is expensive.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, people tend to wait much too long to get their hearing tested and treated with hearing aids, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to treat hearing loss, Dr. Lin told me.\n\nAge-related hearing loss comes on really slowly, making it harder for people to know when to take it seriously, he said. He cited two good clues to when to get your hearing tested: Family members or close friends say you should, or you notice that you often mishear or don\u2019t know what others are saying.\n\nBut even when people are tested and spend thousands of dollars to purchase needed hearing aids, the devices often sit in a drawer. People may complain that the sound quality is poor, too static-y or otherwise annoying, and that the aids merely amplify all sound, making it still hard to hear in a noisy environment. All aids are not created equal, Dr. Lin said, and even expensive, properly fitted aids can require multiple adjustments. Some people give up too readily to get the best results.\n\n\u201cUnrealistic expectations are a big part of this problem,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting on a pair of glasses that immediately enables you to see clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing loss is not fixed as easily as eyesight. The brain needs time \u2014 a good month or two \u2014 to adjust to hearing aids. And the earlier hearing loss is treated, the easier it is for the brain to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe new studies give ample cause for taking hearing loss seriously. Consider, for example, the link to dementia. People who can\u2019t hear well often become socially isolated and deprived of stimuli that keep the brain cognitively engaged. As input lessens, so does brain function."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The New Health Care: Congratulations on the Promotion.

Perhaps the main reason I\u2019ve been promoted to that rank is that I\u2019ve been productive in obtaining large federal grants. Successfully completing each project, then getting that research published in high-profile journals, is what allows me to continue to get more funding.\n\nA National Institutes of Health regulation sets a \u201csignificant financial interest\u201d as any amount over $5,000. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that being given thousands of dollars could influence your thinking about research or medicine. But let\u2019s put things in perspective. Many scientists have been awarded millions of dollars in grant funding. This is incredibly valuable not only to them but also to their employers. Journals and gran t funders like to see eye-catching work. It would be silly not to think that this might also subtly influence thinking and actions. In my own work, I do my best to remain conscious of these subtle forces and how they may operate, but it\u2019s a continuing battle.\n\nGetting positive results, or successfully completing projects, can sometimes feel like the only way to achieve success in research careers. Just as those drivers can lead people to publish those results, it can also nudge them not to publish null ones.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I\u2019ve been acutely aware of concerns that relationships between formula companies and the American Academy of Pediatrics might be influencing policies on feeding infants. But biases can occur even without direct financial contributions.\n\nIf an organization has spent decades recommending low-fat diets, it can be hard for that group to acknowledge the potential benefits of a low-carb diet (and vice versa).
