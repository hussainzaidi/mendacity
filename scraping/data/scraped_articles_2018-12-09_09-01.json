At this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no Russian Collusion. There is nothing impeachable here.\" @GeraldoRivera Time for the Witch Hunt to END! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2018\n\nThe President has a long record of disregarding evidence that contradicts his preferred version of events. And Trump has mounted a long campaign to discredit the special counsel, apparently seeking to devalue any eventual conclusions that are critical of his conduct.\n\nBut the deepening record of the Mueller investigation is raising the possibility that Trump's talent in creating alternative realities is facing its stiffest test yet.\n\nNew and damaging information for the White House comes at a time when every move by Mueller appears to bring his investigation deeper into the White House and Trump's inner circle, and shows it has expanded well beyond what may or may not have happened in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSo the President has every reason to change the subject.\n\nKelly's departure has long been expected given an apparently fractious relationship with the President and his diminishing influence in a riotous White House he once tried to tame with military-style discipline.\n\n\"I appreciate his service very much,\" Trump said, of a respected retired general who also served as his first homeland security secretary.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Saturday that Trump was in talks with Nick Ayers, who current serves as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, to succeed Kelly. But the elevation of Ayers is not certain, as he is looking to move his young family back to Georgia and may only want to do the job in the short term.\n\nTrump also took time to tweet about violence in France that has rocked the Macron government and caused the cancellation of fuel tax increases designed to wean consumers off fossil fuels that cause global warming.\n\n\"Very sad day & night in Paris. Maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes?\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nDeepening jeopardy\n\nTaunting a fellow world leader who was once a friend but has recently criticized the President's nationalistic worldview might be a pleasant diversion for Trump, but cannot change the reality of the widening special counsel probe.\n\nMueller is clearly now looking not just at allegations of possible cooperation of Trump associates with Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, but at possible obstruction of justice even after the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That much became clear when CNN reported on Friday that the special counsel has spoken to Kelly in recent months. The chief of staff did not even take the job until July 2017.\n\nA series of filings and court action this week by Mueller, federal prosecutors and attorneys for the President's former lawyer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn appeared to significantly sharpen the threats facing Trump and key associates.\n\nNone of the documents amount to criminal action against the President himself. But they tell an indirect tale of allegedly questionable behavior by the then-GOP nominee.\n\nFor the first time, prosecutors said Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump, which broke campaign finance laws.\n\nMueller also drew a link between Trump's business interests and the Russian election meddling effort. He pointed out that work on a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project that continued until deep into the campaign in June 2016 -- and which Cohen lied about -- came \"at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nMueller also confirmed that he has benefited from substantial cooperation from Cohen and Flynn, and that he has documentary evidence in addition to testimony from witnesses. This raises the likelihood that he has built a comprehensive picture into what went on in the Trump campaign, the transition and in the White House, even though he is yet to reveal everything publicly in heavily redacted documents.\n\nTrump and his legal team insist, however, that the President is in the clear.\n\n\"When you look at what was revealed today, there's nothing that links the President to collusion with the Russians, so maybe they should fold up their tent, give a report to the Justice Department and go home,\" Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Pam Brown on Friday.\n\nGiuliani also said the President never told Cohen to pay women who claimed affairs with him, adding that such payments would not count as a campaign contribution.\n\nThe depth of the President's legal and political difficulties will only become clear when Mueller files a final report -- and Trump's team will have the chance to challenge his findings and make their defense. But it's increasingly looking like the President's denials and distractions are failing to keep up with the special counsel's accelerating pace."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "SE Cupp: Is Trump even reading what I'm reading?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/BrB2AlLPYYU/se-cupp-monologue-trump-mueller-court-filings-unfiltered-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "CNN's SE Cupp sifts through the trio of court filings, two from the special counsel's office and one from the Southern District of New York, which suggest special counsel Robert Mueller has substantial evidence to back up his accusations."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Dean: Congress will have 'little choice' but to begin impeachment", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Iymj2uQ3O9Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former Nixon White House lawyer John Dean said he thinks Congress will have \"little choice\" but to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump following a Friday evening court filing involving Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\n\"I think what this totality of today's filings show that the House is going to have little choice, the way this is going, other than to start impeachment proceedings,\" Dean, a CNN contributor, said Friday on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\"\n\nDean, who served time in prison for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, was discussing a sentencing memo from the Manhattan US attorney's office, which was the first time prosecutors have said Cohen acted at the direction of Trump when the former fixer made payments to silence women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump prior to his time running for office.\n\nTrump has denied the affairs and has not been accused of any crimes related to the payments.\n\nBut when Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations connected to the payments as well as other charges, he stated in court that he had been directed by Trump.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump calls for Mueller probe to end", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/8O5tdUNerJc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Saturday that court filings in the Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen cases showed no collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\n\"We're very happy with what we're reading because there was no collusion whatsoever,\" Trump told reporters Saturday at the White House before boarding Marine One for the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump told reporters he has not read the court filings, which detail alleged lies Cohen and Manafort told publicly and to investigators.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes after being charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors.

None of the material in this series may be reproduced without an explicit credit to CNN and the Pulitzer Center.\n\nTokyo (CNN) One of the first concepts Linh Nguyen learned while studying Japanese was \"uchi-soto.\"\n\nIt refers to the practice of categorizing people into one of two groups -- insiders or outsiders. Family, friends and close acquaintances are insiders, referred to as \"uchi,\" while \"soto\" is for those relegated to the periphery.\n\nThe second type, which would have no renewal limit, is aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. Both visas require proficiency in Japanese.\n\nThe first, renewable for up to 5 years, would cover semi-qualified, blue-collar workers, and is aimed at plugging gaps in areas such as care-giving and manufacturing.\n\nA proposed amendment to the immigration law, if passed, will create two new visas for foreign workers.\n\nFor this Japan-obsessed student in Vietnam, it felt like a warning: she could be about to enter a deeply closed society that would always consider her an outsider.\n\nUltimately, though, that was not Nguyen's experience. The 25-year-old discovered that Japan was slowly changing.\n\nAs Japan's population gets older and smaller, the government is struggling to balance its own deeply conservative views on immigration with the need for new and younger workers. Public opinion is on the side of change. Despite perceptions of xenophobia, a 2018 Pew survey revealed that 59% of Japanese believed immigrants would actually make the country stronger.\n\nThis week, Japanese lawmakers approved a policy change proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that will create new visa categories to allow an estimated 340,000 foreign workers to take both high-skilled and low-wage jobs in Japan over the next five years.\n\nWhile this represents a major shift in Japan's approach to immigration, many experts argue it doesn't go far enough.\n\nVietnamese student Linh Nyugen came to Japan to pursue higher education.\n\nShrinking nation\n\nJapan is already a \"super-aged\" nation -- meaning that more than 20% of its population is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017, a record low since official records began in 1899, while an increase in deaths accelerated the population decline.\n\nThe decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an increasingly elderly population in need of healthcare and pensions.\n\nBut Japan isn't the only country with such a problem.\n\nSingapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries. Germany is a also a \"super-aged\" nation. And by 2030 , the US, UK,Singapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries.\n\nIf Abe is to prevent Japan's population from dipping below 100 million by 2060 , he will need to provide migrants good reasons to choose the country, says Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nA 2015 Pew survey exploring how people in Asia-Pacific see each other revealed that a median of 71% of people in the region held a favorable view of Japan, with positive views exceeding negative sentiment by more than five-to-one.\n\nNguyen points to Japan's solid environmental practices and strong safety record as appealing factors.\n\nBut the country's historic failure to integrate previous waves of foreign workers raises questions as to why migrants would choose to come to Japan.\n\nFaced with labor shortages in the 1990s Japan revised its immigration rules to offer long-term, renewable visas to the descendants of Japanese immigrants who had moved to Latin American after World War II.\n\nBut when the economy slumped in 2008, the government urged those same immigrants to return to Brazil and the other Latin American nations where they had moved from.\n\n\"Japan treats its foreign workers like Kleenex,\" says Jeff Kingston, a Japanese studies professor at Temple University. \"They have a use-it, toss-it mentality.\"\n\nOther options nearby\n\nSingapore has a very different track record. Since independence in 1965, the small South-east Asian city state has built a diverse society by taking in large numbers of immigrants from neighboring Asian countries.\n\nToday, foreigners make up more than one-third of Singapore's labor force , though conditions are challenging for low-skilled laborers and numerous abuses exist.\n\nOn its website , the Singapore government states that non-resident foreigners do jobs Singaporeans don't want, and do not compete with locals for high-paying professional or managerial jobs. \"They are here to help build our homes, keep our roads clean, and make our lives just a little more comfortable,\" the website says.\n\nThe new visa will allow blue collar workers to stay in Japan for up to five years.\n\nExperts argue that Japan lags behind other industrialized countries in extolling the benefits of immigration to its domestic population. \"The government needs to sell how these people contribute to pensions and economic growth,\" Kingston says.\n\nAs immigration policy has failed to keep up with demand, temporary fixes have plugged the gap. Foreigners on student visas, for example, can work up to 28 hours per week -- but Japan has been accused of using students to fill labor shortages.\n\nis one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan. In 2018, the number of foreign residents reached Nguyen, who is studying for a masters degree,is one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan. In 2018, the number of foreign residents reached a record high of 2.5 million , although that's still only 2% of Japan's total population.\n\nOn a bustling Tokyo side street is the office of Inbound Japan, a concierge service and cultural interpreter for foreign students struggling to navigate living and working in Japan.\n\nYusuke Furumi at work in the Inbound Japan office with his Vietnamese colleague, Angel Phan.\n\nFive years ago, Inbound Japan started providing foreign students with cheap dorm rooms. Its range of services grew as people wanted help getting phone contracts, setting up bank accounts, going to hospital and finding part-time jobs.\n\nYusuke Furumi, an employee there, hopes Japan can gradually become more open to the idea of working alongside foreigners, and make it easier for them to stay and contribute to the economy and society.\n\nEnter the outback\n\nIn the small town of Muroto, in southeastern Japan, foreigners on the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) have come to the rescue.\n\nOnce a booming fishing port, today Muroto has a graying community. Vacant houses pockmark the area where the town's bars once thrived. Many of the town's public facilities such as hospitals and elementary schools have shut down.\n\nSo when Mie Kinoshita was unable to find a mechanic to work in her car dealership in 2017, she decided to outsource her needs -- and applied to receive technical interns from the Philippines.\n\nJohn Riggs Ancino is shadowing Masahiro Maeda.\n\nThe scheme has faced frequent criticism since its establishment in 1993. In theory, the TITP allows low-skilled workers to come to Japan to learn technical skills they can later take back to their home countries. But opponents of the program allege it has been used as a loophole to plug gaps in the domestic labor market. Trainees, meanwhile, have reported frequent instances of workplace abuse and bullying.\n\nKinoshita was aware of the horror stories. To help create a more welcoming environment, she bought a house for her staff. And while they presently only make minimum wage, which is 762 yen ($6.70) an hour in Muroto, she hopes to increase their wages as their skills grow.\n\nKinoshita's employees John Riggs Ancino and Marvin Curilan, arrived in Muroto from the Philippines two months ago. On arrival in Japan, the pair received several weeks of Japanese language and culture lessons.\n\n\"I'd like to stay here,\" says Riggs Ancino, who worked in a tire repair shop back home. \"It would be great if I could build a family in Japan.\"\n\nTheir Japanese colleagues also appreciate the newcomers.\n\n\"It's still hard for us to understand one another, but I've been working on my English skills,\" says Masahiro Maeda, a mechanic in his late 50s. \"I'd like them to stay.\"\n\nMasoto Yasuda, a mechanic in his late 30s, adds: \"I want to go to the Philippines now. It hadn't really crossed my mind before I met them.\"\n\nBoth local and foreign workers at the car dealership said they hoped the immigrants could stay in Japan.\n\nUnder the current rules, technical trainees can only work in Japan for five years.\n\nAbe's proposals, however, would allow them to apply for an additional five years. But there's a catch. To do so they would have to apply from their home countries, denying them the right to seek permanent residency -- which requires 10 years of continuous living in Japan.\n\nExperts fear terms like this may run through many of Abe's new proposals, helping more blue collars workers come to Japan -- but preventing them from settling long term.\n\nJapan's work culture\n\nWhile Japan might be coming around to the appeal of foreigner workers, not all of the newcomers are keen on Japanese work culture.\n\nSamir Levi came to Japan from Nepal four years ago, after his older brother did a six-week cultural exchange in Tokyo. Levi, 26, worked a part-time job as a dishwasher in a ramen shop and the graveyard shift at a convenience store, before becoming a recruiter for a Japanese language school in the capital.\n\nHe has absorbed the Japanese habits of gently bobbing the head in agreement and executing a well-timed farewell bow. \"I blend in here now,\" he says. \"I've become Japanese in some ways.\"\n\nLevi meets up with friends in Shin-Okubo, an area of Tokyo split along gastronomical lines.\n\nBut the longer Levi lives in Japan, the less he wants to stay. Now a salary man, Levi clocks long hours -- just like locals. Earlier this year, the government limited overtime to 100 hours per month, but Levi yearns for better options.\n\nNow he wants to move to the US or Australia.\n\nNguyen, too, has integrated into Japan and has a mix of local and migrant friends. But she is wary of committing to Japan's long working hours and culture of heavy out-of-office drinking with colleagues, known as \"nomikai.\"\n\nShe would stay in Japan, she says, if she could bring her parents to live with her. Failing that, she might move to Australia or Canada or go back to Vietnam.\n\n\"I haven't lost my fascination with Japan yet,\" Nyugen says. \"But perhaps Japan may need to realize that it needs foreigners as opposed to the other way around.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'Yellow vest' protests turn violent in Paris", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/sn3kpzMGfnI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Paris (CNN) French police clashed Saturday in Paris with protesters staging a fourth weekend of \"gilets jaunes,\" or \"yellow vest,\" demonstrations against the government of President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nRubber bullets found on the Avenue de Friedland on Saturday in Paris.\n\nOfficers fired rubber bullets and hundreds of canisters of tear gas at the demonstrators, some of whom had set vehicles on fire.\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said 135 people were wounded in Saturday's protests across France.\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, 1,723 people were taken in for questioning and 1,220 were taken into custody.\n\nTwo photographers from the newspaper Le Parisien were hit by projectiles.

But the 80-year old had another job: he was 'chairman of the board' of Italy's most powerful mafia group -- the 'Ndrangheta.\n\nThis week, police in four European countries carried out raids on the 'Ndrangheta's sprawling empire of money-laundering and drug-trafficking, arresting 90 people. They described \"Operation Pollino\" -- two years in the making - as a \"decisive strike against one of the most powerful Italian criminal networks in the world.\"\n\nThe operation took place the day after the alleged head, or \"godfather,\" of the Sicilian mafia, known as Cosa Nostra, was arrested with 46 other people in the Palermo region of Italy on mafia charges.\n\nBut Oppedisano, now in jail after being arrested eight years ago , may not be impressed. The 'Ndrangheta has been the target of raids and even US Treasury sanctions for well over a decade. And yet it has entrenched its dominance of the cocaine trade, forging links with organized crime groups in Latin America, New York, Turkey and Albania.\n\nMafia watchers estimate its turnover is probably in the range of about $60 billion a year -- similar to the GDP of Croatia or Bulgaria. And it may control as much as 80% of the cocaine entering Europe.\n\nA low profile\n\nIn the early 1990s, Italian authorities went after the Cosa Nostra in Sicily following the killing of two key prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.

It kept a low profile but steadily expanded its activities from its stronghold in the mountain villages of Calabria, the \"toe\" of southern Italy.\n\nCecilia Anesi, an investigative journalist who has spent time in the group's heartlands, says a new generation of leaders wanted to find ways to invest proceeds from kidnapping and protection. The answer was cocaine.\n\nSettimino Mineo, jeweller and new head of the Sicilian mafia, is escorted by carabinieri as he leaves a police station following his arrest this week.\n\nItalian court documents describe drug trafficking as \"the gold mine the 'Ndrangheta uses to then invest in the legal economy in Italy and abroad.\"\n\nThe group combined its stubborn rural origins with a flair for innovation. Antonio Nicaso, who has published some 30 books about organized crime including several about the 'Ndrangheta, says it forged ties with drug producers and distributors throughout Latin America: in Peru, Colombia, Guyana and Brazil.\n\nNicaso told CNN it came to control all the major trafficking routes, including ports in Brazil and West Africa. It also established a presence in European ports such as Antwerp and Rotterdam. A front company in Colombia hid huge amounts of cocaine in charcoal exports to Europe; another did the same but with timber from Guyana.\n\nThat Italian place\n\nA US diplomatic cable in 2008 concluded the 'Ndrangheta belied its origins in an Italian backwater, \"maintaining bank accounts in Monte Carlo and Milan and transplanting operatives to Colombia, Spain, Germany, the Balkans, Canada and Australia.\"\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta laundered the rapidly growing proceeds through investments in tourism on the French Riviera, restaurants and real estate in Spain, public contracts in northern Italy. And it turned to the large Calabrian diaspora across Europe (and especially in Germany) to expand.\n\nThe German pizzeria where police arrested an alleged member of the Italian 'Ndrangheta mafia organization on Wednesday.\n\nExploiting family ties, the clans used Italian bistros and cafes from Dusseldorf to south London as fronts for money-laundering operations and the distribution of narcotics. In this week's raids alone, police seized 4,000 kilograms of cocaine and 140 kilos of ecstasy pills, plus large sums of cash.\n\nCecilia Alesi says investigators have evidence that an ice cream parlor in the German town of Bruggen was used to launder money. And a pizza restaurant near Cologne became a logistical base, money laundering hub and place from which to organize Latin American drug shipments. Restaurants in two Dutch villages played a similar role.\n\nEvery clod of earth\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta began life in the 19th century as rural brigands, taking its name from the Greek word for heroism. Calabria was and remains perfect mafia territory: an unforgiving landscape dominated by the Aspromonte (or Rough Mountains). Remote, secretive and one of the poorest regions in Europe, it is hostile to any form of state authority.\n\nToday, the region is dominated by a few historic families -- like the Pelle, Romeo and Giorgi. The 'Ndrangheta's \"spiritual\" home is the town of San Luca, but different families control municipalities or \"mandamenti.\" In the words of one Italian prosecutor, they control \"every clod of earth\" in southern Calabria.\n\nThe group has not been without internal vendettas. A long-running feud between two families, the Nirta-Strangio and Pelle-Vottari, culminated in an attack on a pizzeria in Duisburg, Germany, in 2007 -- when six young men of the Pelle clan were gunned down.\n\nA boy lays a letter in front of the Italian restaurant \"Da Bruno\" in 2007, after six members of the Pelle clan were shot dead.\n\nHauser says the unwanted spotlight prompted the 'Ndrangheta to form a provincia, a sort of board of directors for settling disputes and approving new affiliations. The elderly Oppedisano may have become its \"chairman\" because he was a consensus figure.\n\nFamily links are often reinforced through marriage, and blood ties have made the 'Ndrangheta more difficult to break down than other mafia groups. Hauser says that within the 'Ndrangheta \"it's almost impossible to distinguish the blood family from the criminal family. On top of that, information within the organization is shared gradually, according to a strict hierarchy.\"\n\nWhile thousands of members of the Cosa Nostra became informants, just a few dozen 'Ndrangheta members have turned -- and none among the top echelon, says Nicaso. The code of silence, or \"omerta,\" remains as powerful as ever. Those who step out of line, as did the group's \"representative\" in northern Italy back in 2008, don't last long.\n\nUS diplomats reported in 2009 that \"most of the politicians we met with on a recent visit [to Calabria] were fatalistic, of the opinion that there was little that could be done to stop the region's downward economic spiral or the stranglehold of the 'Ndrangheta.\"\n\nThe chameleon\n\nWaves of arrests over the last decade has certainly disrupted the group. A sweep in 2010 netted some 300 arrests (including of several policemen).\n\nNicaso says the creation of a Joint Investigation Team across Europe two years ago was a big step forward -- joining the dots of 'Ndrangheta activity across borders through intelligence-sharing.\n\nInvestigators also took advantage of new technology -- planting software in the cell phone of Domenico Pelle, allegedly a senior lieutenant in the organization (even at the age of 27), who was arrested this week. It secretly recorded not only his conversations but even ambient audio, according to reporter Cecilia Anesi.\n\nEU agency Eurojust says this week's operation was the \"biggest of its kind to date in Europe.\"\n\nThose are the positives. But Oxford University researcher Zora Hauser told CNN this operation won't hinder the group's ability to function.\n\n\"It has arguably weakened some families, but one of the strengths of the 'Ndrangheta is that clans benefit from a high level of autonomy. The weakening of one family can easily translate into the strengthening of another.\"\n\nOne Italian police official has described the group as like a chameleon, changing the way it works but always retaining its invisible base in the Calabrian mountains. It has thoroughly penetrated local politics and is capable of turning municipal elections in favor of one candidate or another. It provided prostitutes for one judge. It buys, threatens or liquidates anyone who challenges it.\n\nHauser says that Mafia families \"are established in virtually every city in Calabria and control the entire spectrum of legal and illegal economic activities: waste disposal, construction, renewable energy, agriculture, tourism, drug and weapon trafficking and most recently the refugee business.\"\n\nNicaso says this week's raids have \"scratched the surface. We need 10 of them, one after another, to make a real impact on the 'Ndrangheta.\"\n\nInvestigative journalist Cecilia Anesi agrees. She says the 'Ndrangheta has perfected the art of penetrating every aspect of life in Calabria while sub-contracting much of the dirty work of moving drugs to narco-freelancers across Europe -- especially Albanian and Turkish gangs.\n\nAfter these latest raids, Anesi says \"the families will have to reorganize, but in a couple of weeks they will be back.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Migrants risk death at sea to reach UK", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/jGmtCzW5dos/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Calais, France (CNN) Since the migrant crisis exploded in the summer of 2015, thousands have perished trying to cross the Mediterranean, with the death of three-year-old Syrian Alan Kurdi, whose body washed up on a Turkish beach, shocking the world.\n\nBut this year, more and more refugees are trying to cross a different stretch of water, the English Channel, one of the busiest shipping lanes on the planet, in hopelessly inadequate boats.\n\nUK government figures show that more than 100 migrants have set out in small boats from France and made it into British waters since November 2. The French coastguard says it is now rescuing migrants from the English Channel every day.\n\nOn the outskirts of Dunkirk, northern France, hundreds of migrants, mainly Iranians but also Iraqi Kurds, sleep rough in a wood on a nature reserve, sandwiched between a lake on one side and a supermarket on the other.\n\nThe Iranian migrants say a combination of economic hardship and political persecution is driving them here in ever greater numbers. Their aim? To reach the UK, where they believe it will be easier to claim asylum. And they are hoping to get there soon, before Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union on March 29, 2019.\n\nHadi, a 32-year-old Iranian who began his journey four years ago, says that after the New Year, \"once the UK has left Europe,\" they expect the crossing to get harder, \"with more policemen.\"\n\nUntil now, migrants sought to smuggle themselves aboard the trucks that regularly cross the Channel on ferries or by rail. But this, they say, has become more expensive, with people-smugglers charging thousands of euros for each attempt.\n\nIranian migrants traveling in a dinghy are picked up by a British lifeboat and French Maritime Police.\n\nAhmed, who's been living for more than two and a half years in the \"jungle,\" a term he uses to refer to a camp in the woods, says dinghies are better. There are, he says, \"no controls\" and it is cheaper. But his efforts so far have been unsuccessful.\n\nOnce, he says, he bought a dinghy in Paris, then tried to launch it from a beach near Calais. But the motor's blade got caught in the sand and he had to run from the police who had followed him onto the beach. Another time, he says, he couldn't start the motor at all.\n\nThe French coastguard says it is patrolling this stretch of coast more heavily -- and, it says, it is now rescuing migrants every day. Arnaud, the captain of the \"Scarpe,\" a Swift patrol boat, tells us on one of his patrols that by the time they find the migrants \"they have seen death.\"\n\nMigrants are turning to dangerous dinghies to bypass charges set by people-smugglers for more traditional routes.\n\nOften it is the migrants themselves, unaware of the dangers when they set off, who call the emergency services shortly after leaving the coast. \"There are the ships, the cold, the current. It is dark and they don't know where they are. But within minutes they are soaked\" and then, says Arnaud, they are tossed about by the waves and currents in freezing winds.\n\nIt seems a miracle that any of the dinghies make it across. But that, says Peter Wallace, a local Labour party politician in the English port town of Dover, is exactly what has been happening.\n\nThe French coastguard says it is rescuing migrants from the Channel on a daily basis.\n\n\"In the last month there's been a huge increase -- there's been about 120 people or so that have claimed they've come from Iran,\" Wallace says. \"They were trying to get across in dinghies and before they were trying to get through the tunnel or in the back of lorries, but it's been this huge change in the last month with over 100 people, including little tiny children, trying to get across the whole Channel in little tiny boats.\"\n\nBritish government figures show that once they get to the UK, Iranians do stand a relatively good chance of being granted asylum. Of 2,500 requests by Iranians in 2017, more than 1,000 were successful. This compares with just over 200 successful requests by Iraqis out of 2,300 applications over the same period. And it is this hope that is driving the Iranians camping in northern France to take ever greater risks.\n\nAhmed says he wants to go to the UK to study and that nothing will stop him trying again, even on a dinghy. Nothing, not even death, he says, could be worse than living in the woodland camp and nothing, he suggests, will damp his determination. \"I have traveled 5,000 kilometers,\" says Ahmed. \"I live in the jungle. This is not for fun.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "American priest arrested in Philippines, accused of sexually abusing boys", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/EeDcsgRc-Qg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An American Catholic priest has been arrested in the Philippines -- and charged in US federal court -- on suspicion of sexually abusing boys in the Southeast Asian country where he's lived for decades, authorities in both nations announced.\n\nThe Rev. Kenneth Bernard Pius Hendricks, 77, originally from Cincinnati, was arrested Wednesday in the Philippine city of Naval after several alleged victims came forward to Philippine and US investigators last month, authorities said.\n\nThough court documents filed in late November cite five accusers, a total of 10 accusers have now come forward in the Philippines, alleging Hendricks sexually abused them when they were boys, US Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Steve Francis said Thursday in Cincinnati.\n\nBecause Hendricks also spends parts of the year in the United States, investigators are asking the public in both countries for information about the priest.\n\n\"It's horrifying ... abusive conduct,\" US attorney Benjamin Glassman said Thursday about the allegations in the Philippines. \"It's grooming children -- young children -- that are interested in being involved in church activities and taking those kids and sexually abusing them.\"\n\n\"He befriended them, he would invite them to his residence\" before engaging in progressively intimate contact, sometimes including oral and anal sex, Glassman said.\n\nUS law criminalizes certain illegal sexual conduct by American citizens abroad. Hendricks is charged in federal court in Cincinnati on a count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places , punishable by fines and/or up to 30 years in prison.\n\nHendricks was being held in a Philippines Bureau of Immigrations holding facility in Manila, the bureau said. His attorney in the Philippines, Mario Ope\u00f1a, told CNN that the priest maintains the allegations are false.\n\n\"As far as Father Hendricks is concerned, the allegations are not true and he will prove his innocence in court,\" Ope\u00f1a said.\n\nHow the investigation started\n\nHendricks has been a priest in Naval, a city of about 50,000 people in central Philippines, the country's Bureau of Immigration said.\n\nHe was ordained as a priest in the Philippines after arriving in the country in the 1960s, said the Rev. Benjamin Pantas, spokesman for the Diocese of Naval.\n\nThe Naval diocese is conducting a parallel, independent investigation, Pantas said.\n\nOf the allegations cited by the five accusers in a probable cause affidavit filed in court, the earliest dates to 2009. The accusers' ages at the start of the alleged abuse range from 7 to the teens, Glassman said.\n\nThe Philippine National Police began investigating around November 6 when two accusers, including a young man, came forward, the affidavit says.\n\nAmong the man's allegations, according to the document:\n\n\u2022 Hendricks began sexually abusing him around 2009 when he was a 12-year-old serving as a sacristan in a church in Naval. Hendricks first kissed him on the lips while the boy was cleaning the church.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would beg him to sleep at the priest's home, and the accuser believed he had no choice. The priest would insist that they bathe together, and the priest would have oral and anal sex with him.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would molest him alone or with several other boys who \"resided with Hendricks during that time.\"\n\n\u2022 Hendricks said they \"would both go to jail\" if the abuse was reported to authorities.\n\n\u2022 The abuse stopped when the accuser was 15, after he contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nAnother of the accusers alleged that Hendricks had anal sex at least a dozen times and oral sex more than 30 times, the Cincinnati US attorney's office said.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when or how the US Homeland Security Investigations agents got involved. But HSI agents interviewed the adult accuser and four other accusers November 26-28, the affidavit says.\n\n'I ... will have to probably really resign, retire now'\n\nHSI received a recorded conversation, purportedly between Hendricks and the adult accuser in November, in which the two apparently discuss the accuser having talked to police, the affidavit says.\n\nIn the recording, the priest said he's \"waiting for the fallout,\" according to the affidavit.\n\n\"There will be a meeting and then it will be decided, you know, what your parents want to do about anything. Do they want to try ... to press charges ... but that's between them and the bishop,\" Hendricks said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"They will decide, ask you what your decision is, what you're going to do, whether there will be a case or not or whether, you know, a settlement, I don't know. But as far as after that, I don't know what's going to happen. I really will have to probably really resign, retire now,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\nEventually, the affidavit says, the accuser asked whether Hendricks admits to having sex with boys.\n\n\"It's already blottered,\" Hendricks said, apparently referring to the accuser's conversation with police. \"You put it on a blotter. Will I lie? It was a mistake on my part. Should have known better than trying to just have life,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\n'Other children may have been impacted'\n\nGlassman, the US attorney, said Hendricks is not accused of abusing anyone in the United States, but investigators will explore the time he has spent in his native country.\n\nHendricks would spend several months a year in the United States -- likely in the Cincinnati area, after flying from the Philippines into Los Angeles, Glassman said.\n\nThe federal prosecutor said he didn't immediately know exactly where or how Hendricks would spend his time in the United States. But the affidavit says bank records indicate Hendricks has a residence in Cincinnati.\n\n\"We want to find out: Are there any victims in the United States -- in Cincinnati, in Ohio, Los Angeles or wherever?\" Glassman said during a news conference Thursday in Cincinnati. \"(We want to) hold Father Hendricks accountable for any sexual abuse of children here, just as we want to hold him accountable for any sexual abuse that he's committed in the Philippines.\"\n\nFrancis, the HSI agent, said: \"We believe there is a high probability that other children may have been impacted by his alleged actions.\"\n\nAsked whether the Philippines would want to put Hendricks on trial there instead of extraditing him to the United States, Glassman said: \"That is something we are working out with them right now.\"\n\nHendricks was not a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, archdiocese spokesman Mike Schafer said.\n\nThe priest as listed on the archdiocese's website as being a missionary in the Philippines.\n\nBut Schafer, in email to CNN, wrote that Hendricks \"is not 'assigned internationally by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati to mission work.'\"\n\n\"Hendricks is not, nor never has been, a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. He was ordained to the priesthood in the Philippines to serve in a diocese there,\" Schafer wrote.\n\nToni Cashnelli, communications director for the Franciscan Friars, Province of St. John the Baptist in Cincinnati, said Hendricks was a brother with the Franciscan Friars.\n\nHe made temporary vows in 1962, solemn vows in 1965 and in 1986 asked to be released, Cashnelli said.

It turns out that the damage done to Warren's political prospects in 2020 was significant, and has forced her allies to consider more drastic methods to take the issue off the table.\n\n\"Advisers close to Ms. Warren say she has privately expressed concern that she may have damaged her relationships to Native American groups and her own standing with activists, particularly those who are racial minorities. Several outside advisers are even more worried: They say they believe a plan should be made to repair that damage, possibly including a strong statement of apology.\"\n\nThat is a very big deal -- especially because this wound was entirely self-inflicted.\n\nDuring her 2016 Senate victory, Warren had dealt with questions about why she had listed herself as Native American in some staff directories during her time in academia -- and whether she had reaped any benefits as a result of that status.\n\n\"I am very proud of my heritage,\" Warren said in 2012 . \"These are my family stories. This is what my brothers and I were told by my mom and my dad, my mammaw and my pappaw. This is our lives. And I'm very proud of it.\"\n\nShe won -- and won relatively easily over then Sen. Scott Brown (R).\n\nThat victory didn't stop President Donald Trump from attacking her -- he referred to Warren as \"Pocahontas\" -- and rousing some low-level concerns among Democratic activists that the Massachusetts senator might need to tie the whole issue up in a bow if and when she ran for president in 2020. Even Democrats who wanted more clarity from Warren on the issue were struck when she released -- out of the blue -- the video. \"Why now?\" was a refrain I heard repeatedly from Democrats -- including many who regard Warren warmly.\n\nAnd unfortunately for Warren, the video -- and the DNA test which Warren took in it -- didn't clarify much of anything. When the \"wow\" moment of the video is when a geneticist tells Warren \"the facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree,\" you know the attempt to button this whole controversy up has failed. Estimates that Warren possesses from 1/64th to 1/1024th Native American heritage -- and those from people who were on Warren's side! -- didn't help matters.\n\nTrump, of course, had a field day. \"Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,\" he tweeted . \"She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, 'DNA test is useless.' Even they don't want her. Phony!\"\n\nIn the after-action report, it was clear how badly Warren's strategy had failed: Rather than get the issue off the table in advance of the start of the 2020 campaign, she had pushed her heritage (and the questions around it) into the national spotlight, offered nothing even close to definitive proof of anything and, in so doing, made herself an incredibly ripe target for the President of the United States.\n\nAgain, Herndon:\n\n\"Three people close to senior members of Ms. Warren's team, who were granted anonymity to speak freely on the issue, said they were 'shocked' and 'rattled' by the senator's decision to take the DNA test, which they described as an unequivocal misstep that could have lasting consequences, even on 2020 staffing.\"\n\nBringing attention to a weak spot is never a good thing for a politician. But that's even more true when you are asking Democratic voters to choose you to beat Donald Trump in two years' time. Trump has one approach as a candidate (and as President): He bullies. He picks somewhere where you are vulnerable and just picks and picks and picks at it. Low-energy Jeb Bush. Crooked Hillary Clinton.\n\nIf you are Warren, and Trump already has a ready-made nickname for you even before the 2020 campaign starts, you have to demonstrate that he won't be able to hurt you with it. That unlike Clinton, who was dogged by her decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, you can stand up to Trump's bullying in a way that will make people -- and not just hardcore Democrats -- believe you are in the right.\n\nShe did, literally, the opposite of that with her October surprise. Now, if you are a talented and ambitious staffer or a major donor or a voter looking for a candidate in the 2020 sweepstakes, you are almost certain to see Warren as a less solid bet than she was even two months ago. A much less solid bet.\n\nMomentum and perception matter in every aspect of life, but are particularly important in presidential politics. Warren lost both with her DNA debacle."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump calls for Mueller probe to end following Manafort, Cohen court filings", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/8O5tdUNerJc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Saturday that court filings in the Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen cases showed no collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\n\"We're very happy with what we're reading because there was no collusion whatsoever,\" Trump told reporters Saturday at the White House before boarding Marine One for the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump told reporters he has not read the court filings, which detail alleged lies Cohen and Manafort told publicly and to investigators.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes after being charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors.

They reveal that a Russian national who claimed connections to the Russian government spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn addition, the documents also detail how Manafort was directly in touch with a senior Trump administration official earlier this year as well as his contact with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national who Mueller's team says has ties to Russian intelligence services, though the details of those interactions are redacted.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nProsecutors say Trump directed Cohen\n\nFor the first time, federal prosecutors say that Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump.\n\nWhen Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations connected to the payments, Cohen stated in court that he had been directed by Trump.\n\nBut the sentencing memo from the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which was filed separately from Mueller's team, was the first time the government has stated Trump's role in the payments. Trump has denied the affairs, and he has not been accused of any crimes related to the payments.\n\n\"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\" prosecutors wrote in a reference to Trump.\n\nLying liars\n\nMueller's team documents a number of lies told by Cohen and Manafort -- and has the proof to back it up.\n\nManafort's legal team has disputed that he lied to the special counsel since entering into a cooperation agreement -- which would violate that agreement -- but Mueller has texts. The court filing cites a text exchange in which Manafort authorized an associate to speak to a Trump administration official on his behalf.\n\nIn all, Mueller accuses Manafort of lying on five separate matters.\n\nCohen's lies, some of which he admitted to in a guilty plea last week, included lying to the special counsel investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project after offering to cooperate. Mueller's team says he eventually took responsibility for his lies, later explaining he was trying not to contradict his congressional testimony.\n\nThere are now three officials in Trump's orbit accused of lying to the special counsel: Manafort, Cohen and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates who pleaded guilty to lying during one of his early meetings with Mueller's team.\n\nTrump Tower Moscow is relevant to meddling\n\nMueller's memo lays out how the Trump Tower Moscow project is relevant to Russia's election meddling during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe fact that Cohen continued to work on the proposal through June 2016, not ending in January as he falsely testified -- and he discussed it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, the special counsel said.\n\nMueller said that the continued work on Trump Tower Moscow \"occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nThe special counsel memo states that Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThe argument in Cohen's filing underscores that the overlap of business and politics is relevant to the special counsel's inquiry.\n\nFalse public statements also key to investigation\n\nThe special counsel's office made clear that it sees not just lies to investigators but also false public statements as significant in the Cohen sentencing memo.\n\nProsecutors explained that Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project continuing through June 2016 were an effort to alter the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses. By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, the special counsel stressed that Michael Flynn's false statement also impacted what others said publicly.\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between [Flynn] and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" Mueller wrote.\n\nInterestingly, Mueller redacts the rest of the paragraph. So if the impact was explained, it is still a secret.\n\nThe emphasis on public statements could offer clues at how prosecutors view the relevance of efforts to misdirect in formulating the first public statement about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting aboard Air Force One the next year.\n\nOne of the questions that Mueller wanted to ask Trump, as seen in the questions that were given to the President's lawyers earlier this year, focused just on that: \"What involvement did you have in the communication strategy, including the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s emails?\"\n\nWhy did Manafort try to hide contacts with administration officials?\n\nOne of the mysteries in the Manafort court filing: Who was he allegedly contacting in the Trump administration during 2018 -- and why?\n\nMueller accuses Manafort of lying about multiple contacts with Trump administration officials, including a senior administration official. Mueller cites a May 2018 text exchange authorizing an associate to contact one official, and a Manafort colleague describing a February 2018 contact with the senior official.\n\nIt's not clear why Manafort was conducting the outreach -- but Mueller's team signals in the filing that it likely has the answer.\n\n\"A review of documents recovered from a search of Manafort's electronic documents demonstrations additional contacts with Administration officials,\" the filing states.\n\nWhy Mueller still thinks Cohen's credible\n\nWhile the special counsel's office does not make a recommendation to give Cohen reduced prison time, Mueller still says that Cohen was a cooperative witness.\n\nAnd Mueller's team makes a reference to Cohen's credibility, which is poised to be a key question if any of the information Cohen provides is used in other cases the special counsel is pursuing -- especially given that Mueller documents how Cohen even lied to the special counsel.\n\nIn the court filing, Mueller's team notes that the information that Cohen provided \"has been credible and consistent with other evidence obtained\" in the special counsel's ongoing investigation, which signals the special counsel investigators independently corroborated what Cohen told them.\n\nMueller outlined four areas where Cohen cooperated, which include his own contacts with \"Russian interests\" during the 2016 campaign, \"useful information\" concerning Russia-related matters, contacts with people connected to the Trump White House and \"the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries.\"\n\nCohen was less useful to Manhattan US Attorney's office, which said that the information Cohen provided to the New York Attorney General's office in their ongoing case against the Trump Foundation \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\n\"After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen's decision to plead guilty -- rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes -- does not make him a hero,\" prosecutors wrote."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Prosecutors: Michael Cohen acted at Trump's direction when he broke the law", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/0ui5FEyRWHQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) Federal prosecutors said for the first time Friday that Michael Cohen acted at the direction of Donald Trump when the former fixer committed two election-related crimes during the 2016 presidential campaign, as special counsel Robert Mueller outlined a previously undisclosed set of overtures and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals.\n\nThose revelations came in a set of court filings in which federal prosecutors in New York said Cohen should receive a \"substantial\" prison sentence of roughly four years for tax fraud and campaign-finance crimes, and as Mueller's office accused the President's former attorney of lying to them about his contacts with Russia.\n\nMueller's disclosures also exposed deeper entanglements than previously known between Trump, his campaign apparatus and the Russian government, including that a Russian national who claimed to be well-connected in Moscow spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes after being charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors.

He pleaded guilty, disclosing that talks about the effort in Moscow had extended through June 2016, after Trump had become the presumptive Republican nominee for president, and that both Trump and his family members had been briefed on the discussions. Cohen also acknowledged pursuing plans to send Trump and himself to Russia in service of the project and discussing the proposed development directly with a representative of the Kremlin.\n\nThe special counsel's Friday memo on the matter suggested that Cohen's -- and, by extension, Trump's -- intersection with Russians eager to aid the presidential campaign was more substantial than previously known, with the Russians anxious to put Trump face-to-face with their president.\n\nIn one instance, Cohen spoke in November 2015 to a Russian national who offered \"synergy on a government level\" to the Trump presidential campaign and \"repeatedly proposed\" a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to court papers.\n\nThe interest appears to have been reciprocal. Cohen told the special counsel that he had consulted with Trump about his interest in contacting the Russian government before suggesting in a radio interview in September 2015 that Trump meet with Putin during the Russian President's visit to New York City that fall.\n\nCohen had previously claimed his comments on air were spontaneous, the court papers said, but he admitted to prosecutors that they came about after his discussion with Trump.\n\nThat meeting never happened, nor did the one with the Russian national, although Cohen told the special counsel that was due to the fact that he was working on the Moscow project \"with a different individual who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.\"\n\nMueller's sentencing memo also provided the first explanation of the Trump Tower Moscow project's relevance to Russia's interference during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAccording to the special counsel, Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThat Cohen continued to work on the Trump Tower Moscow project -- and discuss it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, prosecutors said, noting in particular that \"it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nA tightening net\n\nThe filings on Cohen, and a submission from Mueller about Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, appear to further tighten the net that Mueller is gathering around the President and his inner circle.\n\nThey come at a time when Trump appears to be increasingly worried and furious about the investigation, following a searing tweet storm aimed at the special counsel on Friday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed the significance of prosecutors' findings, saying late Friday that \"the government's filings in Mr. Cohen's case tell us nothing of value that wasn't already known. Mr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.\"\n\nThe memos also appear to take aim at several issues that have and could continue to ensnare others in the President's orbit, including the act of lying not just to federal agents but also to the public and the media. Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project, they said, constituted an attempt to alter the course of the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses,\" prosecutors wrote. \"By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nProsecutors unhappy with Cohen's cooperation\n\nDespite Cohen's disclosures to the special counsel, however, Manhattan federal prosecutors sought repeatedly to emphasize the limited nature of his assistance in other investigations.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors have continued to investigate the Trump Organization based on information in the charges against Cohen, CNN has reported, and Cohen met with prosecutors to discuss \"the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes,\" they said in their filing. But, they noted, he \"declined to meet with the office about other areas of investigative interest.\"\n\nProsecutors also said the information Cohen has provided to the New York State Attorney General's Office, which has a civil lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation, \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\nAnd while Cohen has met with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which has also been examining the Trump Organization, CNN has reported, his assistance \"appears to consist solely of providing that entity information that they would otherwise have obtained via subpoena.\"\n\nThe Cohen cases are being considered together for sentencing purposes. In the New York federal prosecutors' case, the sentencing guidelines call for a term of 51 to 63 months in prison, and prosecutors on Friday asked the court to \"impose a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable guidelines range.\"\n\nUS District Judge William Pauley III can deviate from the guidelines when he determines Cohen's sentence.\n\nCohen's attorneys have asked the court to give him no prison time, but prosecutors on Friday voiced their objection to that proposal, noting that the crimes Cohen committed had far-reaching consequences that extended all the way to the White House.\n\n\"While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\" they wrote.\n\n\"He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1,\" they said. \"In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump announces John Kelly is leaving", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ugemmbOjHU4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) White House chief of staff John Kelly will be leaving his position at the end of the year, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"John Kelly will be leaving at the end of the year,\" Trump told reporters before departing the White House for the Army-Navy game.\n\nTrump noted Kelly had been with him for almost two years in his roles as chief of staff and secretary of homeland security.\n\n\"I appreciate his service very much,\" Trump said.\n\nKelly's status had become endangered in recent months as his relationship with the President deteriorated. He was not on speaking terms with Trump during his last days, two officials told CNN, and their relationship was no longer seen as tenable.\n\nVice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, has been considered a top contender to replace Kelly for more than six months. But Trump did not announce a replacement for Kelly on Saturday, saying only that he will in the coming days, and it's still unclear if Ayers will be offered the job.\n\nA White House official told CNN that the President and Ayers are still negotiating terms for him to become Trump's chief of staff.\n\nAyers has told Trump that he wants to move back to his home state of Georgia at the end of the year, citing his young children, the official said. But Ayers offered to postpone it and become chief of staff temporarily. Trump, however, wants a two-year commitment.\n\nAyers and Kelly both typically join Trump and Pence during their weekly lunch in the dining room outside the Oval Office.\n\nKelly, who did not travel with the President to Kansas City on Friday, was also reportedly interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's team in recent months, three people with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The White House did not respond to request for comment about the discussions.\n\nKelly had been on the verge of resigning or being fired several times, only to bounce back each time. He was brought on to bring order to the White House, but his influence waned in recent months, and his time as chief of staff was often marked by the same infighting and controversy that has largely defined Trump's presidency from the beginning.\n\nTrump and Kelly had discussed the chief of staff's departure over the last 24 hours, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Although it was not the plan to announce the move on the South Lawn, Kelly, knowing Trump, realized it could come at any moment, whether by tweet or abrupt announcement, the source said.\n\nOnce seen as stabilizing force\n\nWhen Kelly first replaced Reince Priebus as chief of staff, he ruled with an iron fist. He curbed Oval Office access, blocked certain outsiders from being able to call the White House switchboard and executed authority over staffing. But in the last months of his tenure, Kelly saw his status as chief of staff diminish.\n\nTrump began circumventing many of the policies and protocols Kelly enacted. And Trump often vacillated between criticizing and praising Kelly, sometimes within minutes of each other. Kelly started holding increasingly fewer senior staff meetings \u2014 once daily occurrences that were whittled down to weekly gatherings \u2014 and exerted less control over who talked to the President, which was once his sticking point.\n\nKelly's tenure working for Trump was marked by controversies, and officials were often amazed at how he managed to survive. Weeks after taking over for Priebus, his predecessor who was unceremoniously fired over Twitter while he sat on a rainy tarmac, Kelly was faced with the Charlottesville, Virginia, controversy. He was photographed looking grim-faced in the lobby of Trump Tower as the President declared there were \"good people\" on both sides of the racist violence.\n\nWhite House officials believed Kelly was close to resigning after he got into a heated argument that turned into a shouting match with national security adviser John Bolton in October. Bolton had criticized Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during a discussion about the border, and Kelly stormed out of the West Wing after their profanity-laced argument.\n\nAt times, Kelly was the source of his own downfall. He insulted Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, using inaccurate information, later declaring he would \"never\" apologize. He said some of those eligible for protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program were \"lazy.\"\n\nBut perhaps most damaging was his handling of the situation involving former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who was accused by two of his ex-wives of abuse. Kelly's shifting accounts caused his credibility inside the West Wing to plummet, and it never truly recovered, according to officials.\n\nKelly's highly criticized handling of the Porter controversy was an inflection point in his tenure, and some of his internal relationships became strained in the months that followed the former staff secretary's ouster."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: Friday was a very, very bad day for Donald Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/jd9mkGEDYgY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) On Friday, President Donald Trump (and the rest of us) got the most fulsome look into the inner workings of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation yet.

Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health. Since the outbreak began, the total number of probable cases is now 471, including 273 deaths, the ministry reported Thursday .\n\nPublic health authorities are investigating an additional 106 suspected cases, the ministry indicated.\n\nSecond-largest outbreak in history\n\nThis is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the second this year. It is also now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.\n\nOn average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August, has a case fatality rate of 57%.\n\nThe ministry also reported that 149 people have recovered. However, 44 health workers have been infected with the virus, of whom 12 have died.\n\nNorth Kivu province, which includes the cities of Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province, according to the World Health Organization. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\n\"Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge,\" WHO said in a report Thursday.\n\nWHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.\n\nGender imbalance\n\nWomen and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thursday . To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.\n\nThe \"multitude of factors\" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.\n\n\"Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),\" WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.\n\nThe ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major clinical trial conducted during an outbreak in Guinea, according to WHO.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFresh guidance issued Thursday by the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies Working Group, an international team of 17 experts, seeks to ensure that pregnant women are no longer excluded from receiving vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.\n\nThe public health preparedness report, which offers concrete steps for equitably addressing the needs of pregnant women, includes 22 total recommendations. One is that during an epidemic, such as the current one, the default setting should be to offer vaccines to pregnant women, not the reverse.

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.\n\nGlobal leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality.

It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money.

led to an \"inaccurate\" story about federal funding of controversial fetal tissue research, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.\n\nHHS's National Institutes of Health has made no decision on whether to extend a University of California, San Francisco contract for controversial research involving fetal tissue, said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS.\n\nHer statement contradicts Washington Post reporting Tuesday that the \"Trump administration has thrown into doubt a multimillion-dollar research contract\" with UCSF to test new treatments for HIV.\n\nAccording to the Post, an anonymous source said a National Institutes of Health official told a UCSF investigator that the decision to end a seven-year contract before its completion was coming from the \"highest levels.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Washington Post chose to report assertions that are completely false,\" Oakley said.\n\nOakley said that there were \"no traceable records\" proving these claims made by the Post's anonymous source and that \"multiple, on-the-record assurances from senior officials at both the National Institutes of Health and in the Office of the Secretary\" told the Post that the claims were incorrect.\n\nThe Post also reported that a letter from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the contract would continue for 90 days rather than the expected year-long renewal.\n\n\"No contracting official would have had the authority to impart any communication to UCSF that the contract was being cancelled because no decision has been made,\" Oakley said.\n\nRenate Myles, a spokeswoman for the NIH, said on Thursday that \"NIH did, however, send a letter to UCSF to notify them of our intent to ensure continuity of service for 90 days while the audit continues and until a final decision is made on the contract.\"\n\nDoan would not comment, though she said the \"research is conducted in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as ethical standards.\"\n\nOakley emphasized that \"a decision will be made when the contract has been reviewed, pursuant to the ongoing audit/review process\" initiated by the HHS in September\n\nThe battle over human fetal tissue research\n\nTwo months ago, the HHS did terminate a contract: one struck between the Food and Drug Administration (an agency within the HHS) and a biotech company that was slated to provide about $16,000 of human fetal tissue for federal research.\n\nThe FDA explained in a notice posted online that \"fresh human tissues are required\" to create mice with human immune systems, which is necessary when testing drugs \"for safety and efficacy.\"\n\nHowever, a response letter from more than 80 House Republications to the FDA called for the cancellation of this federal contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc.\n\nIn September, the HHS not only terminated the contract, it stated that \"in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved,\" it had \"initiated a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue\" while \"continuing to review whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\"\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is obtained through elective abortions and is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report\n\nThe National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows . Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date.

It was a very scary point in my life.\"\n\nDr Nicky Keay, a sport and dance endocrinologist, says Red-S occurs when the athlete's body does not have enough energy to sustain it and begins to shut down.\n\nShe says: \"The body partitions the energy you get from your diet. You need an amount to cover training, then the remaining energy is what you need for day-to-day life.\n\n\"If you're not getting enough spare energy you go into survival mode.

As a flag breaks up the wind, it creates oscillations in frequency that the human ear perceives as flapping.\n\nA pressure sensor that is part of InSight's meteorological experiment also recorded the passing of the wind.\n\nScientists estimate the air was moving at between five and seven metres per second, from the north-west to the south-east. This fits with satellite pictures that show the tracks left by dust devils travelling in the same direction.\n\nNasa's InSight spacecraft is the latest robotic resident on the Red Planet. After making a dramatic touchdown on 26 November following a six-month journey from Earth, the probe is now surveying its surroundings and testing its systems.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the mission, which is sited on a flat plain just north of Mars' equator, is to study the world's interior.\n\nAs well as seismometers, InSight is equipped with a heat probe that will burrow into the ground, and a very sensitive radio experiment that will measure how the planet wobbles on its axis.\n\nThe data should reveal the position and nature of all the rock layers below the surface of Mars - from the crust to the core. It is information that can be compared and contrasted with Earth.\n\nThe wind recording is something that will soon be beyond the UK seismometers, which are known as Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, or SEIS.\n\nA few weeks from now, the package will be lifted on to the ground by a robotic arm and covered with a wind shield. This bell-shaped device will protect SEIS from the weather and allow the sensors to concentrate on their primary task of detecting earthquakes, or rather \"marsquakes\".\n\nCo-investigator Dr Neil Bowles, from the University of Oxford, said: \"To get the first data from the seismometer instrument package has been fantastic and even with a short test run the analysis is now full swing.\n\n\"To 'hear' the low-frequency rumble of the Martian wind on the lander being picked up by [SEIS] is really eerie and provides a strangely human connection to this very different environment.\"\n\nThe UK Space Agency invested \u00a34m in the seismometer package.\n\nThe organisation's head of space exploration, Sue Horne, said: \"This is brilliant news because it means we know the sensors have survived the rigours of landing on Mars and are meeting the requirements to achieve their science goals.\n\n\"It is just amazing to hear the first ever sounds from Mars.\"\n\nThe audio recordings released to the public are almost completely unaltered.

This was probably formed by a giant asteroid impact billions of years ago.\n\nThe landers will characterise the region's geology and the composition of rock and soil.\n\nBecause of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one \"face\" of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThough often referred to as the \"dark side\", this face of the Moon is also illuminated by the Sun and has the same phases as the near side; \"dark\" in this context simply means \"unseen\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The lunar far side has a thicker crust and is more heavily cratered than the near side\n\nThe far side looks rather different to the more familiar near side. It has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also few of the \"mare\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nThe powerful impact that created the South Pole Aitken Basin may have punched through the crust down to the Moon's mantle layer.

The \"lunar mini biosphere\" experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities.\n\n\"We want to study the respiration of the seeds and the photosynthesis on the Moon,\" Liu Hanlong, chief director of the experiment and vice president of Chongqing University, told the state-run Xinhua news agency earlier this year.\n\nImage copyright CNSA Image caption China's Yutu rover, part of the Chang'e-3 mission, explored the Moon in 2013\n\nXie Gengxin, chief designer of the experiment, told Xinhua: \"We have to keep the temperature in the 'mini biosphere' within a range from 1 degree to 30 degrees, and properly control the humidity and nutrition. We will use a tube to direct the natural light on the surface of Moon into the tin to make the plants grow.\"\n\nBecause the landers on the far side have no line of sight with our planet, they must send data back via a relay satellite named Queqiao, launched by China in May this year.\n\nThe probe's design is based on that of its predecessor, Chang'e-3, which deployed landing craft to the Moon's Mare Imbrium region in 2013. However, it has some important modifications.\n\nChina's lunar ambitions\n\nThe lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform the low-frequency radio astronomy observations.\n\nThe rover will carry a panoramic camera; a radar to probe beneath the lunar surface; an imaging spectrometer to identify minerals; and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface.\n\nThe mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Trump's environmental rollback rolls on", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46471447", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright The Christian Science Monitor via Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration has dealt a double blow to Obama-era environmental policies in an ongoing rollback that has targeted scores of rules.\n\nThe Department of the Interior unveiled plans to allow oil drilling on millions of acres that have been off-limits to protect the greater sage grouse.\n\nAnd the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it would end rules limiting carbon emissions on new coal plants.\n\nThe rollback continues despite the US' own dire warnings about climate change.\n\nInterior department documents said Thursday's order would protect sage grouse \"while also ensuring that conservation efforts do not impede local economic opportunities\".\n\nThe interior department plan is expected to be finalised in 2019.\n\nThe greater sage grouse, a chicken-like bird known for its striking plumage and mating dances, has a habitat spanning parts of 10 states from California to the Dakotas.\n\nBut less than half a million of the birds remain, making the species near threatened.\n\nNada Culver, of conservation group The Wilderness Society, said in a statement about the policy: \"The sum total of these changes may well be more than the species can bear.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The energy industry had criticised the 2015 land protections as bad for developement\n\nMeanwhile, the EPA also pressed ahead on Thursday with a plan to lift restrictions for carbon emissions from new coal plants.\n\nOnly two new plants are currently expected to open over the next four years, according to Reuters news agency, but the policy changes could spur more to be built.\n\nThe plan would allow new coal plants to emit up to 1,900lb (862kg) of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity, replacing the current limit of 1,400lb.\n\nThe EPA is also asking for public comment on how to define the phrase \"causes or contributes significantly to\" air pollution.\n\nUnveiling the policy in Washington, EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler said: \"We are rescinding unfair burdens, levelling the playing field.\"\n\nMore on climate change\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nLast month President Donald Trump dismissed a report by his own government warning of future devastating economic consequences to the US from climate change.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" the Republican president told reporters.\n\nSupporters of his policies welcome them as an overdue cutback of green tape that they argue is holding back businesses.\n\nThe Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School is tracking the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.\n\nIts running list currently has more than 100 entries.\n\nThe Sabin Center notes repeated attempts by Department of the Interior and other agencies to expand onshore oil and gas drilling, including on public lands.\n\nIt also points to repeated proposals to weaken regulations controlling emissions of methane - a highly potent greenhouse gas.\n\nRomany Webb, senior fellow at the Sabin Center, cited three other far-reaching measures taken by this administration so far."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Zoologists Discover New Fastest Land Animal After Pumping White-Tailed Deer Full Of Steroids", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/zoologists-discover-new-fastest-land-animal-after-pumpi-1830946788", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "MADISON, WI\u2014Shedding new light on the now-500-pound forest-dwelling antlered ungulant, zoologists at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison announced the discovery of a new fastest land animal Friday after systematically subjecting a white-tailed deer to a regimen of specially tailored anabolic steroids. \u201cSome cheetahs can temporarily reach a speed as high as 75 mph, which for much of history made them the fastest terrestrial mammal.

His case is currently being considered for retrial. Robinson has a serial criminal history, having previously been jailed for assault and attempting to enter the United States on a false passport.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, far-right activists, some from across the world, rallied to his cause, insisting he was an innocent victim of a plot by the British government to silence him.\n\nThe right-wing US think-tank Middle East Forum spent $60,000 on Robinson's legal defence and a series of demonstrations in London this summer, part of a growing international network, as documented by The Guardian newspaper, that provides him with financial and political support.\n\nRobinson was appointed by Batten as UKIP's official adviser on grooming gangs and prisons last month, circumventing the party's rules which bar former EDL members and pushing the extreme right-wing party further towards open Islamophobia.\n\nThe decision prompted a slew of resignations from the party, including long-time leader Nigel Farage.\n\n\"The very idea of Tommy Robinson being at the centre of the Brexit debate is too awful to contemplate,\" Farage wrote in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nFarage is credited with having had significant influence over pushing Britons towards choosing to leave the EU and has himself been accused of Islamophobia."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Nikki Haley says US 'can't give Saudi a pass' on Khashoggi murder", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/nikki-haley-give-saudi-pass-khashoggi-murder-181209065801936.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:08", "body_paragraphs": "Nikki Haley, the outgoing US ambassador to the UN, has said the United States should not give Saudi Arabia a pass for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHaley, who will leave her position at the end of the year, made her statements in an interview with US publication The Atlantic.\n\n\"You have Saudi government officials that did this in a Saudi consulate.

For five years we have waited for their release, clinging to rumours that they're still alive, and hoping that they will soon be free.\n\nFor people across Syria, the Douma Four, as they are now known, are household names, heroes of the 2011 revolution. That year, they helped found the Local Coordination Committees - media teams and groups across the country that reported on the uprisings, wherever they were.\n\nFrom day one of the revolution, the Assad regime was desperate to disconnect towns and cities, to disconnect people from each other and prevent them from knowing what was going on. The Local Coordination Committees undid that. In a divided country, they brought Syrians together and told them the truth. It was their creation, along with Razan's co-founding of the Violations Documentation Centre, that made the Douma Four the enemies of all those who opposed a free and democratic Syria.\n\nThe Four knew how dangerous their work was but they considered the risks worth taking. For Razan, the one I am closest to, speaking out against injustice was what she devoted her entire career to.\n\nI met her prior to 2011 when I was subject to a travel ban in Syria for my work on gender equality. I consulted her for legal advice and she would always laugh off my worry, she kept trying to make me feel better about the situation.\n\nShe had had her own run-ins with the Assad regime. For her work defending political prisoners, she was targeted by the security services and often questioned by them, though she never feared them.\n\nI remember in early March 2011, before the revolution had begun, there was a demonstration by the families of political prisoners outside a court in Damascus. The secret police arrived and began arresting the families, dragging them into the court. Among the arrested was my friend's mother and so I ran to the protest, to try and find out what had happened.\n\nNo one knew what to do. One mother was shouting for her son and asking why he had been taken but no one replied. Then Razan swept out of the court and started telling people, \"you, your mother is okay, your child is fine, I just spoke to your husband.\" She was sick with flu but it didn't lessen the power she embodied that day, the way she was determined to make sure everybody was alright.\n\nAlthough people often think of Syrian society as dominated by men, in 2011, Razan was the name dominating the news, the name inspiring young Syrians to push for human rights. When she was forced into hiding in early 2011, I remember watching her sit on the couch with her laptop communicating with citizen journalists across the country, tweeting, writing about what was going on, reporting to human rights organisations. She, and the rest of the Douma Four, became my idols.\n\nTheir aim was to show the world that Syrians still believed in democracy, despite what the regime said. I remember Wael had so much faith in our people, he would tell us, \"trust the people, the revolution won't come from activists alone, let's trust Syrians and work with them.\"\n\nThat's what drove them back to Douma. In 2012, when the regime lost control of the area, they decided to go there because they wanted to work directly with the people, to spread knowledge of human rights and document the violations of armed groups there. They worked with militants to draw up a kind of ethical charter that would guarantee the freedoms of civilians and continued to be outspoken about their violations.\n\nA year later, it seems the armed groups were tired of their dissent. On 9 December 2013, I received a phone call from a friend who asked me, \"have you checked Facebook?\" I asked her what was wrong and she told me, \"just go online, go online\". We couldn't talk over the phone because just mentioning Razan or Douma would put you at risk.\n\nI logged in to Facebook and saw posts by friends saying the Violations Documentation Centre in Douma had been attacked by masked men and that Razan, Wael, Samira and Nazem were missing. I was in Damascus, just 20 minutes away by car but I couldn't go to Douma because it was under siege by the regime. The first thing that came to my mind was that the regime had done this - we were used to detention and kidnapping from them. It wasn't that common for us to suspect other actors.\n\nThe amount of solidarity pouring out from across Syria was overwhelming. People were asking, \"where are the Douma Four, they're our revolutionaries, where are they?\" My phone was constantly ringing. We thought it would only be a day and we'd know what happened to them but as the days passed, we realised we might never know. Most people think the armed group Jaysh al-Islam (the Army of Islam) took them, but it's impossible to know for sure.\n\nTheir loss is still felt across Syria, where more than 100,000 people have been held by the regime and armed groups. The Douma Four represent us - me, my friends, the people who believe in freedom for this country. They didn't give up on Syria, they stayed and took the risks of working with communities they didn't have strong relationships with, of documenting human rights violations of all actors in the conflict.\n\nI often think, who is the Razan Zeitouneh of next generation? Who will be the next Samira, Wael, Nazem? Who will inspire them to push for a better Syria? My country needs people like the Douma Four, brave activists who are willing to sacrifice everything for the common good, for universal freedoms. The Douma Four changed the lives of so many people in Syria; they made me a better person. It's hard to have hope after five long years, but I pray that this is the year they come back to us.\n\nLaila Kiki is not the real name of the author.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

On Friday, the Saudi and Russian envoys haggled in Vienna for two hours, consulting their governments by phone during the bargaining, OPEC officials said.\n\n\n\nSome analysts see the Russian agreement for the production cut as further evidence of the warming ties between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi crown prince, who enthusiastically shared a high-five a hand slap at last week's Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires.\n\n\n\nIn the run-up to the meeting featuring the OPEC countries and a so-called Russia-led super cartel of 10 oil-producing countries, including Kazakhstan, analysts had forecast that a muddled middle course would be plotted, with Saudi Arabia likely to be more cautious about defying Trump while moving to bump up prices.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. leader tweeted he hoped OPEC would \"be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted.\" He added: \"The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!\"\n\n\n\nIn October as sanctions talk flared in Washington, Saudi officials warned that the Gulf kingdom could exploit its oil status to disrupt the global economy, if it wanted. The Saudi government threatened to retaliate against any punishment such as economic sanctions, outside political pressure or even \"repeated false accusations\" about the Khashoggi killing, although it walked back the threat subsequently following signs that the Trump administration had no appetite for imposing sanctions on the long-term U.S. ally.\n\nSaudi Arabia doesn't wield the same level of power on the oil market \u2014 thanks in part to U.S. shale oil production \u2014 as it did in 1973, when it triggered an oil embargo against Western countries for supporting Israel. However, it still wields enormous influence, analysts say. The U.S. is the third-biggest destination for Saudi crude. OPEC accounts for about one-third of global crude production.\n\n\n\nIf the U.S. Congress decides to impose sanctions, the Saudis could react by reducing oil exports further and force prices to rise to $100 a barrel, some market experts said.\n\n\n\nExemptions for importers\n\nU.S. officials said they had expected that OPEC would decide to cut production. They said that is why U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo granted exemptions last month for eight oil-importing countries to continue to buy oil from Tehran when announcing details of the reimposition of sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n\nThis week, U.S. senators are due to take aim at the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen and will hold an unprecedented vote on ending U.S. support for the war."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Announces Departure of Chief of Staff Kelly", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-announces-departure-of-chief-of-staff-kelly/4692506.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "The latest impending White House high-profile departure is the top official who traditionally controls access to the Oval Office.\n\nChief of Staff John Kelly is exiting by the end of this month, President Donald Trump told reporters on Saturday.\n\n\u201cJohn Kelly will be leaving \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I can say \u2018retiring.\u2019 But, he\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn.\n\nKelly\u2019s successor is widely expected to be Nick Ayers, the young, politically savvy chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nNew staff\n\nTrump, before boarding Marine One, said he would announce his next chief of staff \u201cover the next day or two.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s imminent departure comes as no surprise.

It has a different composition than sites on the near side, where previous missions have landed.\n\n\n\nIf successful, the mission would propel the Chinese space program to a leading position in one of the most important areas of lunar exploration.\n\n\n\nChina landed its Yutu, or \u201cJade Rabbit,\u201d rover on the moon five years ago and plans to send its Chang'e 5 probe there next year and have it return to Earth with samples \u2014 the first time that will have been done since 1976. A crewed lunar mission is also under consideration.\n\nChang'e 4 is also a lander-rover combination and will explore both above and below the lunar surface after arriving at the South Pole-Aitken basin's Von Karman crater following a 27-day journey.\n\n\n\nIt will also perform radio-astronomical studies that, because the far side always faces away from Earth, will be \u201cfree from interference from our planet's ionosphere, human-made radio frequencies and auroral radiation noise,'' space industry expert Leonard David wrote on the website Space.com.\n\n\n\nIt may also carry plant seeds and silkworm eggs, according to Xinhua.\n\n\n\nChang'e is the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology.\n\n\n\nChina conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, making it only the third country after Russia and the U.S. to do so. It has put a pair of space stations into orbit, one of which is still operating as a precursor to a more than 60-ton station that is due to come online in 2022. The launch of a Mars rover is planned for the mid-2020s.\n\n\n\nTo facilitate communication between controllers on Earth and the Chang'e 4 mission, China in May launched a relay satellite named Queqiao, or \u201cMagpie Bridge,'' after an ancient Chinese folk tale.\n\n\n\nChina's space program has benefited from cooperation with Russia and European nations, although it was excluded from the 420-ton International Space Station, mainly because of U.S. legislation barring such cooperation amid concerns over its strong military connections. Its program also suffered a rare setback last year with the failed launch of its Long March 5 rocket."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "New NASA Lander Captures 1st Sounds of Martian Wind", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/new-nasa-lander-captures-1st-sounds-of-martian-wind/4691708.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "NASA\u2019s new Mars lander has captured the first sounds of the \u201creally unworldly\u201d Martian wind.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory released audio clips of the alien wind Friday. The low-frequency rumblings were collected by the InSight lander during its first week of operations at Mars.\n\nThe wind is estimated to be blowing 10 mph to 15 mph (16 kph to 24 kph). These are the first sounds from Mars that are detectible by human ears, according to the researchers.\n\n\u201cReminds me of sitting outside on a windy summer afternoon ... In some sense, this is what it would sound like if you were sitting on the InSight lander on Mars,\u201d Cornell University\u2019s Don Banfield told reporters.\n\nScientists involved in the project agree the sound has an otherworldly quality to it.\n\nThomas Pike of Imperial College London said the rumbling is \u201crather different to anything that we\u2019ve experienced on Earth, and I think it just gives us another way of thinking about how far away we are getting these signals.\u201d\n\nThe noise is of the wind blowing against InSight\u2019s solar panels and the resulting vibration of the entire spacecraft. The sounds were recorded by an air pressure sensor inside the lander that\u2019s part of a weather station, as well as the seismometer on the deck of the spacecraft.\n\nThe low frequencies are a result of Mars\u2019 thin air density and even more so the seismometer itself \u2014 it\u2019s meant to detect underground seismic waves, well below the threshold of human hearing. The seismometer will be moved to the Martian surface in the coming weeks; until then, the team plans to record more wind noise.\n\nThe 1976 Viking landers on Mars picked up spacecraft shaking caused by wind, but it would be a stretch to consider it sound, said InSight\u2019s lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt, of JPL in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe \u201creally unworldly\u201d sounds from InSight, meanwhile, have Banerdt imaging he\u2019s \u201con a planet that\u2019s in some ways like the Earth, but in some ways really alien.\u201d\n\nInSight landed on Mars on Nov. 26.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all still on a high from the landing last week ... and here we are less than two weeks after landing, and we\u2019ve already got some amazing new science,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Lori Glaze, acting director of planetary science. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, it\u2019s fun.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "California Scientists Developing Drones That Can Learn", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/california-scientists-developing-drones-that-can-learn/4692795.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The role drones play in our lives today is becoming greater and greater, as are the capabilities of these autonomous flying robots.

Such back doors are unlikely to remain secret, meaning that hackers and criminals could easily exploit them.\n\n\n\nBack doors were central to a 1990s U.S. effort to require manufacturers to install a so-called \"Clipper chip\" into communications equipment so the government could listen in on voice and data transmissions. U.S. law enforcement officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, are again pushing for legislation that would somehow give authorities access to secure communications.\n\n\n\nThe Australian bill is seen by many as a beachhead for those efforts because the nation belongs to the \"Five Eyes'' security alliance with the U.S., Britain, Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\"There is a lot here that doesn't make any sense,'' Schneier said of the Australian bill. \"This is a technological law written by non-technologists and it's not just bad policy. In many ways, I think it's unworkable.''\n\n\n\nA leading figure in cryptography, Martin Hellman of Stanford University, said it appears the bill would \"facilitate crime by weakening the security of the affected devices.''\n\nBlow against 'evil work'\n\n\n\nThe law won final legislative approval late Thursday, parliament's final session of the year. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was urgently needed.\n\n\n\n\"This was very important legislation to give police and security agencies the ability to get into encrypted communications,'' he told Nine Network television. \"Things like WhatsApp, things like that which are used by terrorists and organized criminals and indeed pedophile rings to do their evil work.''\n\n\n\nHe noted that the opposition Labor Party \"had to be dragged to the table'' and backed the legislation as an emergency measure out of concern extremists could target Christmas-New Year crowds.\n\n\n\nLabor lawmakers said they want amendments passed when parliament resumes in February. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said he supported the current bill only because he could not \"expose Australians to increased [national security] risk.''\n\n\n\nDuncan Lewis, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, noted during hearings that extremists share encrypted messages that Australia's main secret service cannot intercept or read.\n\n\n\nPresident Morry Bailles of the Law Council of Australia, a leading lawyers group, criticized the bill's swift parliamentary journey though lawmakers knew \"serious problems exist'' with giving law enforcement \"unprecedented powers to access encrypted communications.''\n\n\n\nAustralian law enforcement officials have complained that the growth of end-to-end encryption in applications such as Signal, Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger and Apple's iMessage could be the worst blow to intelligence and law enforcement capability in decades. Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said it hampers criminal investigations at all levels.\n\nApple argument\n\n\n\nBut Apple, in comments filed with parliament in October, argued that \"it would be wrong to weaken security for millions of law-abiding customers in order to investigate the very few who pose a threat.''\n\n\n\nThe company's iPhones, because of their strong encryption, are bulwarks of national security around the globe and help protect journalists, human rights workers and people living under repressive regimes.\n\n\n\n\"The iPhone is national security infrastructure right now,'' said Schneier. \"Every Australian legislator uses the systems and devices that that law will target, and making them insecure seems like a really bad idea.''\n\n\n\nApple also complained in October that the bill was \"dangerously ambiguous.''\n\n\n\nOne apparent contradiction confounds technologists. The legislation says the government \"must not require providers to implement or build systemic weaknesses in forms of electronic protection ('back doors')'' but also says it can \"require the selective deployment of a weakness or vulnerability in a particular service, device or item of software on a case-by-case basis.''\n\n\n\nTechnologists say that the mathematics underlying encryption and the way it\u2019s encoded into software make it impossible to decrypt a single user's communications without affecting all users.\n\n\n\nEric Wenger, director of cybersecurity and privacy policy for the U.S. technology giant Cisco Systems, warned during debate on the bill that Australia could be at a competitive disadvantage if its data were not regarded as secure.\n\n\n\nAustralia was a major driver of a statement agreed to at the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Germany last year that called on the technology industry to provide \"lawful and non-arbitrary access to available information'' needed to protect against terrorist threats."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Virginia Tech Students Unveil the House of the Future", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-tech-students-unveil-the-house-of-the-future/4689083.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Joseph Wheeler and his team of students and faculty from Virginia Tech University are convinced they are building the house of the future.\n\nJudges at the recent Solar Decathlon Middle East agreed, awarding their future house first place in the December competition held in Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe set it up in two days,\u201d Wheeler told VOA. \u201cAll the other teams took the full two weeks of construction.

Sign up for the weekly newsletter here.\n\nDear reader,\n\nA story from HuffPost U.S. this week looked at one of the key causes of gender pay disparities around the world: access to quality child care.\n\nIt focused on a report released Thursday, which found that 51 percent of Americans live in child care deserts, or areas with an insufficient supply of licensed child care. The lack of options, the report said, forces many parents (and mothers in particular) to sacrifice work to care for their children.\n\nJonathan Cohn, a senior national correspondent for HuffPost U.S., said he had a personal connection to the topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a working dad married to a working mom. We went through all of this when our children were little \u2014 figuring out how to adjust our respective careers, in order to be good parents, and how to make sure the kids were in a good environment when we weren\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were extraordinarily lucky, because we have lived in communities with plentiful supplies of high-quality child care \u2014 the kind you get overseas, in the countries that really emphasize it. But that\u2019s pretty rare here in the U.S., and it\u2019s driven me to write about why that is.\u201d\n\nThrough his years of reporting on both child care and health care, he said he has seen the ways in which the trend disproportionately affects women. \u201cHere\u2019s what we know for sure: A big part of the wage gap is that women are more likely to drop out of the workforce, to take care of kids, than men,\u201d he explained. \u201cMany of them return, but when they do, they have lost seniority or fallen behind peers \u2014 and never catch up. Obviously this is a choice some women are making, but it can also be a choice forced upon them, in one way or another.\u201d\n\nOne reason for this, he said, is that we still live in a society in which men aren\u2019t doing their share. \u201cThat seems to be more about culture than policy. But there are other factors pushing women out of the workforce, even when they\u2019d rather stay in it, and one of those is the high cost \u2014 and generally low quality \u2014 of child care,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicy can definitely fix that. It\u2019s just a matter of commitment and resources.\u201d\n\nHis article describes the sort of policies that could fix the problem, but it paints a pretty bleak picture of the tough choices most American parents must make in the meantime.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nFor more about U.S. health care, social welfare and politics, follow HuffPost U.S. Senior National Correspondent @CitizenCohn.

Police were mounted on horses and surrounded protesters with trained dogs. A ring of steel surrounded the Elysee Palace itself, as police stationed trucks and reinforced steel barriers in streets throughout the entire neighborhood.\n\nAssociated Press reporters witnessed multiple protesters hurt in Saturday\u2019s clashes with police. Paris police said 30 people were injured, including three police officers. An AP video journalist was wounded in the leg as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on the Champs-Elysees.\n\nSome stores along the Champs-Elysee had boarded up their windows with plywood, making the neighborhood appear like it was bracing for a hurricane. Angry protesters on Saturday tried to rip the boards off.\n\nProtesters threw flares and other projectiles and set fires but were repeatedly pushed back by tear gas and water cannon. By mid-afternoon, more than 700 people had been stopped and questioned, and more than 400 were being held in custody, according to a Paris police spokeswoman.\n\nDespite the repeated skirmishes, Saturday\u2019s anti-government protests appeared less chaotic and violent than a week ago, when crowds defaced the Arc de Triomphe, set vehicles ablaze and looted high-end stores in the city\u2019s worst rioting since 1968.\n\nPrized Paris monuments and normally bustling shopping meccas were locked down Saturday at the height of the holiday shopping season. The Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum were among the many tourist attractions that closed for the day, fearing damages amid a new round of protests. Subway stations in the center of town were shut down.\n\nThe yellow vest movement \u2014 named after the fluorescent outerwear French drivers must keep in their vehicles \u2014 started as a protest against higher taxes for diesel and gas, but quickly expanded to encompass wide frustration at stagnant incomes, the rising cost of living and other grievances.\n\nMacron on Wednesday agreed to abandon the fuel tax hike, which aimed to wean France off fossil fuels and uphold the Paris climate agreement, but that hasn\u2019t defused the anger.\n\nAfter two weekends of violence in Paris that made the authorities look powerless, police went into overdrive Saturday to keep a lid on unrest. Police frisked people or searched bags throughout central Paris, and confiscated gas masks and protective goggles from AP journalists.\n\nProtesters who came to Paris from Normandy described seeing officers block yellow-vested passengers from boarding public transportation at stops along their route.

So the protesters tried other routes, marching through the prime shopping district that includes the high-end stores of Galeries Lafayette and Printemps and the Palais Garnier opera house.\n\nNational police estimated the number of protesters in Paris on Saturday at 8,000, among 31,000 protesters nationwide. They appeared to be outnumbered by police, with 8,000 officers deployed in the capital alone and 89,000 fanned out around the country.\n\nThe yellow vests include people with views that range from the far right to the far left. The group has no leaders but is united in its feeling that Macron and his government are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary French families.\n\n\u201cWe are here to tell (Macron) our discontent. Me, I\u2019m not here to break things because I have four children so I am going to try to be safe for them, because they are afraid,\u201d protester Myriam Diaz told the AP. \u201cBut I still want to be here to say \u2018Stop, that\u2019s enough, this has to stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nCyril, a garbage truck driver in Normandy who earns 1,430 euros ($1,625) a month, said Macron\u2019s mistake was trying to reform France too quickly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have kids because I have trouble feeding myself, let alone another mouth,\u201d the 25-year-old told the AP, saying he came to Paris to demonstrate and \u201cdefend myself.\u201d\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner urged calm.\n\n\u201cI ask the yellow vests that want to bring about a peaceful message to not go with the violent people. We know that the violent people are only strong because they hide themselves within the yellow vests, which hampers the security forces,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\nFour people have been killed in accidents since the unrest began Nov. 17. Christmas markets, national soccer matches and countless other events have been canceled due to the protests.\n\nProtesters also blocked roads, roundabouts and tollbooths elsewhere in France. Offshoot movements have emerged elsewhere, and yellow-vest protests were held Saturday in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump sought to fuel the anger in France, seizing the moment to criticize the Paris climate accord, which he is abandoning.\n\n\u201cPeople do not want to pay large sums of money ... in order to maybe protect the environment,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMany economists and scientists, however, say higher fuel taxes are essential to saving the planet from worsening climate change.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Luxembourg Announces Plan To Become First Country To Make All Public Transportation Free", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luxembourg-public-transportation_us_5c08d6ace4b069028dc685ac", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "In an effort to reduce traffic congestion and the environmental impact of cars, Luxembourg has announced its plan to become the first country in the world to make all its public transportation free.\n\nThe European country\u2019s recently re-elected coalition government led by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has promised to lift fares on trains, trams and buses nationwide by summer 2019, The Guardian reported.\n\nAs the paper noted, however, some of the finer points of the plan have yet to be ironed out, including whether trains will still have first and second class compartments and if so, if riders will be charged in those cases.\n\nTraffic congestion is a major problem in Luxembourg, which receives approximately 170,000 cross-border commuters from neighboring France, Belgium and Germany on a daily basis.

In the aftermath of the fire in early November, animal rescuer Shayla Sullivan received a request to search for Gaylord\u2019s two dogs, Madison and his brother, Miguel. (Though some outlets have reported Sullivan is a volunteer with K9 Paw Print Rescue, which posted about her story on Facebook, she clarified that she is not affiliated with the group.)\n\nSullivan told HuffPost that when the fast-moving Camp Fire broke out, Gaylord had just minutes to escape and wasn\u2019t able to find Madison and Miguel.\n\nA different rescue worker managed to capture Miguel not long afterward, and he was ultimately reunited with Gaylord and her husband. But while Madison\u2019s whereabouts remained a mystery, Sullivan had a hunch he wasn\u2019t too far away. After all, some type of animal was eating the food and water she was regularly leaving out.\n\nAndrea Gaylord Madison looks out over the canyon.\n\n\u201cThe third day I went in there, I didn\u2019t know if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I felt like I saw a flash of white movement down in the canyon,\u201d she said.\n\nAs it turned out, Sullivan was right \u2015 but it took a familiar person coming home to convince Madison it was safe to show his face. When Gaylord drove up to the property the first day authorities allowed her back, it took \u201cabout five or 10 minutes\u201d for Madison to come bounding up to greet her, tail wagging.\n\n\u201cWhen Andrea showed up, he smelled\u201d her, Sullivan said.\n\nAndrea Gaylord\n\nEven more amazing was seeing Miguel and Madison reunite with each other. Miguel had been \u201cso upset and so depressed\u201d being without his brother and away from his home, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was surreal to see them go back into, like, \u2018We\u2019re a team now, everything is OK, we got our people, we can go back to work,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe dogs are currently staying on the property, with Gaylord\u2019s family making regular trips to make sure they\u2019re cared for. Sullivan emphasized that the pair are working dogs who need a lot of space. Gaylord and her family are living temporarily in a mobile home park, and having the dogs stay with them there, or in a kennel, is untenable.\n\n\u201cThese dogs are livestock guardian dogs, they do not do well in heat, they do not do well in small enclosures,\u201d she said. \u201cThey protect their property.\u201d\n\nMadison\u2019s devotion did not come as a surprise to Marlene Johnson, who owns Anatolian shepherds and founded the Facebook group Livestock Guardian Dogs and Positive Training Methods.\n\n\u201cAnatolian shepherd dogs are from Turkey and have been bred for thousands of years to protect and guard livestock, their property and their humans,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLivestock guardian dogs like Anatolian shepherds are working dogs that are appreciated for their loyalty, their intelligence and their independent nature and Madison is a perfect example of a livestock guardian dog.

Initiate a Code Red Lockdown,\u201d the message read, according to the Sentinel.\n\nThe message did not indicate that it was a drill, the Sentinel reported.\n\n\u201cThere was a campus disruption caused by a social media post,\u201d Daniel said, according to the WESH 2 audio. \u201cThe post indicated a possible threat to the campus.\u201d She added that the social media post was being investigated as a \u201cdisciplinary matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not yet know how the students got the screen shot that only goes to staff and are currently investigating that further,\u201d Lawrence wrote in the email.\n\nBut students had pointed to another incident that occurred during lunch hours later in the day that caused panic.\n\nLawrence confirmed to HuffPost that at some time after the drill, during lunchtime hours, an announcement was made over the loudspeaker saying that the earlier drill had been executed successfully.\n\nHowever the announcement included the words \u201ccode red,\u201d which is likely all some students heard in the noisy cafeteria, Lawrence said.\n\nIndeed, one student told WESH 2 in a video interview that he remembers hearing \u201ccode red\u201d over the loudspeaker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a code red, that\u2019s all it said \u2015 that\u2019s all I heard,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lunchtime announcement apparently sent some students frantically running out the doors.\n\nParents who received distraught text messages from their children at school have expressed disappointment on social media over the school\u2019s response time in informing parents that the \u201ccode red\u201d alert was just a drill.\n\nLawrence told the Sentinel that Lake Brantley\u2019s statement to parents informing them that there was not an emergency went out at least 30 minutes later than it should have.\n\nHe added that moving forward parents will be informed about future drills promptly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely going to be changes,\u201d he said.\n\nColleen Eskins, the mother of a student at Lake Brantley, told BuzzFeed News she\u2019s concerned about lasting effects from how these drills are conducted at schools.\n\n\u201cI understand that unfortunately we have to practice these drills for the safety of the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI am concerned about the psychological repercussions when \u2018active shooter\u2019 and \u2018not a drill\u2019 are communicated.\u201d\n\nLawrence told HuffPost that the district\u2019s \u201cbest practice\u201d is to have schools immediately contact parents to inform them when they conduct drills, but that on Thursday the message did not go out until approximately 11:19 a.m. He said the unannounced drill was otherwise held \u201cas normal\u201d with law enforcement.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the school\u2019s administration thought they had sent a message to their families at the conclusion of the drill as they typically do, but the message did not go out,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce families began calling local news media concerned if there was a drill or real incident, it was obvious the message about the event just being a drill obviously wasn\u2019t sent.\u201d\n\nLawrence noted that the district has also instructed all of its schools to not make such announcements during lunch hours, and to avoid using words \u201ccode red\u201d over school intercom systems.\n\nBob Kealing, a spokesman for the Seminole County Sheriff\u2019s Office, confirmed to HuffPost that the sheriff\u2019s office had left campus after it had completed the \u201ccode red\u201d drill, as it has \u201cmany times before\u201d in the district.\n\nKealing referred HuffPost to Daniel\u2019s statements for further comment.\n\nOn Friday, Daniel issued a statement to parents.\n\n\u201cI have spent the day debriefing with all parties involved in yesterday\u2019s events and I want to assure you that I\u2019m committed to taking action based on lessons learned from those debriefings,\u201d the principal said, according to the Sentinel."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Rep.

It means that Republicans do not believe that the Democratic Party can legitimately hold power. The GOP will use its power to enact last-minute laws to hurt Democratic constituencies and make it harder for Democrats to win power; if they somehow do, Republicans strip them of authority or prevent them from governing.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in,\u201d said Robin Vos, the Republican Speaker of the House in Wisconsin, as he explained why Republicans would gut the authority of incoming Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.\n\nFor Republicans, political power is now no different than an exclusionary childhood clubhouse: No Democrats allowed.\n\nThis policy effort to refuse Democrats power, at all costs, did not begin with the lame-duck session of 2018. What\u2019s happening now is a part of an ongoing process by Republicans in the courts and in elected office to increase power for their own wealthy interests, attack and divide Democratic Party constituencies and create voting obstacles that dilute equal representation.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A protestor holds a sign as Wisconsin Republicans strip the incoming Democratic governor of power during the 2018 lame duck session.\n\nCitizens United Turbocharged Republican Campaigns\n\nIn 2010, the five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices voted to legalize the use of unlimited corporate and union funds for independent election activities in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case. The decision upended two decades of precedent at the federal level and a century of precedent in some states.\n\nRepublican political operatives immediately took advantage of this new flood of money at the state level through an outside party group called the Republican State Legislative Committee. The group used newly allowed corporate money to fund an unprecedented campaign to win state legislatures and gain control of the redistricting process after the decennial census.\n\nTwo studies have shown that the Citizens United decision increased the number of state legislative seats won by Republicans in the 2010 election. One of those studies attributed at least a 10-point swing towards the Republican candidate due to the post-Citizens United spending in Michigan and North Carolina and at least a seven-point swing in Wisconsin.\n\nThe RSLC\u2019s efforts worked in tandem with billionaires interested in the various states. In Michigan, the DeVos family, rich off their Amway fortune, pumped newly allowed millions into outside groups to elect Republicans. Art Pope, a North Carolina multimillionaire, funneled his efforts into his own newly created network in North Carolina. And in Wisconsin, the billionaire Koch brothers of Kansas and local roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks spent huge amounts to elect Republican Gov. Scott Walker and a Republican legislature.\n\n\u2018Divide And Conquer\u2019\n\nThe next plan was to directly attack Democratic Party constituencies and funding sources, enact extreme gerrymanders to prevent the party from gaining power and make it harder to vote, especially for Democrats.\n\nWalker described part of this strategy to Hendricks just after he took office in 2011. Hendricks asked him whether he would destroy unions in Wisconsin to help make it a truly red-state. He replied he would move forward with legislation to gut public employee unions.\n\n\u201cYou just divide and conquer,\u201d Walker told Hendricks.\n\nWalker and the Republican legislature did just that and passed a bill gutting public employee unions over the objections of massive protests. The anti-union measure struck at the heart of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin. Public employee unions are a key piece in the coalition of interest groups that make up the party by providing organization and money.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Gov. Scott Walker (R) said he was trying to \"divide and conquer\" Wisconsin by gutting public employee unions in 2011.\n\nGut Labor Unions\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the end of the anti-union push. Walker and state Republicans successfully pushed to gut public employee unions by making Wisconsin a right-to-work state in 2015. Republicans in Michigan, the heart of the United Auto Workers, passed their own right-to-work law in 2013 devastating both public and private employee unions.\n\nThe Republican attack on unions was not just aimed at restoring the traditional hierarchical power structure of management over labor in the workplace, but also in decreasing union political influence and atomizing workers. The second point is important as unions provide a space for diverse groups of workers to meet, talk and organize in solidarity around their collective interests as a class. This makes it more likely that workers will embrace issues that unite them and their fellow workers in the workplace and not solely focus on the social issues that divide them.\n\nThe Republican attack on unions was not just aimed at restoring the traditional hierarchical power structure of management over labor in the workplace, but also in decreasing union political influence and atomizing workers.\n\nStudies have shown that the implementation of right-to-work laws and the subsequent drop in union membership correlates with a decrease in Democratic Party voting percentage. Not only do unions create solidarity across races and religion, but their get-out-the-vote efforts help increase the voting behavior of the poor, working class and African-American communities\n\nWalker\u2019s initial strike on unions, driven by a will to power and the interests of his biggest financial backers, led Democrats to call for recall elections of Walker and a spate of Republican legislators and judges.\n\nTo fight the recall efforts, Walker immediately ran back into the arms of the Citizens United decision. He reached out to his biggest donors with a scheme to save himself and his allies by funding efforts through an outside group. Walker flew around the country soliciting massive checks from the Republican billionaires for the unlimited outside group campaign, even though candidates are technically not supposed to coordinate with the independent political efforts legalized by the Supreme Court.\n\nA subsequent investigation into the alleged illegal coordination was shut down as by Republican judges who won their elections with support from Walker\u2019s outside group. Another Republican judge ruled Walker\u2019s scheme was legal under Citizens United and he applauded the maneuvers to evade campaign finance law. The Republican legislature later passed a law banning such future investigations, destroyed the state\u2019s election watchdog and legalized coordination with outside groups.\n\nTarget African-Americans \u2018With Surgical Precision\u2019\n\nAs this was going on the Republican-controlled legislatures in Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin all carefully gerrymandered their states to solidify control for at least the next decade.\n\nRepublicans plotted to minimize Democratic seats in Michigan by cramming \u201cDem garbage,\u201d as one staffer said in an email, into a minimal number of seats around the state\u2019s big cities. In Wisconsin, Republican legislators hired an outside law firm to conduct a secret redistricting process that created one of the most severe gerrymanders in state history. A three-judge court of appeals called the gerrymander drawn by North Carolina Republicans, \u201cthe most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim Crow.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rev. William Barber, President of the North Carolina Chapter of the NAACP, leads a Moral Monday protest against actions taken by the state's Republican legislature including enacting a racial gerrymander and limiting voting rights.\n\nThe North Carolina map was struck down in 2017 after Justice Clarence Thomas, the most conservative justice who is also the court\u2019s lone African-American, joined the Supreme Court\u2019s liberals in ruling that the state\u2019s Republicans violated the Voting Rights Act by constructing an illegal racial gerrymander harming the state\u2019s African-American population.\n\nAlthough the Voting Rights Act was held up by the court in this instance, the court struck down a key part of the landmark law in 2013. The Shelby County v. Holder decision was, like Citizens United before it, a partisan ruling whereby the court\u2019s five conservative justices \u2015 all appointed by Republicans \u2015 sharply limited the power of the federal government to implement the Voting Rights Act\u2019s election laws. This action allowed states with a history of discriminatory voting laws to bypass federal clearance for any new rules from the federal government absent a new formula being passed by Congress. Free from needing their laws cleared by the Justice Department, these states could now enact discriminatory laws with the only concern being a yearslong court challenge.\n\nNorth Carolina immediately enacted one of the most restrictive voting laws requiring voter identification, limiting early voting hours, ending same-day registration and implementing other new constraints. An appeals court ruled against this law claiming it was designed to \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision,\u201d but it remained in place through the 2014 election.\n\nAlthough Wisconsin is not covered by the formula invalidated by the Supreme Court Republicans, the state also enacted stringent voter restrictions, including onerous identification requirements. One in 10 voters in 2016 were blocked or disinclined from voting in the state because they didn\u2019t have or didn\u2019t think they had the proper identification, according to one University of Wisconsin study. The biggest decreases in voting due to the law appeared in cities with high African-American populations like in Milwaukee and students like in Madison.\n\nLame-duck Power Grabs\n\nNow, after all of these barriers to make it more difficult for Democrats to win any office failed, Republicans are declaring that only one party is allowed to govern.\n\nIn the current lame-duck session, Wisconsin Republicans stripped power from the incoming Democratic attorney general, removed some rule-making authority from the Democratic governor and blocked the governor from ending Walker\u2019s corrupt Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. They also restricted early voting hours and made it harder to end the work requirements they imposed on Medicaid recipients. These Republicans do all this because they view the votes of Democrats, particularly African-Americans, as illegitimate.\n\n\u201cIf you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority,\u201d Republican Speaker of the House Vos said after election night. \u201cWe would have all five constitutional officers, and we would probably have many more seats in the Legislature.\u201d\n\nNext door in Michigan, Republicans in legislature similarly moved to weaken the incoming Democratic governor, attorney general and secretary of state. To protect their big donors, they prevented the secretary of state\u2019s office from conducting oversight of campaign finance and elections. Incoming Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson campaigned on requiring disclosure of dark money in elections, but Republicans also made it illegal to require such disclosure. They also stripped the attorney general\u2019s office of the ability to intervene in lawsuits. Republicans also gutted a minimum wage law, a paid sick leave law and are looking to impose new restrictions on unions and attack environmental protections.\n\nBill Pugliano via Getty Images Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, won the election in November and now Republicans are stripping her of power before she comes into office.\n\nThese Republican legislatures are just copying what North Carolina Republicans did after losing the governorship in 2016. They gutted Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s power then and, after losing their supermajorities in the state House and Senate in 2018, are trying to gut even more now. Statehouse Republicans are now trying to pass a law that would prevent any board of elections in the state from having a majority of Democrats on it \u2015 a blatant attempt to tilt all future elections to Republicans. This comes as Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris faces extremely credible allegations that he rigged his own election through fraud.\n\nNo Democrats Allowed\n\nRepublican efforts to refuse power to Democrats are not restricted to the current states seeking to strip Democrats of power. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) refusal to hold hearings on former President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is a similar declaration that Democrats cannot wield power. Senate Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and then-Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) went even further saying that they would keep the Supreme Court at eight justices for four to eight years had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election rather than allow her to appoint any new justice. No Democrats allowed.\n\nThe ethos behind the \u201cDemocrats are unconstitutional\u201d process is that governance by non-Republicans is inherently corrupt. Democrats do not represent \u201creal Americans,\u201d as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin put it in 2008. You can see this in Speaker Vos\u2019 assertion that the votes of Madison and Milwaukee are less important, less noble than those of the rural and exurban (obviously the whiter) areas. When President Donald Trump speaks of \u201cdraining the swamp,\u201d he does not mean ending the influence of lobbyists or preventing elected officeholder from being paid directly by Saudi Arabia \u2015 quite the opposite. He means that Democrats, and the groups of people they represent, have been drained from power. Trump\u2019s closing pitch for the 2018 midterms was that Democrats represented \u201cmob rule,\u201d a form of inappropriate power meant to be opposed with obvious racial undertones.\n\nRed-State Redemption?\n\nAll of this points to the one thread that runs through all of these efforts to restrict politics and governance to Republicans: Each attempt to declare Democrats unconstitutional specifically attacks the power of African-Americans. African-Americans are heavily represented in public and private employee unions, suffer most from voting restrictions (particularly those designed with \u201csurgical precision\u201d to harm them) and contribute less money to campaigns than white Americans, nevermind powerful corporations.\n\nThe specific, sometimes clearly purposeful, harming of the interests of African-Americans echoes the most infamous era of democratic backsliding in American history. After the collapse of post-Civil War Reconstruction, Southern Democrats calling themselves \u201cRedeemers\u201d seized power in former Confederate states, often by violence, and ended black political power and freedom by imposing mandatory work laws that reinstituted slavery in all but name and gutting voting rights, among many other terrible things. The democratic backsliding that re-imposed white supremacy and one-party rule lasted for more than half-a-century."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Feds Investigating Millions Of Fake Messages Opposing Net Neutrality: Report", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feds-probe-fake-messages-to-fcc-supporting-ending-net-neutrality_us_5c0c4ae1e4b0ab8cf693ec5c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "The Justice Department is investigating possible criminal activity linked to millions of fake or duplicated messages \u2014 many from Russian email addresses \u2014 sent to the Federal Communications Commission opposing net neutrality, Buzzfeed reported Saturday.\n\nOf the 22 million messages sent last year to the FCC website, nearly 21 million were bots, organized campaigns or fakes, including many using stolen identities, according to a Stanford University study.

The announcement follows months of speculation that his tumultuous time in the Trump administration was drawing to a close.\n\n\ufeffTrump appointed Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, in July 2017 to replace Reince Priebus, who resigned as chief of staff after just six months in office. Kelly, 68, had been serving as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security at the time.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle had applauded Kelly\u2019s appointment as chief of staff, hoping his record of discipline could rein in the chaos that plagued the White House during Priebus\u2019 tenure.\n\nBut Kelly\u2019s reputation as a levelheaded straight shooter, earned over a decadeslong career in the military, began to erode within months of his installation, and his no-nonsense attitude did little to slow the revolving door of Trump administration officials.\n\nKelly reportedly offered to resign or threatened to quit his role several times before his departure.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at the most memorable moments of his White House tenure:\n\nOctober 2017: Bashes Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.)\n\nKelly came to Trump\u2019s defense in October 2017 after Wilson slammed the president for telling the wife of a fallen soldier that her husband \u201cmust\u2019ve known what he signed up for.\u201d\n\nKelly, whose son died serving in Afghanistan, told reporters that his son\u2019s commanding officer had said something similar.\n\n\u201cHe knew what he was getting himself into,\u201d Kelly said, quoting his son\u2019s commanding officer. \u201cIt was exactly where he wanted to be. That was the message.\u201d\n\nHe then attacked Wilson as \u201cselfish\u201d and falsely accused her of trying to take credit for securing federal funding for a new FBI building in Miramar, Florida, during its 2015 dedication ceremony.\n\nIn fact, Wilson drew bipartisan praise at the ceremony for pushing through legislation naming the buildings after two deceased FBI agents. Video of the event obtained by the Sun-Sentinel showed Wilson had taken credit for making sure the buildings were named after the agents \u2015 not for securing funding.\n\nDays later, Kelly told Fox News that he would \u201cnever\u201d apologize to Wilson.\n\nOctober 2017: Calls Robert E. Lee an \u201chonorable man\u201d\n\nKelly faced instant backlash after describing the Confederate general as an \u201chonorable man\u201d and blaming the Civil War on a failure to \u201ccompromise.\u201d The primary catalyst for the war was slavery, according to most historians.\n\n\u201cI would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man,\u201d Kelly had told Fox News. \u201cHe was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country. It was always loyalty to state first back in those days. Now it\u2019s different today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand,\u201d he added.\n\nJanuary: Criticizes Trump\u2019s border wall promise\n\nKelly told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that Trump wasn\u2019t \u201cfully informed\u201d when he promised voters during his 2016 presidential campaign that he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border if elected.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that Chief of Staff Kelly said today that the President\u2019s campaign was not fully informed about the wall he was promising to voters,\u201d Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.), who was present for the meeting, said in a statement. \u201cKelly went on to say that many campaigns are not fully informed about every policy and that campaigning and governing are two different things and that governing is harder,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez added.\n\nKelly\u2019s comments reportedly infuriated Trump, who tweeted that he \u201chas never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\u201d\n\nFebruary: Calls some Dreamers \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to apply for DACA\n\nImmigrant communities and their allies were incensed when Kelly claimed Trump\u2019s proposed immigration policy was generous because it would help some undocumented immigrants who may have previously been \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to seek protections.\n\nTrump had said he would support a path to citizenship for the 690,000 people protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, as well as for anyone who is eligible for the program but didn\u2019t sign up. The White House estimates that\u2019s 1.8 million people total.\n\n\u201cThe difference between 690 [thousand] and 1.8 million were the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn\u2019t sign up,\u201d Kelly said, according to The Washington Post.\n\nHe doubled down on his comments later in the day, telling reporters that people \u201cjust should have probably gotten off the couch and signed up.\u201d\n\nNEW: White House Chief of Staff John Kelly defends comment on people not signing up for DACA: \"I gotta say that some of them just should have probably gotten off the couch and signed up.\" https://t.co/6vGynH9tYS pic.twitter.com/QWbTWXL0iE \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 7, 2018\n\nFebruary: Defends Rob Porter amid domestic abuse allegations\n\nKelly reportedly offered his resignation to Trump after a series of missteps in handling domestic abuse allegations against then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported that Kelly knew about a protective order against Porter well before the aide resigned over allegations that he had abused his two ex-wives. On the day of Porter\u2019s resignation, Kelly released a glowing statement about him, crafted in part by then-White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, who was romantically involved with Porter at the time.\n\n\u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cHe is a friend, a confidante, and a trusted professional.

Instead, they were shown to be generally healthier than non-migrant populations and to contribute positively toward the nation\u2019s sustainable development.\n\nEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services.\" Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch\n\nIn the United States, specifically, research has found that immigrants payed more toward medical expenses than they withdrew, meaning they were a \u201clow-risk pool that subsidized the public and private health insurance markets,\u201d according to a Harvard Medical School and Tufts University report released in August. That same report also found that immigrants made up 12 percent of the population but only accounted for 8.6 percent of total U.S. health care spending.\n\nBut despite their contributions to the country, immigrants in the United States face significant barriers to health care. Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch, told HuffPost that legal immigrants often struggle to access health care due to a five-year delay in being able to apply for Medicaid, and because undocumented immigrants living in the United States often avoid preventive care for fear of deportation, ultimately relying on emergency health services. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health issue,\u201d she said.\n\nTerry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report and chair of Columbia University\u2019s Heilbrunn Department of Population & Family Health told HuffPost, \u201cOne interesting thing to note is that the immigrant health of Latinos, for example, often declines in the U.S. due to poor health care, health food, total lack of accessible mental health services.\u201d\n\nDespite accumulating evidence of health care needs among immigrant populations, the Trump administration continues to propose policies that could further restrict these communities\u2019 access to health services. In September, the administration proposed making it more difficult for immigrants who have enrolled for public benefits like Medicaid to either enter the U.S. or permanently stay here.\n\n\u201cEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services,\u201d McLemore said, adding that Human Rights Watch is set to release an extensive response to this proposal because \u201cit undermines all public health objectives that you can think of.\u201d\n\nMcLemore also said her organization is collecting anecdotal evidence that shows immigrants are already hesitant to enroll in public benefits programs for fear that the proposal may take effect.\n\n\u201cAll of this is going to become a serious public health problem because whenever you are denying people health services [or] reducing access to health services, you are increasing the risk to the public health,\u201d she said.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for refugees, asylum-seekers, and other displaced populations.\n\nAccording to the UCL-Lancet report, the majority of migrants that cross international borders worldwide are either students paying for their education or labor migrants who contribute to their host country\u2019s economy. A significantly smaller proportion of this population are individuals forced to leave their home countries due to persecution, conflict or disaster.\n\nHowever, this small fraction of global migrants \u2015 refugees and displaced populations, of which nearly 53 percent are children \u2015 have the highest risk of exploitation, disease and death because they usually lack access to equitable health services in their home country and initially live in cramped refugee camps or shelters with substandard health services when they first arrive in their host country.\n\nIn the United States, this narrative can be seen playing out along the U.S.-Mexico border, where asylum-seekers crossing into the country are often placed in crowded detention centers where adults and children face an increased risk of disease transmission and mental health consequences.\n\nData on immigrants detained in the United States is hard to come by, but human rights advocates have worked diligently to put together a picture of what health care for these communities look like. A Human Rights Watch report released in June had independent medical experts analyze 15 cases of immigrant deaths in detention from December 2015 to April 2017. In eight of the cases, physicians found \u201cinadequate\u201d medical care had \u201clikely\u201d contributed to the immigrants\u2019 deaths.\n\nWhile these deaths represent a fraction of the tens of thousands of immigrants in federal custody \u2015 including nearly 13,000 children, according to The New York Times \u2015 the HRW report said the fact that the deaths were due to \u201cbotched\u201d emergency responses and \u201cpoor quality of care\u201d by officers and medical staff raised serious concerns.\n\n\u201cHuman Rights Watch has documented and continues to document inadequate health care in detention and that situation is just getting worse as the numbers of those detained increase and the facilities are overcrowded and are inadequately staffed,\u201d McLemore said, adding that the UCL-Lancet report only confirms what their research has shown in the U.S. for years.\n\nMcGovern said the discrimination and restrictions that migrants and asylum seekers face in the United States because of their status leave them vulnerable to negative health outcomes. Not to mention, restricting access to preventive care could mean a higher long-term financial burden on the country.\n\nPreventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or ... putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive. Terry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report\n\n\u201cI think this report firmly establishes that preventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or separating families so that children are traumatized or putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAll of those things are just going to ultimately cause more catastrophic health problems.\u201d\n\nThe solution, as far as the UCL-Lancet commission is concerned, is for governments like the United States to implement policies that give all migrants universal and equitable health care.\n\n\u201cWhen people are excluded from health services, they don\u2019t seek care \u2015 that means that chronic diseases and other conditions go untreated or unaddressed,\u201d Tessema said. \u201cThat has long-term consequences for the individuals and for the health system overall, which has to now care for people who would have otherwise been treated earlier with simpler and more cost-effective means.\u201d\n\nMcLemore agrees: \u201cLong term, when you have people either avoiding health care or going to emergency services when they get very ill \u2015 that\u2019s the most costly kind of health care there is.\u201d\n\nBut for McGovern, it\u2019s clear that neither health costs nor public health concerns are what\u2019s currently driving U.S. immigration policy."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Humans Are Pooping Plastic, And No One\u2019s Certain How Bad That Is", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plastics-and-human-health_us_5c097d7de4b0b6cdaf5d3263", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "When Philipp Schwabl asked eight healthy people on four continents to take part in an experiment to see if plastic was present in their bodies, he had little idea what to expect.\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna researcher, who specializes in stomach disorders, asked them to keep a food diary for a week and record whether they had drunk water from plastic bottles, what brands of toothpaste and cosmetics they had used, and whether they had chewed gum. None were vegetarian, all had consumed plastic-wrapped food and most had consumed fish.\n\nThey were then asked to send a piece of their stool to an Austrian government laboratory where it was tested to identify barely visible microplastic particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters long.\n\nThe study, published in August, confirmed for the first time that microplastics are deep inside humans. All eight volunteers were found to have particles of most of the nine most common classes of plastics, including polypropylene and PET. On average, Schwabl found 20 particles per 10 grams of stool.\n\n\u201cI did not think all the samples would be positive,\u201d Schwabl said. \u201cThere is data on microplastics being present in shrimps, fish, oysters and mussels, but there was a question over whether they were present in humans. It is highly likely that during various steps of food processing or as a result of packaging, food is being contaminated with plastics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe smallest particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system and may even reach the liver,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need further research to understand what this may mean for human health.\u201d\n\nA clutch of studies looking at large plastic fragments in oceans has recently shown the world\u2019s most ubiquitous material to be present from the poles to the equator and to be a growing environmental hazard. Plastic in marine environments is now widely recognized to be a threat to many marine species.\n\nThe new awareness of plastic pollution is leading scientists to ask afresh how much the human body is being polluted.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Global plastic production has increased from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and is expected to triple by 2050.\n\nStudies have found plastic fibers and fragments present throughout the food chain, in plankton and fish larvae, bottled and tap water, seafoods, honey and salt.\n\nOne analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water. One widely sold brand had concentrations of about 10,000 particles per liter, and only 17 of the 259 bottles contained water that was free of plastic.\n\nOther research has shown plastic particles shed from degrading car tires present in the air we breathe in the street, in homes from the washing of synthetic clothes, and in the soil via sludge from water treatment works that is used as a fertilizer.\n\nWith global plastic production increasing from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and expected to triple by 2050, research is needed to gauge what effect growing human exposure to it may be having, say scientists.\n\n\u201cPlastic is non-degradable. It cannot be broken down and has the potential to persist in our bodies for a lifetime after exposure,\u201d said Stephanie Wright, a researcher at University College London who specializes in microscopic plastic pollution.\n\nConcern is growing that many man-made chemicals added to consumer plastics to give them qualities like stiffness or transparency may contain hormone-altering chemicals that have barely been tested. According to one study, detectable levels of bisphenol A, one of a group of toxic chemicals, have been found in the urine of 95 percent of the adult population of the U.S.\n\nPeople working in the textile industry have been shown to develop lung disease after exposure to nylon (plastic) flock, said Wright. \u201cContinuous daily interaction with plastic allows oral, dermal [skin] and inhalation exposure to chemical components. The potential for microplastics and nanoplastics so small they cannot be seen by the naked eye to cause harm to human health remains understudied,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Warhurst, director of European chemical watchdog group CHEM Trust, has, with academics, identified over 4,000 chemicals potentially present in plastic packaging, of which 63 have been identified as dangerous to human health because of their potential to disrupt hormones.\n\njapatino via Getty Images One analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water.\n\n\u201cMany chemicals used in plastics have not been tested for their endocrine-disrupting effects,\u201d Warhurst said. \u201cCurrent test methods are not very good at identifying all of them.\u201d\n\nSome of the most common are bisphenols and phthalates, used in everything from food packaging and toys to floor tiles and water bottles. They have been connected to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even cancers.\n\nMany countries have either banned bisphenol A or advised that it may be dangerous to children. The United States\u2019 National Toxicology Program has \u201csome concern\u201d for bisphenol A\u2019s effect on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and children. It is still used widely in Europe.\n\nBut other bisphenols and phthalates are not banned and are used frequently in the production of consumer goods. Many, said Warhurst, may be similar or even more toxic than those banned.\n\n\u201cA lot of chemicals are very similar to known endocrine disruptors. When one gets banned, there are others behind it. Chemical companies are required to provide data but it\u2019s not always comprehensive. There is no strict enforcement and companies can bring chemicals onto the market easily. More research is needed and much better control,\u201d he said.\n\nOther scientists have said the danger to human health, if any, may be in the smallest pieces, or nanoplastics. \u201cMicroplastics will not enter a cell, but nanoplastics are small enough to cross into cells and permeate the body,\u201d said Anne Marie Mahon, a researcher at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Ireland. Her recent research found sludge in water treatment works full of microparticles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that chemicals could be absorbed in our circulatory system or pass into our organs. But whether that is happening is unknown,\u201d Mahon said.\n\nIn sufficient concentrations, chemicals can injure and kill cells in the human body, said Frank Kelly, chair of environmental health at King\u2019s College London and one of Britain\u2019s leading authorities on air pollution. He wrote with Stephanie Wright: \u201cThe cells may be replaced successfully or they may not. If inhaled or ingested, microplastics may accumulate and exert localized toxicity by inducing an immune response. \u201d\n\nTheir research is backed by Philipp Schwabl in Austria. \u201cIn animals, some microparticles have been found in the liver and embedded in tissue,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on the amount, this could cause immune reactions. It\u2019s possible that the minutest particles are in the human blood and tissue but it\u2019s very hard to measure and we cannot prove it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urgently need more research,\u201d he added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Dwyane Wade Slams Critics Saying Gabrielle Union Was Acting Like She Gave Birth", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gabrielle-union-dwayne-wade-baby-controversy_us_5c0ae35ae4b035a7bf5b16e1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "In an interview with Oprah Winfrey set to air Dec. 8, actress Gabrielle Union and her husband, NBA star Dwyane Wade, shared how hurt they were when, after the birth of their daughter in November, commenters online ridiculed Union for posting photos of herself practicing what\u2019s known as skin-to-skin contact, or kangaroo care.\n\nThe set of two photos, which she shared on Instagram on Nov. 8, show Union and Wade holding their baby, Kaavia James, who was carried by a surrogate.\n\n\u201cI think for me the most hurtful thing was once we had our baby and everybody started talking about \u2018Why is she in the bed holding the baby? Why she got a gown on? Why she acting like she just had a baby?\u2019\u201d said Wade. \u201cAnd once again, people are uneducated on the process and why we decided to go skin to skin as soon as our baby came out.\u201d\n\nIn skin-to-skin contact, parents hold their naked baby to their chest against their bare skin. Research shows that this kind of embrace soon after birth helps calm and soothe the baby; regulate the infant\u2019s temperature, heart rate and breathing; improve the blood glucose levels in newborns; and lower pain levels in babies. It can also help babies sleep better and give parents and child a chance to bond emotionally. And those benefits are especially crucial for babies born prematurely.\n\nFor parents like Wade and Union, who needed the help of a surrogate, the skin-to-skin contact takes on additional importance, said Dr. Shannon M. Clark, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and an associate professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston who was not involved in the pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe importance of skin to skin for intended parents is that the immediate benefits that can happen with the mom who just gave birth to her baby would be the same for an intended parent who didn\u2019t give birth to a baby,\u201d said Clark. \u201cBeing able to do that as an intended parent \u2015 it\u2019s ideal.\u201d\n\nShe bristled at the accusation that Union was acting as though she just gave birth, noting that wearing a hospital gown with an open front is the easiest way to accomplish skin-to-skin contact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone who does that is trying to pretend that they gave birth,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s just for ease of use and ease of access in order to facilitate adequate skin to skin.\u201d\n\nUnion, who was diagnosed with adenomyosis, suffered eight or nine pregnancy losses (she lost count) before deciding to use a surrogate.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the couple entered into a traditional surrogacy, in which the woman who carries the pregnancy uses her egg to conceive the child, or a gestational surrogacy, in which the gestational carrier is pregnant with the intended parents\u2019 embryo.\n\n\u201cSometimes people use donor sperm. Sometimes people use donor eggs. Sometimes it is the couple\u2019s own embryo,\u201d Union explained in another part of the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s all different kinds of routes to that. Whether the couple opts to share that with you should be on them.\u201d\n\nKaavia James was born Nov. 7.\n\nDr. Lisa Erickson, a retired reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist in Minnesota who has experience helping people build their family through surrogacy, said skin-to-skin contact is one of several ways that intended parents can bond with their baby.\n\n\u201cSome [intended parents] can be present at delivery, [and] some cannot,\u201d she said. \u201cKangaroo care is just one method to feel the experience of closeness.\u201d\n\nErickson said the bonding between intended parents and child can start even before birth, with the intended parents and the surrogate bonding with each other. For instance, she said, it isn\u2019t uncommon for the surrogate to keep a journal throughout the pregnancy and give that diary to the intended parents.\n\nClark mentioned that additional kinds of bonding can help intended parents bond with their baby during pregnancy, for example, by attending prenatal checkups to keep updated on milestones and letting the surrogate know what music and children\u2019s books the family plans to share with the baby so that the surrogate can begin listening and reading out loud to the fetus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit different for every couple and for every matched intended parent and a [surrogate], but there are ways to facilitate the bonding,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the hope is that once the baby is here, skin to skin, being involved with the labor and delivery process and being there for the surrogate or gestational carrier is the most important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to build a family, and this is just one of them,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift of unmeasurable love.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Could Prescription Heroin Help Stem Opioid Deaths In The U.S.?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prescription-heroin-opioid-deaths_us_5c0809bae4b0844cda4f5196", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Yahoo Canada News A tray of supplies at the Insite supervised injection clinic in Vancouver, Canada, where people are permitted to inject illicit drugs in the presence of medical staff.\n\nAs drug overdose deaths in the United States soar and life expectancy drops, researchers are looking to unconventional approaches to help stem the nation\u2019s opioid crisis \u2015 including making heroin available by prescription.\n\nA report released by the nonprofit Rand Corporation this week analyzed the literature on two interventions \u2015 prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites \u2015 that already exist in Europe, Canada and Australia, but are still highly controversial in the United States.\n\nWhile prescribing one of the drugs at the center of the opioid crisis might seem unthinkable to the uninitiated, Beau Kilmer, lead author of the new report and the co-director of Rand\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center, explained that it can be an effective way to keep drug users safe if traditional treatments haven\u2019t worked for them.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just legalizing heroin or giving it out,\u201d he said, stressing that prescription heroin isn\u2019t a first-line treatment. Instead, heroin-assisted therapy involves offering pharmaceutical-grade heroin to people who have tried other treatments, such as methadone, and continued to inject. That dose of heroin would be used under medical supervision in a clinic, often with the option of taking methadone home to ward off potential withdrawal.\n\nThe researchers analyzed randomized controlled trials on prescription heroin in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and found strong evidence to support that drug users who were prescribed heroin were less likely to use illicit street heroin. Unlike prescription heroin, street heroin carries the risk of being adulterated with other substances, such as fentanyl, the highly potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the nearly 50,000 opioid deaths the U.S. logged in 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that people who received prescription heroin had better social and mental health outcomes and were less likely to engage in criminal activity than those who received methadone.\n\n\u201cFor these individuals, not only does it reduce their use of street-source heroin, but it also helps stabilize their lives,\u201d said Kilmer, who explained many people who have been using drugs for an extended period of time spend a significant portion of the day trying to get money to pay for heroin, potentially putting themselves in dangerous situations.\n\nThe report concluded that it\u2019s time for the U.S. to pilot prescription heroin.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of these programs in other countries, and given where we are in the United States with fentanyl poisoning, we definitely think that there should be randomized controlled trials of heroin-assisted treatment in the United States,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nThe new report found less robust evidence behind supervised consumption sites \u2015 where people bring their own street drugs to inject, using clean supplies in a hygienic clinical setting under medical supervision.\n\nAlthough previous research on existing supervised consumption sites outside of the U.S. found that these sites reduced disease transmission and drove down emergency calls and fatal overdoses, the new report concluded that there were too few studies, from a limited number of locations, to draw rigorous conclusions from.\n\nOn the other hand, Kilmer pointed out that those supervised consumption sites have been in existence for between 15 and 30 years, and have withstood multiple changes in national and local government. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sites are effective, but it does suggest that if they have negative effects, they\u2019re minor ones.\n\n\u201cIf there really was a significant downside for the individuals or the communities, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to have such longevity,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nCultural and legal obstacles stand in the way.\n\nHeroin is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning there\u2019s no accepted medical use for it and doctors can\u2019t prescribe it. Human research on Schedule I drugs is permitted, but similar to the obstacles medical marijuana researchers run up against, prescription heroin researchers would encounter barriers, such as having to get research approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe new report suggests a workaround. It would be easier to start a pilot program on injectable hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid used for pain in the United States. There\u2019s less research on injectable hydromorphone than there is on prescription heroin. Still, the limited research that does exist suggests that like prescription heroin, supervised injectable hydromorphone could have physical and mental health benefits and reduce illicit street drug use, potentially making it a viable \u2015 and less stigmatized \u2015 alternative to prescription heroin, with far fewer regulatory hoops.\n\n\u201cThis is a drug already being widely used [in medical settings] in the U.S., so would be simply an incremental adjustment,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. (Although Beletsky was not involved in the report, he did give the authors feedback on it.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more realistic to call for that approach,\u201d he added.\n\nSupervised consumption pilot sites face their own legal obstacles. Although the sites are being considered in more than a dozen U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia, a federal law known as the \u201ccrack house statute\u201d makes it illegal to use or distribute a controlled substance, and the Justice Department has threatened to crack down on any site that does open.\n\nI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s. Robert Heimer, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health\n\nMany jurisdictions seem skittish about the potential pilots. In October, California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation that would have authorized the nation\u2019s first pilot program in San Francisco, although it remains to be seen what will happen when Democratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is sworn in next year.\n\n\u201cI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s, and take some risks,\u201d said Robert Heimer, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report.\n\n\u201cThese are as much practical implementations as they are scientific. Sometimes waiting for the science to provide conclusive evidence of anything really means missed opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no compelling evidence against, and there\u2019s logical reasons why these things might be expected to work, then just go with it,\u201d Heimer added.\n\nBut prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites were never intended to work in isolation. Instead, they are potential pieces of a much larger, multipronged approach to addressing the crisis.\n\nWhile a handful of big cities eye supervised consumption sites as an additional tool in their opioid crisis toolbox, much of the country lacks more basic harm reduction services. There are still few needle exchange programs in the U.S., particularly in rural areas of the country, and large gaps in access to addiction treatment.\n\nAs it stands, only 12 percent of people with substance use disorder received speciality treatment, according to a 2016 surgeon general report, despite decades of evidence showing that treatments like methadone and buprenorphine are effective. And even less controversial harm reduction strategies, like needle exchanges and the opioid overdose antidote naloxone, still aren\u2019t as widely available as they should be.\n\n\u201cRural counties are at high risk for problems,\u201d but they need more fundamental harm reduction strategies in place before trying to create supervised consumption sites, Heimer said. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the cities that are more practical first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasing access to methadone and buprenorphine must remain a top priority,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cIf you are talking about places that don\u2019t have methadone or don\u2019t have syringe exchange programs, I don\u2019t think it would make much sense to argue for these other types of interventions, which could be even more controversial.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported.

He was charged with violating campaign finance laws stemming from money used to hide his pregnant lover, but a trial ended in 2012 with an acquittal on one charge and a mistrial on five others.\n\nMr. Giuliani pointed to that outcome on Saturday to argue that the president should not be similarly charged.\n\n\u201cThe President is not implicated in campaign finance violations because based on Edwards case and others the payments are not campaign contributions,\u201d Mr. Giuliani wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo responsible prosecutor would premise a criminal case on a questionable interpretation of the law.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty under that interpretation of the law, and even if Mr. Trump cannot be charged while in office, the House could still investigate or even seek to impeach him. The framers of the Constitution specifically envisioned impeachment as a remedy for removing a president who obtained office through corrupt means, and legal scholars have long concluded that the threshold of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d does not necessarily require a statutory crime.\n\nIf the campaign finance case as laid out by prosecutors is true, Mr. Nadler said, Mr. Trump would be likely to meet the criteria for an impeachable offense, and he said he would instruct his committee to investigate when he takes over in January.\n\nBut he added that did not necessarily mean that the committee should vote to impeach Mr. Trump. \u201cIs it serious enough to justify impeachment?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat is another question.\u201d\n\nThe strategy of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers has been predicated on the assurance by senior Justice Department officials that if Mr. Mueller found evidence that the president broke the law, he would not be indicted while in office.

He revealed to them that he talked with Mr. Trump about meeting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during Mr. Putin\u2019s trip to New York for a United Nations session in September 2015. That was three months after Mr. Trump had declared his candidacy for president, at a time when Mr. Cohen was aggressively pursuing the building of a Trump hotel in Moscow that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the Trump Organization.\n\nAfter conferring with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said, he reached out \u201cto gauge Russia\u2019s interest in such a meeting.\u201d It ultimately did not take place.\n\nTwo months later, Mr. Cohen said, he was approached by a Russian claiming to be a \u201c\u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation.\u201d The individual, who was not named, offered \u201csynergy on a government level\u201d with the Trump campaign.

Now, he\u2019s gone back to people he knows. They\u2019re on his team, and that\u2019s what is needed.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Ayers is already a divisive figure in the Trump orbit. When it became clear that Mr. Trump, who has an unusual affinity for Mr. Ayers, was leaning toward him to replace Mr. Kelly, several top aides told the president that they took issue with it and that it could lead to a staff exodus.\n\nIf Mr. Ayers accepts the job, his appointment would be seen inside the White House as a coup for Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who clashed with Mr. Kelly and are seen as close to Mr. Ayers. The view inside is that they are now \u201crunning the building,\u201d one of the president\u2019s allies said.\n\nMr. Kelly had long complained that Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, both top advisers to the president, were \u201cplaying government.\u201d He had repeatedly tried to limit their influence amid complaints from others in the West Wing that they did not operate within the system.\n\nWhen Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, entered the White House in July 2017 with the goal of instilling order in a disorderly West Wing, he lent a patina of respectability to a White House that at the time was staffed almost entirely by people who had never before served in government.\n\nDespite his imposing military credentials, however, Mr. Kelly slowly realized the futility of trying to control the president, and ultimately resigned himself to a stalemate of coexistence, simply letting Trump be Trump and complaining to his colleagues about how miserable he was in the job. In the past year, he has often come to work late and left early, telling colleagues, \u201cI\u2019m leaving and I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d\n\nHis overt dissatisfaction meant that no one in the White House ever expected him to stand by a statement he issued earlier this year to quell the constant rumors of his impending departure. While he said at the time that he would remain in the job through the re-election campaign in 2020, Mr. Trump himself told allies that he expected Mr. Kelly to be around only through the midterm elections."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "These Are the Generals Who\u2019ve Left the White House", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000005982803/trump-generals-resign-kelly-mattis-flynn-mcmaster.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The President Be Impeached?\u2019 We Answer Your Questions"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Cory Booker Dips a Toe Into New Hampshire as 2020 Decision Nears", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/politics/cory-booker-2020.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "In a brief interview, Mr. Booker said he understood the desire among some Democrats for a more confrontational and combative tone in the Trump era. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of folks who may have an appetite for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not who I am, and I will continue to try to be as fearlessly authentic as I can.\u201d\n\nWill Mr. Booker\u2019s approach work? \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Booker has already carried his message to 24 states during the 2018 midterms, including the four that kick off the presidential nominating contest, campaigning for more than 40 candidates and raising more than $7 million for Democratic causes and campaigns, according to his aides. His New Hampshire swing is the last one on the calendar before his self-imposed timeline to make a final decision about running for president.\n\nBack home, state lawmakers have cleared the path for Mr. Booker\u2019s run. In November, the New Jersey governor signed a law that allows Mr. Booker to seek both the presidency and re-election to the Senate in 2020.\n\nThere is certainly interest in Mr. Booker: The fire marshal cut off access to Mr. Booker\u2019s speech at the state party\u2019s celebration on Saturday (though the room did not seem particularly full), sending extra people to a nearby overflow room.\n\nAccompanied on Saturday by three aides, Mr. Booker is further along in his New Hampshire outreach than some other would-be candidates. He and his team are reaching out to potential staff, and Mr. Booker has made calls to winners in the midterm elections, which saw Democrats take over both chambers of the State Legislature. Both new legislative leaders got personal calls from Mr. Booker.\n\nStill, few are making any commitments in what is expected to be a crowded field of more than a dozen candidates that could include liberal senators from two neighboring states: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "What These Medical Journals Don\u2019t Reveal: Top Doctors\u2019 Ties to Industry", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/health/medical-journals-conflicts-of-interest.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "For example, the American Association for Cancer Research has warned authors that they face a three-year ban if they are found to have omitted a potential conflict.

(But those plans aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway.\n\nPeople are signing up for Medicaid instead\n\nThe state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state\u2019s recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that.\n\nOther states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law.\n\nMore people have jobs\n\nAs the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it\u2019s probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage.\n\nFor some people, the plans are less affordable\n\nPrices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price.\n\nLast year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid th emselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage.\n\nThis year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places \u2014 and people may not be able to find a free plan this year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Drug Maker Pays $360 Million to Settle Investigation Into Charity Kickbacks", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/actelion-johnson-and-johnson-kickback-medicare.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-09 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation. Tracleer, which is prescribed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, sells in pharmacies for an average cash price of about $14,500 for 60 tablets, according to the website GoodRx.\n\nCaroline Pavis, a spokeswoman for Actelion, said in a statement that the company was committed to complying with the law. It admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson & Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.\n\nDrug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance. These payments are not just about benevolence \u2014 they also help blunt the outrage over rising drug prices by limiting how much patients have to pay. Insurers then cover most of the cost.\n\nBut federal anti-kickback laws prohibit companies from giving such financial assistance to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because doing so is considered an inducement to buy their drugs. For years, drug makers have skirted those laws by instead donating to nonprofit charities, which then give the money to Medicare patients. Such arrangements are legal as long as there is no direct coordination between the pharmaceutical company and the nonprofit organization.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Actelion violated the law by collecting detailed data in 2014 and 2015 about the patients receiving help from a nonprofit, the Caring Voice Coalition, and using the data to budget for future donations. As a result, Actelion ensured that the money it donated would be used only to assist patients who used its drugs, and not competing companies\u2019 treatments for the pulmonary condition."}]
