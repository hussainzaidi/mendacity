Orrin Hatch of Utah lamented in his farewell speech delivered on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill , who was defeated in the November midterm elections, echoed that idea when she delivered her own farewell speech . \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was worried about this place,\" she said. \"It just doesn't work as well as it used to.\"\n\n\"Something is broken,\" the Missouri Democrat went on to say. \"If we don't have the strength to look in the mirror and fix it, the American people are going to grow more and more cynical.\"\n\nAs senators who were either ousted in the elections or decided to retire and not seek another term reflected on their time in Congress, many expressed dismay at how divided Washington has become as lawmakers retreat to entrenched partisan positions that leave little room for compromise or common ground.\n\nMost of them spoke in the final weeks of the year, a time largely overshadowed by a flurry of last-minute legislative activity and an unsuccessful effort to stave off a partial government shutdown. But the shuttering of roughly 25% of the federal government appeared to help illustrate a common sentiment conveyed during many of these farewell speeches: that something would need to change for Washington to function properly.\n\n'This is not a normal time'\n\nMcCaskill and Hatch weren't the only ones sounding alarm bells.\n\n\"To say that our politics is not healthy is somewhat of an understatement,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake said in his farewell speech . \"I believe that we all know well that this is not a normal time and that the threats to our democracy from within and without are real.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump , went beyond a critique of American politics to say he believes an \"authoritarian impulse\" is experiencing a resurgence worldwide and that the \"global commitment to democracy seems now to be on somewhat shaky ground.\"\n\nBut while departing senators had unique messages to impart, the overarching idea that there's a problem with the current state of politics was a consistent theme.\n\n\"What in the world has happened to civility and to humility in our nation's public discourse?\" Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who lost his seat in the midterms, asked in his farewell speech.\n\n\"Tribalism is our problem, and if not corrected, it's going to take our country down,\" he warned.\n\nYear marked by 'loss of comity'\n\nThe farewell speeches came as the most recent session of Congress drew to a close in late December -- a session that has been punctuated by a series of bitterly contentious fights on Capitol Hill.\n\nTensions ran high between Democratic and Republican senators during the confirmation hearings. In one dramatic moment, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina accused his Democratic colleagues of trying to \"destroy\" Kavanaugh's life for political gain.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters 00:42\n\nIn the end, only one Republican -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- opposed the nomination, while just one Democrat -- Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- sided with Senate Republicans to elevate Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nHatch said during his farewell speech that \"many factors contribute to the current dysfunction,\" but added, \"If I were to identify the root of the crisis it would be this: the loss of comity and genuine good feeling among Senate colleagues.\"\n\nIn yet another sign of division between the two parties, 2018 started off with a government shutdown at the end of January and ended with another fight in December, when a standoff between Trump and Democrats over funding for a border wall triggered a partial shutdown that began just days before Christmas\n\nDon't be afraid of 'tough votes' and other advice\n\nAs departing senators outlined concerns in their farewell speeches, many described what they believe has contributed to the highly divisive political climate and what they think needs to change.\n\nMcCaskill urged lawmakers to have the courage to take \"tough votes.\"\n\n\"Solving the toughest problems will not happen without tough votes,\" she said. \"We can talk about the toughest problems ... we can argue about them, we can campaign on them, but we're not going to solve them without tough votes.\"\n\nNelson and outgoing Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who also lost his seat in the midterms, suggested that an influx of big money in politics has had a corrosive effect, making an argument common to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The court's 2010 decision opened the floodgates and allowed the wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections and corrupt our democracy,\" Nelson said, referring to the landmark 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn his farewell speech, Donnelly said that \"the divisive rhetoric, the political campaigns, increasingly funded by tens of millions of dollars, anonymous, dark money interests is really doing damage to this country.\"\n\nNelson argued that another issue is the \"constant attempts to disenfranchise voters and make it more difficult for every American to have their voice heard at the ballot box.\"\n\nHatch, meanwhile, decried \"identity politics,\" a concept often invoked critically by Republicans, who frequently accuse Democrats of subscribing to it.\n\n\"We must reject the politics of division, starting with identity politics,\" the Utah Republican said, adding that \"identity politics is nothing more than dressed-up tribalism. It is the deliberate and often unnatural segregation of people into categories for political gain.\"\n\n'I love this place'\n\nIn their farewell speeches, departing senators also reflected on fond memories of their time in Congress, and some expressed optimism for the future despite their concerns.\n\n\"For all the problems I've outlined, know that I love this place,\" McCaskill said. \"We have fought, we have cried and we have laughed together. Just like family.\"\n\n\"For more than four decades, I have had the distinct privilege of serving in the United States Senate,\" Hatch said , adding, \"speaking on the Senate floor, debating legislation in committee, corralling the support of our colleagues on compromise legislation -- these are the moments I will miss. These are the memories I will cherish forever.\"\n\nHatch went on to say that \"to address this body is to experience a singular feeling: a sense that you are a part of something bigger than yourself, a minor character in the grand narrative that is America.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See Flake's goodbye speech on Senate floor Replay More Videos ...

He said, \"But many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall.\" On Thursday, he tweeted, \"Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?\"\n\nTrump offered no evidence that most of the 800,000 people working without pay or not working belong to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The federal government is an apolitical workforce comprised of hardworking veterans, law enforcement officers, scientists, analysts, janitors, nurses and many other civil servants all with diverse backgrounds and demographics,\" J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told CNN in a statement. \"A government shutdown doesn't hurt any one political party or any one federal employee more than another, it hurts all of them.\"\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees is a labor union that represents over 700,000 federal employees at several agencies.\n\nA representative of AFGE local chapter 1637, who is an employee at the Bureau of Prisons in Texas, said that she does not support the shutdown. The employee is considered \"essential,\" so she is working without pay during the shutdown.\n\n\"Personally, I'm like, what federal employees are you talking to? Because it's not people at my institution,\" she told CNN. \"None of us want the government shut down. None of us want to be working and not getting paid. Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, Green parties, all of us that work, at least at my facility, we want to get paid.\"\n\nThis federal employee works the overnight shift at her job. She is engaged and planning a July wedding. This week, she missed putting deposits down at her wedding reception venue and church. She also canceled an appointment to start getting her wedding dress made next week. She's worried that if she puts those payments down now, and the shutdown continues, she won't be able to pay her rent and other more pressing bills in the coming months.\n\n\"That's thousands of dollars that I can't just put out somewhere not knowing when I'm going to get paid again,\" she said. \"My well-being is not at stake, but my dreams and hopes for something in life are being fractured and highly possibly shattered.\"\n\nShe said that because some people are frustrated they are not getting paid and still have to work, they are not showing up to work. This means that she and some others at her facility are also working mandatory overtime during this period.\n\nShe expressed frustration with some of the comments being made by lawmakers in Washington.\n\n\"As federal employees, when statements are made, the effects and attitudes that respond from it are negative and frustration, because you are not in our shoes. You're not experiencing what we're experiencing,\" she said. \"If the shoe were on the other foot, if you took a day at my job, would you really feel like what you're doing right now is right?\"\n\nAcross the country, the Esparza family in Kent, Washington, along with some 42,000 other active duty Coast Guard members, will not be paid during the shutdown.\n\nThe Coast Guard is the only military branch that isn't paid during the government shutdown; they technically are part of the Department of Homeland Security. However, the Coast Guard announced Friday night that the administration has identified a way to ensure \"military members that served on active duty in the month of December and those reserve military members that drilled prior to the lapse in appropriation\" will get paid on December 31.\n\n\"This isn't our first rodeo,\" Jacqui Esparza says, but she's expecting it to be the worst one ever. Her husband, Joshua, has been in the Coast Guard for 14 years.\n\nNow, the Esparzas are trying to get a hold on what bills must be paid, and what can wait.\n\n\"First thing was we can get almost all the bills paid, but what are we going to do about rent, because our rent comes from my husband's pay, which includes housing allowance,\" she says. \"Without that we can't afford the Seattle area.\"\n\nEsparza estimates that they'll incur about $200 in late fees; money her family doesn't have -- especially after the holidays.\n\nThe pain doesn't stop in their bank accounts. Jacqui Esparza is mourning the loss of their grandfather.\n\nThe airfare cost is just another financial hit to their bank account.\n\n\"The politicians can bicker all the want on Capital Hill,\" she says. \"But stop using the military and their pay as a bargaining chip.\"\n\nShutdown stretches into second week\n\nWhile some federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Smithsonian museums were able to use other funds to remain open for the first week of the shutdown, as the shutdown enters week two, those funds have dried up.\n\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an email to agency staff on Dec. 27 informing them that if a shutdown deal was not reached by midnight on Dec. 28, the agency would begin orderly shutdown procedures. The Smithsonian announced that all museums, research centers and facilities, including the National Zoo, would close starting Jan. 2 if a shutdown deal was not reached.\n\nAt the National Zoo in Washington, DC, all animals will continue to be fed and cared for during the shutdown, but live animal cams, including the popular Panda Cam, would no longer broadcast once the zoo closes.\n\nAccording to the zoo's website, the cameras require \"federal resources, primarily staff, to run\" and are \"deemed non-essential.\"\n\nNational Parks across the country remain \"as accessible as possible,\" during the shutdown, according to an agency spokesperson. For some parks, state and city governments have stepped in to cover funding and keep them open.\n\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state would provide funding to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open. In Philadelphia, a local nonprofit organization, VISIT PHILADELPHIA, donated money to keep Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell open for three days starting Dec. 28.\n\n\"People come to New York, they come to see the sights, and it's important at this dark time in our country to keep the torch on the Statue of Liberty lit, metaphorically,\" Cuomo said on radio station WAMC on Dec. 27."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Defeated Democrat issues warning to his party", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ErBPIVG-lls/joe-donnelly-democrats-2020-progressive-medicare-for-all-sot-lead-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Outgoing Sen.

The opinions in this article belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Details of what happened October 2 were being drip-fed by Turkish officials with the narrative skill of TV scriptwriters hooking a global audience into an addictive box set.\n\nThe popular journalist and affable raconteur Jamal Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nHe'd been suffocated. His body had disappeared. He was allegedly chopped into pieces with a bone saw brought on a private plane.\n\nThere were various suggestions that his remains had been dissolved into acid, stuffed down a well or wrapped in a blanket and taken away by a local \"collaborator.\"\n\nAs the saga unfolded, the US Senate voted to accuse Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of being behind the killing.\n\nBut there's a subplot that might give this body bag of a story a silver lining.\n\nSaudi Arabia admitted, eventually, that The Washington Post columnist had indeed been killed, but that this was not sanctioned by the royal court. Rather, it was a unilateral decision taken on the ground by the head of a team that was supposed, at worst, to abduct Khashoggi and drag him back to the kingdom.\n\nWhatever the Saudis claim, the abiding result of the Khashoggi tragedy has been to paint Saudi Arabia as a vicious, uncivilized land run by a despotic family. Not as the forward-thinking nation and leading light of the modern Islamic world that its crown prince would like to project.\n\nOne Saudi critic of the royal court replied to a text I sent him from Riyadh in the first fortnight of covering the story in which I asked, \"Whodunnit?\"\n\n\"Don Corleone.\"\n\nBy referring to the fictitious mafia leader in \"The Godfather,\" the man was perhaps risking his life. Most other contacts in Riyadh to whom I spoke were circumspect to say the least -- sticking firmly to whatever the prevailing narrative was being spun out of the royal court.\n\nSo I deleted his text, removed his number from my contacts' list both in my phone and on the cloud -- and destroyed any notes that could have led an investigator to him.\n\nNot since the 1980 docudrama \"Death of a Princess,\" which alleged that Princess Mishaal bint Fahd al Saud was executed on the orders of her grandfather, and her alleged lover beheaded, has Saudi Arabia suffered such reputational damage.\n\nJUST WATCHED Time magazine names 2018 Person of the Year Replay More Videos ...

Indeed, it's a stalwart of the West's fight against violent political Islam, part of the US-led coalition standing against Iran's regional meddling, and the world's second-biggest producer of crude oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a vital economic partner, a major consumer of American weapons and an intimate friend when it comes to regional intelligence sharing.\n\nIt's also involved in a war in Yemen, which has killed an estimated 85,000 children , according to Save the Children. Another 14 million are at risk of starvation -- among them 400,000 children who are, the United Nations says, on the brink of hunger.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which supports the internationally recognized government of Yemen in its fight against the Iranian-backed Houthis, shows no signs of being able to win the war or stave off the humanitarian disaster.\n\nSo it's agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nSaudi Arabia cannot afford to be seen, or accused, of causing a famine on its doorstep.\n\nReeling from the fallout of the Khashoggi case, which it can do little about given the presumption of guilt that's attached itself to the kingdom's most powerful figure, Saudi Arabia needs to do and be seen to be doing \"the right thing.\"\n\nThat means backing away from war into peace in Yemen.\n\nIt's an unintended but welcome potential ending to the Khashoggi saga's subplot."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Inside the Japanese town that pays cash for kids", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/PlIpHlXoJPo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "The series on Japan's demographic reckoning is funded by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. None of the material in this series may be reproduced without an explicit credit to CNN and the Pulitzer Center.\n\nNagi, Japan (CNN) When Katsunori and Kaori Osaka had their first child, they were living in a cramped apartment in Nagoya, a city of more than 2 million people in central Japan.\n\nLike many other young couples, they tried to raise their child in the city but found life among the apartment blocks too crowded and expensive, with few child care options. Eventually, they gave up.\n\n\"When people are in their 20s and 30s, they can't really afford to live in a bigger space in a city,\" Katsunori said. \"We knew that if we wanted to have more kids, we couldn't do it there.\"\n\nCocooned amid hills, the little town of Nagi-cho is also home to a Japan Self Defense Forces garrison and the Nagi Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nFourteen years later, the Osakas moved to Nagi, where Katsunori grew up. The sleepy agricultural town in western Japan has become a success story in the country's efforts to boost its declining birth rate.\n\nWith a population of about 6,000, Nagi feels a world away from Nagoya, and residents cite the lack of busy streets and crowds as reasons why it is a great place to bring up children.\n\nBut they're not the only benefits: Nagi also pays couples who live there to have children.\n\nFamilies receive a one-time 100,000 yen ($879) payment for their first child, 150,000 yen ($1,335) for their second and as much as 400,000 yen ($3,518) for the fifth child born to the same family.\n\nNagi has been ramping up payments since 2004, as well as offering other fertility-boosting parental perks, to turbocharge the town's birth rate and buck Japan's broader trend of aging populations.\n\nPerks include subsidized housing, free vaccinations, school allowances and reduced nursery costs.\n\nAnd they appear to be working.\n\nIn the neighborhood where the Osakas live, most couples have three or more children because they can and they want to.\n\nThis leaves Nagi in stark contrast to much of Japan.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, the town's fertility rate -- based on the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime -- doubled from 1.4 to 2.8, to widespread domestic acclaim.\n\nSince then, Nagi's total fertility rate has dipped slightly to 2.39 but is still considerably higher than the national average of 1.46.\n\nThe Osakas say they'd like their children to experience the world first, instead of settling down immediately in Nagi-cho.\n\nShrinking Japan\n\nJapan has been on a steady demographic decline since the 1970s.\n\n1.3 million, In 2017, fewer than 950,000 babies were born while the number of deaths rose to a postwar high of1.3 million, according to the Ministry of Health and Labor.\n\nand children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. Japan's population is expected to drop to about The country's total population stands at 127 million,and children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. And by 2065 Japan's population is expected to drop to about 88 million\n\nMore than 5,400 children are seeking an elusive spot at day care centers in the city, nearly 30% of the national total.\n\nTraditionally, government policies had made it difficult for working men and women to balance their careers with family life, said Hirokazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nAs well as a lack of child care, the country's declining fertility rate is influenced by career demands and the increasing trend among men and women to delay or avoid marriage . The numbers of people still unmarried by age 50 hit a record 23.37% for men and 14.06% for women in 2015, according to a report released by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.\n\nBut Kato said another key factor is the steady migration of people from the countryside to expensive smaller apartments in crowded cities.\n\nMore than 93% of Japan's population lives in urban areas , where having one or more children is just too hard for many couples.\n\n\"There's a huge gap between the cost of living in Japan's major cities and the less populated areas of the country,\" Kato added. Couples in the city are often also far from their families, who could otherwise help support them.\n\nIt's not uncommon for families to have three to five children in Nagi. Kids play games with their siblings at the local preschool. For now, there is no waiting list to get a spot at day care.\n\nIs the progress enough?\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has introduced policies to boost its birth rate, such as enhancing child care services and improving housing and public facilities for families with children.\n\nLast year resulted in some progress nationally: The number of children on waiting lists for daycare centers nationwide slipped below 20,000 for the first time in 10 years, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\nspending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at daycare centers. Furthermore, that year, the government announced a 2 trillion yen ($18 billion)spending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at daycare centers.\n\nAs in many places around the world, women in Japan were traditionally expected to leave work to care for their families. But such attitudes are slowly shifting.\n\n\"The traditional way of thinking, 'men at work and women at home', is a historical relic in Japan,\" said Yukiko Inoue-Smith, a professor of education psychology at the University of Guam. \"Women in Japan want to keep their jobs, and their husbands want them to work so they can have a double income.\"\n\nGovernment efforts to keep women in the workforce through a plan called womenomics are also paying off.\n\nIn just three decades, the percentage of Japanese women age 30 to 34 who return to the labor force after becoming mothers has risen from 50% to 75%, according to recent reports.\n\nBut many of those who go back to work have to accept lower wages or get stuck on the career ladder, according to a report published in 2017 by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nFathers must also play a greater role in child care and the home so women can resume their careers, according to Inoue-Smith.\n\nThis presents its own difficulties. In Japan, new fathers can take up to one year of non-paid paternity leave -- one of the highest fathers leave periods in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, only 3% take this, as they fear the repercussions on their careers and income.\n\nA family-friendly future\n\nNestled amid leafy hills, Nagi is famous for its wagyu beef and boasts a small manufacturing center where 19 companies have factories. Life remains fairly traditional; most couples marry in their early to mid-20s and start families soon after.\n\nThe women who live in or move to the town know it doesn't offer high-flying careers but value the chance to balance work and home life.\n\nUp to 70% of women continue their day jobs, often as office workers or teachers, after childbirth. Lengthy commutes, grueling workloads and limited child care aren't a problem here. And for mothers who want to work a few hours a week, a local company offers casual jobs such as data inputting and packaging goods while their children are in daycare.\n\nNobue Sasaki stands in the hallway of the Nagi Child Home.\n\nThe town also spends a decent proportion of its budget on family services, partly due to extra funds it receives from the government for hosting a Japan Self-Defense Force garrison.\n\nIn the past, officials here have also accepted lower salaries so they can funnel more money into the town's future.\n\nSome large extended families still live under one roof, or at least within the same neighborhood, so grandparents can pitch in with the children while their parents work.\n\nNagi-cho strives to create a family-friendly setting for all age groups. Kozue Kobayashi relaxes with her child in the Nagi Child Home. An older volunteer watches over a busy mother's child.\n\n\"We've really focused on creating a family-friendly environment in Nagi,\" Nobue Sasaki, a soft-spoken town official, said inside the pastel-tinted walls of the Nagi Child Home, a center dedicated to supporting mothers and people across the age spectrum.\n\nKozue Kobayashi, a mother in her early 30s who moved from Okayama city to Nagi, said she appreciated the camaraderie of the Nagi Child Home, where she gets help looking after her children. She comes most days.\n\n\"It's better than just staying at home and feeling alone and overwhelmed,\" Kobayashi said. \"If I'd stayed in Okayama, I wouldn't have access to this kind of service.\"\n\nNagi undertook a large-scale public relations campaign in 2012 to publicize the success of its family planning initiatives -- and word has spread.\n\nWhen CNN visited, a group of smartly dressed senior bureaucrats milled around the entrance to the center's playroom. They were just some of the many people who had come to learn the town's fertility secrets.\n\n\"Our population has remained stable, but we can take some lessons away from a space like this,\" said Nagatoshi Ishiura, a bespectacled local politician from the neighboring town of Shouji. \"It's nice to see a place where there's still exchange between three different generations.\"\n\nThe Osakas' daughter prepares to play against her brother. The Osakas don't necessarily want their kids to stay in Nagi after they've grown up.\n\nAs well as parent-friendly policies, changing attitudes in Japanese society have helped create the right environment for having children in Nagi. Traditional expectations that women give up work after childbirth are breaking down. Choosing to be a stay-at-home mom is gradually becoming a personal choice rather than a societal obligation, said Inoue-Smith, the education psychology professor.\n\nKaori chose parenthood over her career but said she wouldn't necessarily want that for her own children.\n\n\"I'm not expecting my own daughters to stay in Nagi,\" she said. \"I'd prefer it if they left Nagi and saw more of the world.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A frugal social worker left $11 million to kids' charities", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/xdXDJsyVqbg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Alan Naiman was known for his frugality -- he wore Costco jeans, bought his favorite pocket T-shirts at a grocery store and squirreled away every penny he could.

He told the group in a letter that the center had been there for him when he needed to find a place for sick babies that were brought to him.\n\n\"We are so grateful to Alan, not only for his legacy, but also for the life he devoted to children,\" the group wrote.\n\nKaran said donations mostly to children's charities including Make-A-Wish, Father Flanagan's Boys Town and Treehouse, a non-profit that helps kids in foster care. He also gave money to his parents' Catholic church and Disabled American Veterans.\n\nNaiman was excited to think about how much good his money would do when the time came, Karan said.\n\n\"'My gift is going to be bigger than their annual budget.

In an administration steeped in scandal, the stench of corruption thickens by the day.\n\nThe President is calling the shots and trusting his gut.\n\nHe's replaced calming forces -- such as ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and chief of staff John Kelly -- with more pliable loyalists less likely to challenge him, Mike Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney, respectively.\n\nThe result is a presidency increasingly testing limits on executive power and liberated by the commander in chief's prerogative to decree foreign policy.\n\nAfter nine months back in the real world Tillerson offered a chilling glimpse into how Trump operates.\n\n\"I'd have to say to him, 'Well, Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way.

In fact, he may not control his own fate.\n\nThe relentless march of special counsel Robert Mueller is bolstering the possibility that Trump won the presidency by colluding with a hostile foreign power and tried to enrich himself in the process.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and Mueller has yet to prove that the campaign colluded with Russia or the President obstructed justice to cover it up.\n\nThere is, however, a darkening cloud over the President .

They were also validation for his voters, who see his populist crusade as the scourge of international elites.\n\nBut for anyone who believes that the values and international infrastructure that Trump is undermining underpinned decades of relative peace, won the Cold War and made the world safe for capitalism, these are worrying times.\n\nTrump also escalated his war on fact and truth in 2018, inventing new narratives when reality doesn't suit him, compromising trust in critical political and legal institutions.\n\nIn recent days, for instance, the President has falsely claimed that the US eradicated ISIS in Syria. Greeting troops in Iraq, he lied when he said he had given them their first pay raise for 10 years and that it was 10%.\n\nThere is a method to Trump's assault on institutions and facts.

But whether he'll actually be sworn in as a member of Congress next week remains up in the air, as he would need a court to quickly rule that he is entitled to the seat -- because the state board did not certify the result, there is no legal authority outside of a court order to allow him to take his seat.\n\nAnd House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is set to take on the position of majority leader in the next Congress, said Democrats will work to ensure Harris is not seated.\n\n\"Given the now well-documented election fraud that took place in NC-09, Democrats would object to any attempt by Mr. Harris to be seated on January 3,\" Hoyer said in a statement. \"In this instance, the integrity of our democratic process outweighs concerns about the seat being vacant at the start of the new Congress.\"\n\nHoyer later told CNN's Jim Acosta on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\" \"My own view is, we probably ought to redo the general election.\"\n\nThe decision to disband the board represents a jarring reversal by state Republicans who earlier this month had all but endorsed the need for new elections amid mounting evidence of election fraud on behalf of the Harris campaign and a report that early voter data had been leaked in Bladen County.\n\nThe filing came a day after a three-judge state court panel denied a stay to keep the state elections board, which is investigating the allegations, in its current form and ordered the board to dissolve at noon Friday.\n\nThe board had refused to certify Harris as November's winner amid evidence of irregularities in the absentee ballot count and reports of a fraud scheme directed by a Republican operative hired by Harris' campaign.\n\nHarris leads in the unofficial tally of the 2018 election by 905 votes over Democratic candidate Dan McCready.\n\nIn a statement, McCready ripped Harris and his campaign.\n\n\"Over the past month, it has become abundantly clear that North Carolinians had their voices silenced during the election in North Carolina's Ninth District,\" McCready said in a statement. \"Mark Harris and his allies promised to support a complete investigation into this attack on our democracy. He has now broken this promise and is instead doing all he can to obstruct this bipartisan investigation into the illegal election activities within his own campaign.\n\n\"All North Carolinians -- regardless of party -- deserve a swift and complete investigation without panicked obstruction from Mark Harris. Now more than ever we deserve to know what Mark Harris knew and when he knew it.\"\n\nIn its petition, the Harris campaign wrote to the board that it, \"is not aware of irregularities or other concerns sufficient in number to change the outcome of the election in the 9th district.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, before filing the petition, Harris told WBT radio in Charlotte he is willing to take the fight to court if the board doesn't certify the results of the election.\n\nThough the board has dissolved, board staffers can continue to work on the investigation, but they will not be able to issue subpoenas, hold hearings or call for a new election, said Josh Lawson, the board's general counsel.\n\n\"As you know, your client (Harris) is under a subpoena dated December 1, but has made only one production on December 7 totaling 398 pages,\" the board's former chair Joshua Malcolm wrote in its response to the Harris campaign's petition. \"Yet your client through counsel indicated that you possess roughly 140,000 additional documents that may be responsive but have not yet been produced. We have received repeated assurances\u2014as recently as December 24\u2014regarding your efforts to comply with the subpoena.\n\nHe added, \"You are hereby requested to fully comply with the Board's subpoena so as to not further impact the agency's ability to resolve the investigation.\"\n\nMalcolm also said board staffers have attempted to schedule an interview with Harris, whose team has indicated he is willing to sit down for an interview.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Party's executive director Dallas Woodhouse said Harris has been cooperating with the board's investigation.\n\n\"He's not required to send to a Democrat every piece of paper a campaign ever put forward,\" Woodhouse said Friday on CNN's \"Newsroom.\" \"By the way, it is irrelevant. The board of elections needed to establish that these things happened, that they happened at all. Mr. Harris only ever touched his ballot. His. He doesn't have anything to add. This was an absolutely atrocious smear by a disgraced democrat elections chair, the former chair now on the way out. It is unconscionable.\"\n\nWoodhouse told CNN that the three-judge panel recognized that the board of elections, led by Malcolm, \"was going to just continue a never-ending fishing expedition.\"\n\nHe predicted that the federal court would order the state of North Carolina to certify the November results.\n\nThe board had planned to hold an evidentiary hearing in the case on January 11, 2019.\n\nThe board's current structure had been struck down before the 2018 election, but the court had delayed implementing that order until now.\n\nIn their ruling Thursday, the judges said the board had not complied with previous court orders and that they had not provided enough information about why the hearing had been delayed.\n\nA new board to be appointed\n\nThere is also uncertainty over the makeup of the elections board. A new state law requires Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to appoint a new board, but not until January 31, 2019.\n\nIn a letter Friday to both state party chairs, Cooper said he will appoint a temporary five-member board under the old rules to preside until the end of January \"to hasten the investigatory work by the Board and maintain continuity.\"\n\nState Republicans have said Cooper does not have the authority to do so and plan to challenge that in court as well. The party has also said they will not accept appointments to the temporary board Cooper is trying to establish.\n\nThe state elections board had been expected to call for a new election in early 2019 if it was able to corroborate the evidence of irregularities in the 9th district race.\n\nState Democratic Party officials have called for a new election in the district, and Republicans largely conceded a few weeks ago that a second vote will likely be necessary. The state legislature overrode the governor's veto of a bill that requires any call for a new election to also provide for another primary, which would give Republicans a chance to replace Harris before a rematch with McCready.\n\nA Democratic strategist familiar with the situation accused the Republican Party of doing a complete turnaround in its position from letting the board continue its investigation to attempting to certify the election results Friday.\n\n\"The new position coming from the Woodhouse camp is surprising,\" the strategist said. \"They have a lot of explaining to do. They have produced no evidence to the state board of elections, their candidate has refused to comply with the subpoenas, given no evidence, and are they are trying to strong-arm the state board of elections into taking no further action.\"\n\nWayne Goodwin, the chair of the state Democratic Party, went further.\n\n\"Mark Harris is trying to steal this election. It is obstruction of an investigation,\" Goodwin said Friday in an interview on CNN's \"Newsroom.\"\n\nHe added later, \"Governor Cooper is trying to do his best within the law so we can have a board established and it will be established under the last constitutional law to get the job done. There is ample evidence provided publicly and I'm confident there is more evidence that the Republicans apparently don't want us to see. This is obstruction of an investigation.\"\n\nThe investigation\n\nOfficials are in the process of reviewing evidence of absentee ballot fraud allegedly orchestrated by Leslie McRae Dowless, whose efforts potentially helped Harris win Bladen County.\n\n\"To date, the State Board's investigative staff has conducted more than 100 interviews, and the staff is actively engaged in the review of more than 182,000 pages of materials produced in response to 12 subpoenas issued by the State Board,\" Joshua Malcolm, the Democratic chair of the board, said in an affidavit filed in court on December 21.\n\nHarris has denied any wrongdoing. In his interview with WBT radio, Harris defended his decision to hire Dowless, saying that the GOP operative was recommended to him by political leaders he trusted in the state.\n\nHarris claimed specifically that Dowless said he does not collect, or \"harvest,\" absentee ballots, which Dowless is accused of doing and is an illegal practice in North Carolina.\n\nHe also floated a conspiracy theory that the elections board, which is made up of both Republican and Democratic members, purposely held on to that information to prevent him from winning the election.\n\n\"Did they decide that they would sit on this and they would wait, and they would see and somehow if $11 million and Dan McCready couldn't beat Mark Harris, this would be an insurance policy that they would play to get a do-over?\" Harris asked. \"I would hate to think that we had an agency in our state government that would operate with that kind of sinister leadership, but I am telling you the facts are the facts, they sat on this and we could've known what was happening there, and I just think it is sad.\"\n\nThe state's Republican Party applauded the Harris' campaign's decision to file a petition in court.\n\n\"It is important to note that no serious evidence of some of the most concerning allegations including widespread destruction of ballots ever materialized,\" North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement Friday. \"There is simply no concrete evidence to show that even the mishandling of some absentee ballots amounted to a change of more than a thousand votes in this race.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Government files sealed response to Supreme Court in mystery grand jury case", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/RR2hI0GaHp4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The federal government responded Friday to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' issuance of a temporary pause on an order holding an unnamed, foreign government-owned company in contempt over a mystery court case related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nThe government response was filed under seal ahead of Monday's deadline.\n\nThis is the first known legal challenge apparently related to Mueller's investigation to make its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe company asked the Supreme Court to intervene after a federal appeals court ruling that ordered the company to comply with the subpoena, which required it to turn over \"information\" about its commercial activity in a criminal investigation.

As part of its rule for managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the EPA has banned the \"sewering\" (or pouring down the drain or toilet) of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at health care facilities.\n\nHowever, this rule, which was only finalized this month, applies only to drugs considered hazardous waste , such as toxic chemotherapy drugs. Most pharmaceuticals do not fall into this category.\n\nIn contrast to the EPA's stance, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised individuals to sewer narcotics and controlled substances , including morphine and other opioids, in order to avoid harm to animals and humans , including children, who could gain access to these powerful and dangerous drugs.\n\n\"To date, scientists have found no evidence of harmful effects to human health from medicines in the environment,\" the FDA website says.\n\nThe FDA does not provide official guidance to hospitals. Still, the recommendation of this federal agency might carry weight with hospital administrators, who must also consider and follow the requirements of the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nRusty Payne, a spokesman for the DEA, explained that diversion is his agency's primary concern when it comes to how hospitals handle pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\"Many problems associated with drug abuse are the result of legitimately made controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into illicit drug traffic,\" the DEA website says. In plain English, doctors, nurses or other hospital staff sometimes steal pharmaceuticals labeled controlled substances by the DEA -- opioids, mostly -- in order to sell them for profit or use themselves.\n\n\"We document the sales, what comes in and out, in terms of controlled substances, not all drugs, just controlled substances,\" Payne said. For example, the DEA demands that painkillers such as morphine and other opioids be \"heavily documented in terms of how they're distributed and administered in a hospital.\"\n\nFor this reason, hospitals and hospital pharmacies have strict regulations that require nurses to document each use of a controlled substance, according to Payne. He's been told that \"it's fairly common\" for hospitals to waste liquid medicines down the sink.\n\nGeneral regulations\n\n\"There aren't too many contaminants that would build up in drinking water,\" said George Cushnie, technical director for the EPA-sponsored Healthcare Resource Center, which provides pollution prevention and environmental information to health care organizations.\n\nBecause most drinking water comes from rivers or reservoirs, \"you're constantly using water, and there's new water coming in, so there's really not an opportunity for it to build up.\"\n\nMike Focazio, program coordinator of the Geological Survey's Toxic Substances Hydrology Program, said his agency has not done testing of waste specifically coming out of hospitals, but it has done \"wastewater studies that come out of what we call sewer sheds -- in other words, a city or a town that does include hospitals.\"\n\n\"We have sampled that water for many years,\" he said. \"We have found that we can detect a variety of pharmaceutical residues at very low levels in quite a lot of different waste streams across the country.\"\n\n'Complicated' mixture of drugs\n\nPharmaceutical water contamination is common knowledge. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report on environmental health reads, \"pharmaceuticals may enter the environment and ultimately drinking water supplies in various ways, such as through the elimination of human and animal waste, disposal of unused medicines down the toilet or drain, veterinary drug usage, hospital waste disposal, and industrial discharges.\"\n\nWhat is unknown, Focazio said, is how much of that is due to hospitals versus people in their homes discarding unused medicines or simply metabolizing medicines, which we excrete in urine and feces that flows into our toilets.\n\nCushnie said his \"gut feeling is, most likely, households are discharging a lot more of their unused meds into the sewer system than hospitals.\" He believes that a larger number of people are using and disposing medications at home compared with the number of patients lying in hospital beds.\n\nWhether pharmaceutical residues in water samples come from hospital or home use, Focazio said, the concentration levels are much higher in some places than in others.\n\n\"If you look at the concentrations that we detect -- even at those high concentrations -- and you compare it to the dose that somebody would take -- even in, again, those places with very high levels or higher than elsewhere -- you'd have to drink enormous amounts of water just to get back to that prescribed dose,\" Focazio said.\n\n\"But the question is: What does it mean from a health standpoint when these low levels get out into the environment?\" he said. The human health effects are unknown. And it's not just one drug, say, one particular antidepressant. It's many brands and types of antidepressants plus an assortment of antihistamines and anti-inflammatories and all sorts of other pharmaceuticals mixed together.\n\n\"It gets very complicated very fast,\" Focazio said.\n\nMedicine or poison?\n\nIncreasingly, environmental scientists are wondering whether the very substances that are meant to cure us -- medicines -- might also pose a threat to our health when found in drinking water. As a result, pharmaceuticals have been listed as \" contaminants of emerging concern \" by the EPA.\n\nIn some cases, contaminants of emerging concern have probably been discharged into the environment for a long time before new and more sensitive detection methods could identify them, notes a GAO report . Harms to aquatic life have been documented by a number of studies , yet possible negative effects for human health are inconclusive. The EPA has begun the process of revising its existing guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.\n\nOther public health agencies, including the UN's World Health Organization, express similar concerns and findings as the EPA. \"There is a substantial margin of safety between the very low concentrations of pharmaceuticals that would be consumed in drinking-water and the minimum therapeutic doses, which suggests a very low risk to human health,\" a recent WHO report finds.\n\n'A whole soup of drugs'\n\nDr. David J.C. Constable, science director of the American Chemical Society's Green Chemistry Institute, explained the rationale behind the WHO report, though he was not involved in it or in decisions made at the EPA.\n\n\"When you take a drug, it is given at a dose which causes a desired therapeutic effect. However, it will cause some physiological response at a lower dose,\" Constable wrote in an email. \"This difference in response vs effect gives a significant margin of safety for most drugs.\" This is why WHO says concentrations well below therapeutic effect are very low risk to human health, he said.\n\nMae Wu, a senior attorney in the health program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said one of its big questions and concerns is that the EPA and other groups, when examining the safety of pharmaceuticals in drinking water, may be basing their assessment on the \"therapeutic\" levels approved by the FDA.\n\n\"But the reality is, once it gets into our drinking water, we are not talking about any one drug, right? We're talking about a whole soup of drugs, and for every location, it's a different mixture,\" she said.\n\nThough toxicologists test chemicals in combinations, they do not test each and every unique combination of mixed drugs and other chemicals found in the sewers of individual cities in the United States.\n\nWu also said that most FDA-approved drugs have been tested only in adults. Young babies and children do not participate in clinical trials that test adult medications for safety and effectiveness, she said, yet babies and children \"are often more vulnerable and more sensitive to these types of things.\"\n\n\"We definitely don't know what's happening there,\" she said.\n\nConstable believes that \"the question of mixtures is what has people in the EPA most concerned.\" The assumption is that the cocktail of chemicals in drinking water, food and air \"can't be good for you,\" he wrote. \"There is a fear of synergistic effects; that is, 1+1 > 2, or that the presence of one compound decreases the body's ability to metabolize another.\"\n\n'Multigenerational impacts'?\n\nThere are additional concerns that low-concentration exposures to chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, are leading to \"multigenerational impacts\" that we have not been able to discern, he said.\n\n\"The problem for everyone is that we just don't really have a good handle on this. No one does, and the debate is that the precautionary principle should be applied,\" Constable wrote in an email. That principle amounts to \"if we don't know, there is no acceptable level,\" he said, and once that point is reached, science begins to devolve into \"a discussion of policy.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince the late '90s, when scientists learned of a variety of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, in the nation's waterways, \"there was a lot of activity by the government and the Pharma industry to systematically assess the extent of pharmaceuticals in the environment,\" Constable wrote. A great deal of work has been going into this \"over many years,\" he said.\n\nFocazio said the US Geological Survey has started looking more recently not just at what can be detected but at \"what does it mean from a health standpoint.\"\n\n\"The human health aspect of this is a little bit out of our wheelhouse, so we are working with other public health agencies to give them the data so at least they know what the levels are,\" he said. The Geological Survey has begun studies on fish and aquatic biota to see how these other life forms are affected.\n\nAwaiting more extensive research into human health effects, simple solutions at the hospital level may be available.\n\n\"There is a company that has a safe box that comes with a neutralizing solution in it that can be used for wasting narcotics, but I have yet to see anyone use it,\" Deesy said, adding that she's asked several hospitals \"to investigate using them with no response.\"\n\nAwareness among hospital staff is also key, she said, and though she tried repeatedly to raise the awareness of health care administrators through local media, she once again hit a brick wall of \"no response.\"\n\n\"We don't need to be destroying our water,\" Deesy said. \"We should be taking care of our water.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "The impact homelessness and the opioid crisis are having on San Francisco streets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/spGi0Rn2zHM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "San Francisco (CNN) Outside the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in downtown San Francisco, a woman urinates on the sidewalk and smokes a crack pipe.\n\nInside her purse are about a dozen used heroin needles. She shoots heroin up to 10 times per day, she says.\n\nAbout 50 yards away, a man injects another woman in the neck with a needle. She puts her thumb in her mouth and blows on it to make her vein more visible. Her right arm is caked with dried blood.\n\nCNN obscured parts of this photo to protect the identity of the subjects.\n\nThis San Francisco neighborhood is home to the headquarters of Uber, Twitter and Salesforce. But stroll around here, and you're also likely to find used drug paraphernalia, trash, and human excrement on the sidewalks, and people lying in various states of consciousness.\n\nPublic drug usage and homelessness are not new problems for the city of San Francisco. But residents say the situation has gotten worse in recent years. As of October, 7,500 complaints about discarded needles have been made this year, compared with 6,363 last year. In 2015, the number was less than 3,000.\n\nIt's moved some locals -- so-called \"video vigilantes\" -- to document the mess they see, in an attempt to get the city's attention.\n\nAdam Mesnick, a restaurateur who lives and works in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, started posting daily photos and videos of people using drugs in public, urinating near his restaurant, or lying passed out on the sidewalk.\n\n\"More mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco,\" Mesnick wrote in one post, accompanied by photos of angry sores on people's backs, hands and legs.\n\nmore mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco, homeless addicts.

In another, human feces lies nestled in front of a doorway. In a video apparently taken from inside Mesnick's restaurant, a man can be seen urinating in a doorway across the street.\n\nMesnick isn't trying to shame homeless people with his Twitter posts, he says, but \"to actually find help for these people.\" He's been giving leftover food from his restaurant to the homeless for the past ten years, he said.\n\nOver the past five or six years, Mesnick says, visible homelessness and drug use on the streets have seemed to spread from areas of San Francisco where they were once concentrated, like the Tenderloin.\n\nThis has been like this since Friday. Yes today is Monday. pic.twitter.com/d91e9MU2VY \u2014 bettersoma (@bettersoma) October 29, 2018\n\n\"It's like third world squalor,\" Mesnick said. \"I'm a small business (owner) trying to exist, and basically surrounded by decay that continues to get worse and worse and worse.\"\n\nOthers fear that the situation will impact tourism. \"If we can't find a solution to this problem,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, CEO of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, \"it will tarnish the city's brand.\"\n\nAnother longtime resident tweets about the state of the neighborhood using the handle @cleanupwestsoma. He asked to remain anonymous because his friends don't know he runs the account, and says he's lived in San Francisco for 21 years, 12 of them in SoMa.\n\n\"I post as I go to work. I'll sometimes come home from lunch and see a giant drug deal going on,\" he said. \"I'll leave and go back to work and see someone going to the bathroom in the street. It blows me away that this continues to happen in the city.\"\n\nMesnick and @cleanupwestsoma want to send a message to city officials about what's happening in their neighborhoods. They often tweet at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who took office in a special election in July after the death of Mayor Ed Lee.\n\n\"You know what? I already had the message, as a native San Franciscan, as someone who's been here all my life,\" Breed told CNN. \"It isn't acceptable.\"\n\nBreed, 44, made tackling homelessness and drug addiction a signature of her campaign platform. She says the city has been making changes since she took office, and that they're slowly starting to have an impact. \"It's not an unsolvable problem,\" she said.\n\nLast week, the mayor announced a detailed plan to direct a $181 million cash windfall the city received from the state to homelessness, affordable housing and related problems. The proposal includes nearly $20 million to be spent on beds for patients who have addiction and mental health problems. An additional $4 million would go toward expanding street cleaning.\n\nAnd Breed says visible progress has already been made.\n\n\"If you walk with me right now, you will see the difference,\" she said. \"You'll see more police officers. You'll see the homeless outreach team. You'll see people power-washing on a regular basis and picking up trash.\" Tent encampments are down by 27% since she took office, she said.\n\nKevin Schwing, who works in SoMa, said that despite the city's efforts, he doesn't see a change in the numbers of people on the streets.\n\n\"I don't really know what the city can do,\" he said. \"The city cleans up sidewalks every day. But I don't see any difference in terms of the amount of people.\"\n\n\"I see human waste. Injections. Probably 10 times per day,\" he said. \"Sometimes people look like they're dead.\"\n\nBreed says the city is cracking down on drug dealing, and aims to open at least 1,000 new shelter beds by the end of 2020.\n\nAnd she's looking at new ways to approach these entrenched problems, she says. Breed supports safe injection sites -- facilities where people can inject heroin in a private setting and under the supervision of health care workers. The sites would \"not only be a way to get people off the streets and get the needles off the streets, but to get people into treatment,\" Breed said. California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have allowed safe injection sites in the state.\n\nShe also supports conservatorship programs for the severely mentally ill, which would allow the state to \"make decisions for them in order to place them into mental health stabilization beds, instead of our criminal justice system.\" Gov. Brown recently signed a bill that would allow such action to take place.\n\nBreed says she hopes the \"video vigilantes\" tag 311, the city's non-emergency complaint service center, in their posts. The information they're putting out helps the city address challenges in specific neighborhoods, she said.\n\nThe city's Department of Public Health recently partnered with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, essentially hiring contract workers to fan the streets and collect used needles.\n\nCrisis intervention teams have also stepped up their efforts to provide addicts with the drug buprenorphine, a narcotic to help reduce a person's addiction to heroin and other opioids.\n\n\"We go to people that are using drugs and offer them treatment instead of the traditional model which has people coming into a clinic,\" said Dr. Naveena Bobba, the department's deputy director of health.\n\nThe city has also launched the so-called \"poop patrol,\" a team that responds to complaints of feces on city streets.\n\nSoMa resident Alesia Panajota said she sees an impact. \"They're doing the best they can,\" she said. \"I think things are getting better under London Breed.\"\n\nSan Francisco may also see an influx of cash to help solve the crisis, after a controversial ballot measure passed in November. Known as \"Prop C,\" the measure is viewed as a \"homeless tax\" -- it aims to raise $300 million a year to spend on homeless services by taxing big businesses.\n\nSalesforce Chairman and Co-CEO Marc Benioff spent at least $7 million of his own money to help ensure Prop C's passage. \"We have to say enough is enough,\" he recently told CNN.\n\nBut legal challenges could prevent the city from receiving the funds for several years.\n\nIn the meantime, Mesnick keeps posting. He recently put up a video interview with a homeless man talking about how difficult it is to find a place to go to the bathroom after dark.\n\n\"Help this guy,\" Mesnick wrote. \"Keep the restrooms open at night? Perhaps we change usage of our space and make it a bathroom share? Better than on our front stoop...\"\n\n\"We are in a severe epidemic here,\" he told CNN. \"My angle may seem to be a little rough around the edges, but it's really about compassion.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "One city's answer to preventing teen e-cigarette use: Sell in adult-only stores", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/a0oHJ8rqllg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Attempting to beat back the rise of vaping among teens, the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, voted this month to limit e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes to the shelves of tobacco stores open only to customers 21 and older.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Massachusetts raising the legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21, which goes into effect on December 31.\n\nSomerville's move, the first of its kind in the state and possibly the nation, goes further by taking menthol and e-cigarettes out of shops, like convenience stores, that teens can enter.

When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?\"\n\nThere are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.\n\n\"Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,\" she adds.\n\nAdopt a dog\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are particular health benefits in adopting a dog, says Dr Rhys Thatcher\n\nA gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.\n\nBut though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University.\n\nInstead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping.\n\nBut there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says.\n\nIf you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption.\n\n\"This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,\" says Dr Thatcher.\n\nGet your 30 a week\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say diversity of plant-based foods is also important\n\nWe have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nBut according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity.\n\nWe should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.\n\nThat is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health.\n\nThe bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.\n\nAllergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOne way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi.\n\n\"Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix.

At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it.\n\n\"Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year.\"\n\nAnd finally, get enough sleep\n\nIt may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults).\n\nEven being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter.\n\nThere are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.\n\nBut Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "How to resist 'drink pushers' during the festive season", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46632332", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Midnight Oil Image caption Actor Stephen McGann gets indignant with those who try to make him drink alcohol\n\nWhen actor Stephen McGann recently tweeted about his frustration with people who pressurised others to drink alcohol, he received an outpouring of support on social media.\n\n\"Many people talked to me about the agonies they go through during Christmas.

Now I get bloody-minded and indignant if people try to push a drink on me. Booze is so deeply ingrained in our culture.

Sometimes it's just easier not to go out, as I get too tempted.\n\n\"Even if others don't pressurise me, you feel a silent pressure. It's a bit like being a vegan, it gets other people's backs up because they feel guilty or judged.\"\n\nHaig notes British society's obsession with drinking. \"As soon as we get that off switch we drink. Go to Gatwick and you'll see people drinking at 08:00. It's changing, young people are drinking less, but I'll never be that Mediterranean person who can have one glass of wine.\"\n\nHis tips for being a non-drinker include ordering a virgin Bloody Mary, \"it feels hedonistic\", going to a restaurant rather than a bar or pub, doing exercise to replace that space where you \"let off steam\", and saying to those who try to foist drinks on you: \"I don't drink.\"\n\n\"People think there must be a reason and don't question it. It's about not feeling guilty, and not doing things out of obligation. The trouble with being a man is that we literally can't think of anywhere to meet that isn't a pub.\"\n\n'I tell them I'm a loose cannon if I drink'\n\nImage copyright Catherine Gray Image caption Catherine Gray used to be a \"drink pusher\" until she gave up alcohol\n\nCatherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober Journal, recalls how when she used to drink she was one of the \"meanest drink pushers\".\n\n\"If somebody wasn't drinking I didn't want them there. But it was to do with my issues rather than them. It's the heaviest drinkers who call you no fun. They want an accomplice.\"\n\nGray, 38, gave up alcohol five years ago. \"I couldn't moderate. But then I hardly know anyone who can moderate, it's hard.\"\n\nNow when people try to encourage her to drink she makes a joke of it. \"Nobody wants to hear you go on about the health risks. I tell them I'm a loose cannon. I make a joke out of it. Never be apologetic, people will leap on that.\"\n\n'Social loneliness'\n\nYet despite the fact that alcohol is deeply embedded in our social lives, the culture is changing. Recent figures from a study by the University of London showed that almost a third of young people don't drink at all.\n\nEven so, young people, particularly those with mental health issues, still struggle with alcohol.\n\nJennifer Griffin, psychotherapist and general manager of Turn2me - an online charitable mental health website for young people, says many of those they help find social occasions that revolve around drinking difficult.\n\n\"Alcohol is linked to anxiety and depression. Yet socialising is how young people develop a connection to their peers. If they choose not to socialise because they will be exposed to alcohol, then they might alienate themselves and suffer from loneliness.\n\n\"The [buying a] round system is also an issue, it's lovely and generous, but it's difficult to resist.\"\n\nGriffin suggests working out a strategy in advance, and prioritising your own needs.\n\nAs awareness of the health risks grow, not drinking, or cutting back on drinking, is becoming increasingly common. Everyone is in agreement. If someone says no to a drink, don't ask twice.\n\nFollow Laurel Ives on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: Indonesian volcano's dramatic collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46707731", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently\n\nThe scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear.\n\nResearchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea.\n\nThey say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week.\n\nMuch of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement.\n\nIt would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra.\n\nIndonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Your Next Pair of Shoes Could Be Made From a Fruit", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/your-next-pair-of-shoes-could-be-made-from-a-fruit/4720486.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nPineapples aren't just a delicious fruit, they could be part of your next pair of shoes or piece of clothing.

It would preserve about 425 stores that Sears has yet to close and secure the jobs of up to 50,000 workers out of the 68,000 employed by the retailer. An affiliate of ESL, Transform Holdco LLC, submitted the bid, the spokesman said.\n\n\u200bPeople familiar with the matter said the financing comes from Sears\u2019 existing lenders Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc, as well Royal Bank of Canada, which was not previously a lender, which together agreed to provide a $950 million asset-based loan and a $350 million revolving credit line.\n\nSome of Lampert\u2019s bid relies on $1.8 billion of Sears debt that ESL already holds and plans to forgive to back the offer, the sources said. The bid also includes about $400 million in financing from non-bank lenders, the sources said.\n\nThe bid contemplates assuming protection agreements Sears has previously sold to reassure customers who have bought appliances, televisions, lawn tractors and other big-ticket items, the ESL spokesman said.\n\n\u201cFactoring for all considerations, we believe that our going concern bid provides the best path forward for the company, the best option to save tens of thousands of jobs and is superior for all of Sears\u2019 stakeholders to the alternative of a complete liquidation,\u201d the ESL spokesman said. \u201cMuch work remains and there is no assurance our proposal will be completed.\u201d\n\nNext move is Sears'\n\nSears will now evaluate the bid to determine whether it is viable, and there remains a possibility the company could reject it, some of the sources said.\n\nA Sears spokeswoman declined to comment.

Only Lampert\u2019s ESL offered to buy the entire company.\n\nThe only other bids Sears has received are from suitors interested in pieces of the company and liquidators prepared to run going-out-of-business sales at stores and shut down the retailer.\n\nSears dates back to the late 1880s. Its mail-order catalogs with merchandise ranging from toys, medicine and gramophones to automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon.com Inc. of its time.\n\nBut the iconic retailer gradually lost its shine as consumers increasingly favored brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart Inc and Target Corp and e-commerce.\n\nLampert, who through ESL is Sears\u2019 biggest shareholder and creditor, formed Sears Holdings in 2005 by acquiring Sears Roebuck in an $11 billion deal and combining it with discount chain Kmart, which he had also taken over.\n\nLampert had pledged to restore Sears to its glory days, when it owned the Sears Tower in Chicago, then the world\u2019s tallest building, and companies that included a radio station and Allstate insurance.

Chief Justice John Roberts seems determined to lead the one Washington institution that stays above the political fray. Even Roberts' rebuke of President Donald Trump, after the president criticized a federal judge, was in defense of an independent, apolitical judiciary.\n\nThe next few weeks will test whether the calm can last.\n\nWhen they gather in private Jan. 4 to consider new cases for arguments in April and into next term, the justices will confront a raft of high-profile appeals.\n\nAbortion restrictions, workplace discrimination against LGBT people and partisan gerrymandering are on the agenda. Close behind are appeals from the Trump administration seeking to have the court allow it to end an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation and to put in place restrictive rules for transgender troops.\n\nConservatives ready\n\nThere already are signs that the conservative justices, apart from Roberts, are willing to take on controversial cases that are likely to produce the ideological and partisan divisions that their colleagues seem eager to avoid.\n\nIn recent weeks, three conservative justices accused the court of ducking its job of deciding important cases, especially when lower courts have disagreed on the outcome. Their criticism, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, came after a recent decision to avoid a case involving funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nThen, on the Friday before Christmas, the court divided 5-4 in refusing to allow the Trump administration to enforce new restrictions on asylum seekers. Roberts joined the four liberals. The three conservatives who were displeased by the Planned Parenthood case outcome again noted their disagreement, this time joined by Kavanaugh.\n\nThe two votes can't be used to draw any firm conclusions about what may be happening behind closed doors at the court, as the cases arrived in different circumstances. In the Planned Parenthood case, the justices were considering whether to grant full review, a process that takes only four votes. The asylum case was an emergency appeal from the administration. At least five of the nine justices would have had to vote in the administration's favor.\n\nReasons for caution\n\nBut Lawrence Solum, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University's law school, said Roberts seems to have two reasons to limit the court's involvement in hot-button cases: his preference for taking small steps in the law and his concern for the court's reputation.\n\n\"It's clear that 5-4 decisions will be perceived by many, many lawyers, many politicians and large numbers of the public at large as ideological decisions,'' Solum said. \"So given Roberts' desire to preserve the legitimacy of the court, he could be highly motivated to avoid decisions like that in the next immediate period in the history of the court. Whether that's one year, or two years or five years, who knows?''\n\nThe court arrived at this point after an unusual chain of events that began with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Senate Republicans refused to act on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, allowing Trump to put Gorsuch on the court in 2017. To this day, Democrats say the seat was stolen from them.\n\nThen, over the summer, Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement meant that Trump would also get to replace the court's swing vote with a more reliable conservative.

Chief Justice John Roberts seems determined to lead the one Washington institution that stays above the political fray. Even Roberts' rebuke of President Donald Trump, after the president criticized a federal judge, was in defense of an independent, apolitical judiciary.\n\nThe next few weeks will test whether the calm can last.\n\nWhen they gather in private Jan. 4 to consider new cases for arguments in April and into next term, the justices will confront a raft of high-profile appeals.\n\nAbortion restrictions, workplace discrimination against LGBT people and partisan gerrymandering are on the agenda. Close behind are appeals from the Trump administration seeking to have the court allow it to end an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation and to put in place restrictive rules for transgender troops.\n\nConservatives ready\n\nThere already are signs that the conservative justices, apart from Roberts, are willing to take on controversial cases that are likely to produce the ideological and partisan divisions that their colleagues seem eager to avoid.\n\nIn recent weeks, three conservative justices accused the court of ducking its job of deciding important cases, especially when lower courts have disagreed on the outcome. Their criticism, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, came after a recent decision to avoid a case involving funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nThen, on the Friday before Christmas, the court divided 5-4 in refusing to allow the Trump administration to enforce new restrictions on asylum seekers. Roberts joined the four liberals. The three conservatives who were displeased by the Planned Parenthood case outcome again noted their disagreement, this time joined by Kavanaugh.\n\nThe two votes can't be used to draw any firm conclusions about what may be happening behind closed doors at the court, as the cases arrived in different circumstances. In the Planned Parenthood case, the justices were considering whether to grant full review, a process that takes only four votes. The asylum case was an emergency appeal from the administration. At least five of the nine justices would have had to vote in the administration's favor.\n\nReasons for caution\n\nBut Lawrence Solum, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University's law school, said Roberts seems to have two reasons to limit the court's involvement in hot-button cases: his preference for taking small steps in the law and his concern for the court's reputation.\n\n\"It's clear that 5-4 decisions will be perceived by many, many lawyers, many politicians and large numbers of the public at large as ideological decisions,'' Solum said. \"So given Roberts' desire to preserve the legitimacy of the court, he could be highly motivated to avoid decisions like that in the next immediate period in the history of the court. Whether that's one year, or two years or five years, who knows?''\n\nThe court arrived at this point after an unusual chain of events that began with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Senate Republicans refused to act on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, allowing Trump to put Gorsuch on the court in 2017. To this day, Democrats say the seat was stolen from them.\n\nThen, over the summer, Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement meant that Trump would also get to replace the court's swing vote with a more reliable conservative. Kavanaugh's track record as an appellate judge suggested he was that man, but his confirmation was nearly derailed by allegations of sexual assault, which Kavanaugh denied.\n\nThe accusations against Kavanaugh turned the confirmation process into a national spectacle that culminated in a hearing with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of assaulting her when they were in high school.

Male immigrants were 28 percent less likely to die prematurely from all causes than native-born men, while female immigrants were 25 percent less likely to die prematurely.\n\nThe vast majority of the studies in the analysis focused on migration to high-income countries, not on refugees or asylum seekers. Researchers also excluded studies from their analysis that focused just on migrants with serious or chronic health problems or just on maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\nIt may be, however, that migrants in the study were healthier than people in their native countries who didn't migrate, said Anjali Borhade, director of the Disha Foundation in Gurugram, India, and co-author of an editorial accompanying the study.\n\n\"Educated migrants have better sources of income and being healthy doesn't affect their choice to migrate,\" Borhade said by email. \"Also, educated migrants have better living or working conditions and their health status is similar to the host populations, both for risks as well as outcomes.\"\n\nInfectious disease and homicide deaths may be higher among migrants than other people in the general population because of unfavorable conditions immigrants face at work and in their new communities, Borhade added. That's because many young, relatively healthy migrants may take low-paying and dangerous jobs and only be able to afford housing in subpar conditions.\n\n\"Hazardous jobs and low living conditions increase their risk of dying due to external causes and infectious diseases,\" Borhade said. \"However, since migrants are healthier to begin with, their mortality due to other causes might be lower.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Zuckerberg Sees 'Progress' for Facebook After Tumultuous Year", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/zuckerberg-sees-progress-for-facebook-after-tumultuous-year-/4720277.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said Friday that the world's biggest social network has \"fundamentally\" changed to focus on securing its systems against manipulation and misinformation.\n\n\n\nCapping a tumultuous year marked by data protection scandals and government probes, Zuckerberg said he was \"proud of the progress we've made\" in addressing Facebook's problems.\n\n\n\n\"For 2018, my personal challenge has been to focus on addressing some of the most important issues facing our community \u2014 whether that's preventing election interference, stopping the spread of hate speech and misinformation, making sure people have control of their information, and ensuring our services improve people's well-being,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\n\n\n\"We're a very different company today than we were in 2016, or even a year ago.

Mark Milley, said in May at a Senate hearing where he appealed for more money to modernize the force.\n\nMilley warned that adversaries like China and Russia \u201care investing heavily and very quickly\u201d in the use of aerial, sea and ground robots. And now, he added, \u201cwe are doing the same.\u201d\n\nSuch a shift will be a \u201chuge game-changer for combat,\u201d said Scharre, who credits Milley's leadership for the push.\n\nThe promise of such big Pentagon investments in robotics has been a boon for U.S. defense contractors and technology startups. But the situation is murkier for firms with foreign ties.\n\nConcerns that popular commercial drones made by Chinese company DJI could be vulnerable to spying led the Army to ban their use by soldiers in 2017. And in August, the Pentagon published a report that said China is conducting espionage to acquire foreign military technologies \u2014 sometimes by using students or researchers as \u201cprocurement agents and intermediaries.\u201d At a December defense expo in Egypt, some U.S. firms spotted what they viewed as Chinese knock-offs of their robots.\n\nThe China fears came to a head in a bitter competition between Israeli firm Roboteam and Massachusetts-based Endeavor Robotics over a series of major contracts to build the Army's next generation of ground robots. Those machines will be designed to be smarter and easier to deploy than the remote-controlled rovers that have helped troops disable bombs for more than 15 years.\n\nThe biggest contract \u2014 worth $429 million \u2014 calls for mass producing 25-pound robots that are light, easily maneuverable and can be \u201ccarried by infantry for long distances without taxing the soldier,\u201d said Bryan McVeigh, project manager for force projection at the Army's research and contracting center in Warren, Michigan.\n\nOther bulkier prototypes are tank-sized unmanned supply vehicles that have been tested in recent weeks in the rough and wintry terrain outside Fort Drum, New York.\n\nA third $100 million contract \u2014 won by Endeavor in late 2017 \u2014 is for a midsized reconnaissance and bomb-disabling robot nicknamed the Centaur.\n\nThe competition escalated into a legal fight when Roboteam accused Endeavor, a spinoff of iRobot, which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners, of dooming its prospects for those contracts by hiring a lobbying firm that spread false information to politicians about the Israeli firm's Chinese investors.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Roboteam's lawsuit in April.\n\n\u201cThey alleged that we had somehow defamed them,\u201d said Endeavor CEO Sean Bielat, a former Marine who twice ran for Congress as a Republican. \u201cWhat we had done was taken publicly available documents and presented them to members of Congress because we think there's a reason to be concerned about Chinese influence on defense technologies.\u201d\n\nThe lobbying firm, Boston-based Sachem Strategies, circulated a memo to members of the House Armed Services Committee. Taking up Endeavor's cause was Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat \u2014 and, like Bielat, a Marine veteran \u2014 who wrote a letter to a top military official in December 2016 urging the Army to \u201cexamine the evidence of Chinese influence\u201d before awarding the robot contracts.\n\nSix other lawmakers later raised similar concerns.\n\nRoboteam CEO Elad Levy declined to comment on the dispute but said the firm is still \u201cworking very closely with U.S. forces,\u201d including the Air Force, and other countries. But it's no longer in the running for the lucrative Army opportunities.\n\nEndeavor is. Looking something like a miniature forklift on tank treads, its prototype called the Scorpion has been zipping around a test track behind an office park in a Boston suburb.\n\nThe only other finalist is just 20 miles away at the former Massachusetts headquarters of Foster-Miller, now a part of British defense contractor Qinetiq. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The contract is expected to be awarded in early 2019.\n\nBoth Endeavor and Qinetiq have strong track records with the U.S. military, having supplied it with its earlier generation of ground robots such as Endeavor's Packbot and Qinetiq's Talon and Dragon Runner.\n\nAfter hiding the Scorpion behind a shroud at a recent Army conference, Bielat and engineers at Endeavor showed it for the first time publicly to The Associated Press in November. Using a touchscreen controller that taps into the machine's multiple cameras, an engineer navigated it through tunnels, over a playground-like structure and through an icy pool of water, and used its grabber to pick up objects.\n\nIt's a smaller version of its predecessor, the Packbot, which was first used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2002 and later became one of soldiers' essential tools for safely disabling improvised explosives in Iraq. Bielat said the newer Scorpion and Centaur robots are designed to be easier for the average soldier to use quickly without advanced technical training.\n\n\u201cTheir primary job is to be a rifle squad member,\u201d Bielat said. \u201cThey don't have time to mess with the robot. They're going to demand greater levels of autonomy.\u201d\n\nIt will be a while, however, before any of these robots become fully autonomous. The Defense Department is cautious about developing battlefield machines that make their own decisions. That sets the U.S. apart from efforts by China and Russia to design artificially intelligent warfighting arsenals.\n\nA November report from the Congressional Research Service said that despite the Pentagon's \u201cinsistence\u201d that a human must always be in the loop, the military could soon feel compelled to develop fully autonomous systems if rivals do the same. Or, as with drones, humans will still pull the trigger, but a far-away robot will lob the bombs.\n\nSaid P.W. Singer, a strategist for the New America Foundation think tank: \u201cChina has showed off armed ones. Russia has showed them off. It's coming.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Cybersecurity Law: Vietnam Will Censor Internet, Not Close Websites", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cybersecurity-law-vietnam-will-censor-internet-not-close-websites/4719474.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Expect to get caught if you post anti-government material on the internet in Vietnam or take a phishing trip. From 2019 authorities can build evidence against you from material provided by email services and social media networks including Facebook. Yet the country, mindful of its role in the emerging digital economy, won\u2019t close down websites the way China does.\n\nVietnam has long walked a thin line between a free internet as part of its economic growth and resistance against what market research firm IDC\u2019s country manager Lam Nguyen calls \u201cdigital disasters.\u201d The country is getting testier toward online dissent at the same time.\n\nA draft Cybersecurity Law decree to take effect Jan. 1 after 18 months in the making will help the communist government reach these goals by ordering service providers to do some of its surveillance work.\n\nDespite objections from Google and Facebook, global social media as well as email and e-commerce providers may be asked to store data in Vietnam, according to the Cybersecurity Law. Alternately, they can self-censor, turn over customer profiles and delete certain content, Nguyen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying OK, as an online service provider with Vietnam users, you do collect data about such users and their online activities, but you are letting users use your platform or services for unlawful activities, so please come to the front of the line (so) that we can keep an eye out for you,\u201d said Yee Chung Seck, partner with the Baker McKenzie law firm in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nCatching up in cybersecurity\n\nAccording to a United Nations index, Vietnam ranked 101 out of 165 countries in exposure to cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cVietnam has been historically weak when in it comes to cybersecurity,\u201d cyber intelligence analyst Emilio Iasiello wrote in a commentary for the Cyber Research Databank.\n\nDomestic websites were hit by more than 6,500 malware or phishing attacks in the first eight months of 2018, Viet Nam News reports.\n\nVietnam does not block the websites of foreign internet services that could spread objectionable content. Vietnam, like much of Asia, is trying to develop a digital economy, but unlike China it lacks easy-to-control homegrown alternates to the major Silicon Valley internet firms.\n\n\u201cObviously, the business and user communities are more likely hoping to avoid censorship of the internet outright, due to the growing digital commerce economy and also wanting a platform where freedom of expressions and opinions are allowed,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nA digital economy gives Vietnam an opportunity to resolve \u201cbig issues in its economic development,\u201d the deputy minister of industry and trade was quoted saying in June. The manufacturing-reliant economy has grown 6 to 7 percent per year since 2012.\n\nAbout 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s 92 million people use the internet, with 53 million on social media sites.\n\nProtest from multinational internet content providers\n\nAfter Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly approved the Cybersecurity Law in June, 17 U.S. congressional representatives sent a letter to Google and Facebook. They urged both to avoid storing data in Vietnam, to establish \u201ctransparent guidelines\u201d on content removal and to publish the number of requests for removal.\n\nFacebook, Google and other foreign internet companies said earlier this month via a lobbying group that requirements to localize data would hobble investment and economic growth in Vietnam. The law also requires firms with more than 10,000 local users to set up local representative offices.\n\nFacebook said for this report it \u201cremains committed to its community in Vietnam and in helping Vietnamese businesses grow at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nInternet providers also worry the cybersecurity law gives \u201ctoo much power\u201d to Vietnam\u2019s police ministry and lacks \u201cdue process,\u201d Nguyen said. Authorities, they fear, could \u201cseize customer data\u201d and expose a provider\u2019s users, partners or employees to arrest, which goes against privacy protection policies, he said.\n\n\u200bFear among online activists\n\nVietnam is looking to the cybersecurity law as well to control public criticism of government activity, activist bloggers believe. A string of Vietnamese bloggers was arrested in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAuthorities will be able to collect user names, profiles and data on their friends, media reports and analysts say.\n\n\u201cThis law threatens and further curbs freedom to information, infringes (on) personal privacy, and will be certainly used as a tool to give more power to police force, which violates rights, even on behalf of the court on judging on the use of internet,\u201d Hanoi-based internet blogger and human rights activist Nguyen Lan Thang said.\n\nVietnamese activists leaned heavily on internet media to spread information about what they considered slow government reaction to a mass fish die-off in 2016. They use it now to decry corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Cybersecurity Law will have a huge impact on Vietnam\u2019s dissidents and online activists. It will be a tool to silence dissidents, social commentators, and activists in general,\u201d said Vu Quoc Ngu, a writer in Hanoi and director of the non-profit Defend the Defender.\n\nVu Pham, Michelle Quinn of VOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Instagram 'Back to Normal' After Bug Triggers Temporary Change to Feed", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/instagram-back-to-normal-after-bug-triggers-temporary-change-to-feed/4718651.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook Inc\u2019s photo-sharing social network Instagram said on Thursday it has fixed a bug that led to a temporary change in the appearance of its feed for a large number of users.\n\nThe bug led to a small test being distributed widely, the company said.

That's what makes this deep-freeze target so enticing; it's a preserved relic dating all the way back to our solar system's origin 4.5 billion years ago. No spacecraft has visited anything so primitive.\n\n\n\n\"What could be more exciting than that?\" said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University, part of the New Horizons team.\n\n\n\nLead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, expects the New Year's encounter to be riskier and more difficult than the rendezvous with Pluto: The spacecraft is older, the target is smaller, the flyby is closer and the distance from us is greater.\n\n\n\nNew horizons\n\n\n\nNASA launched the spacecraft in 2006; it's about the size of a baby grand piano. It flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the dwarf planet. With the wildly successful flyby behind them, mission planners won an extension from NASA and set their sights on a destination deep inside the Kuiper Belt. As distant as it is, Pluto is barely in the Kuiper Belt, the so-called Twilight Zone stretching beyond Neptune. Ultima Thule is in the Twilight Zone's heart.\n\n\n\nUltima Thule\n\n\n\nThis Kuiper Belt object was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014. Officially known as 2014 MU69, it got the nickname Ultima Thule in an online vote. In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world. When New Horizons first glimpsed the rocky iceball in August it was just a dot. Good close-up pictures should be available the day after the flyby.\n\nAre we there yet ?\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will make its closest approach in the wee hours of Jan. 1 \u2014 12:33 a.m. EST. The spacecraft will zoom within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Ultima Thule, its seven science instruments going full blast. The coast should be clear: Scientists have yet to find any rings or moons around it that could batter the spacecraft. New Horizons hurtles through space at 31,500 mph (50,700 kph), and even something as minuscule as a grain of rice could demolish it. \"There's some danger and some suspense,\" Stern said at a fall meeting of astronomers. It will take about 10 hours to get confirmation that the spacecraft completed \u2014 and survived \u2014 the encounter.\n\n\n\nPossibly twins\n\n\n\nScientists speculate Ultima Thule could be two objects closely orbiting one another. If a solo act, it's likely 20 miles (32 kilometers) long at most. Envision a baked potato. \"Cucumber, whatever. Pick your favorite vegetable,\" said astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins. It could even be two bodies connected by a neck. If twins, each could be 9 miles to 12 miles (15 kilometers to 20 kilometers) in diameter.\n\n\n\nMapping mission\n\n\n\nScientists will map Ultima Thule every possible way. They anticipate impact craters, possibly also pits and sinkholes, but its surface also could prove to be smooth. As for color, Ultima Thule should be darker than coal, burned by eons of cosmic rays, with a reddish hue. Nothing is certain, though, including its orbit, so big that it takes almost 300 of our Earth years to circle the sun. Scientists say they know just enough about the orbit to intercept it.\n\n\n\nComparing flybys\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will get considerably closer to Ultima Thule than it did to Pluto: 2,220 miles versus 7,770 miles (3,500 kilometers vs. 12,500 kilometers). At the same time, Ultima Thule is 100 times smaller than Pluto and therefore harder to track, making everything more challenging. It took 4 { hours, each way, for flight controllers at Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, to get a message to or from New Horizons at Pluto. Compare that with more than six hours at Ultima Thule.\n\n\n\nWhat's next\n\n\n\nIt will take almost two years for New Horizons to beam back all its data on Ultima Thule. A flyby of an even more distant world could be in the offing in the 2020s, if NASA approves another mission extension and the spacecraft remains healthy. At the very least, the nuclear-powered New Horizons will continue to observe objects from afar, as it pushes deeper into the Kuiper Belt. There are countless objects out there, waiting to be explored."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Amos Oz, Israeli Author, Dead At 79", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amos-oz-dead-cancer-author_us_5c264bd5e4b08aaf7a900acc", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli author Amos Oz, one of the country\u2019s pre-eminent and widely acclaimed writers, died on Friday after a battle with cancer, his family announced.

They spoke to university officials about it. McCluskey herself reached out to the university and police multiple times. But nobody stopped the man who eventually killed her, two new reports reveal.\n\nOn Oct. 22, the 21-year-old senior was fatally shot by 37-year-old Melvin Rowland in a parking lot outside a residence hall. After a short police chase on foot, law enforcement said Rowland was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nA convicted sex offender who spent over a decade in prison, Rowland had lied to McCluskey about himself, attempted to keep her from her friends and at one point tried to extort money from her.\n\nHer friends, family and McCluskey herself had all reached out to authorities for help multiple times, according to reports released earlier this month from the Utah Department of Public Safety and the University of Utah Department of Public Safety.\n\nBut not enough was done to keep the 3.7 GPA student and standout track athlete safe.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS An image of the late student-athlete Lauren McCluskey is projected on the video board at the University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium before the start of an NCAA match on Nov. 10, 2018.\n\nThe following account is drawn from the two reports.\n\nOn Sept. 30, two of McCluskey\u2019s friends spoke to a university resident adviser to say they were \u201cvery concerned that Lauren is in an unhealthy relationship with an older man who was controlling her,\u201d according to the university\u2019s report. The friends sought help days after McCluskey told them she was sad because Rowland, whom she had met just a month prior at a sports bar, would no longer let her \u201chang out with friends.\u201d\n\nThe university ultimately decided not to \u201coverstep\u201d in its actions unless McCluskey specifically asked for help.\n\nMore than a week later, McCluskey broke off her relationship with Rowland after discovering that he had lied about his name, age and criminal history. He told her that he simply had \u201cmany identities,\u201d according to the university\u2019s report. Following the breakup, Rowland sent her a text suggesting she \u201cgo kill yourself.\u201d\n\nOn Oct 10, McCluskey\u2019s mother called university dispatch and sounded \u201cvery upset and worried\u201d that her daughter was going to try to get her car back from Rowland. A campus security officers accompanied McCluskey to retrieve the car and no major incident took place.\n\nTwo days later, McCluskey began receiving texts claiming that Rowland was in the hospital or dead. She believed this to be a trap and contacted the University Department of Public Safety, which ultimately decided there \u201cwas not much that could be done,\u201d according to the state\u2019s report. She called again the next day, Oct. 13, this time to report that Rowland was threatening to release embarrassing images of her publicly if she didn\u2019t pay him $1,000.\n\nThat same day, she also made a 911 call to the Salt Lake City Police Department about the extortion. They referred her to the university\u2019s public safety department, who assigned a detective to the case and took a report from McCluskey. The university police told her it would be a difficult case because the messages she had received came from different numbers and email addresses.\n\nOn Oct. 15, McCluskey saw her on-campus counselor.\n\nOn Oct. 19, she made another 911 call to the Salt Lake City police again hoping to get an update. Those calls, obtained by KUTV, reveal that McCluskey was worried that campus police were not responding fast enough to her problem.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s report, McCluskey had received an email from an unknown person saying, \u201cWe know everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried because I\u2019ve been working with the campus police at the U and last Saturday I reported and then, I haven\u2019t gotten an update. But someone contacted me today, someone who ... said that they know everything about the police,\u201d McCluskey said in the 911 call on Oct. 19.\n\nOn Oct. 22, she contacted university police again after she received a text from an unknown number in which someone claiming to be a university police detective asked to meet her. She went to see her on-campus counselor again.\n\nLater that night, her father called police to report that his daughter was missing. \u201cShe was abducted while she was on the phone with us,\u201d Matt McCluskey told dispatch.\n\nJill McCluskey, Lauren\u2019s mother, told KUTV that she was on the phone with her daughter, who was walking home just before 9 p.m., when she heard her daughter shout, \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the last I heard from her,\u201d Jill McCluskey said.\n\nThe 21-year-old was found dead that night.\n\nIn its report, the university concluded that it had \u201cidentified gaps in training, awareness and enforcement of certain policies rather than lapses in individual performance.\u201d The report added that \u201cwe will never know that this tragedy could have been prevented without these deficiencies.\u201d\n\nMcCluskey\u2019s parents disagree."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Usher Files For Divorce From Wife Grace Miguel", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/usher-divorce-grace-miguel_us_5c26a9b0e4b0407e90829ce4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Singer Usher announced on Friday that he is divorcing Grace Miguel, his wife of three years.\n\nThe Blast reports that he filed for divorce in Georgia and is using the same attorney he used during his custody battle with his ex-wife, Tameka Foster.\n\nUsher and Miguel married in 2015, six years after they started dating.

The moon will be completely covered by the Earth\u2019s shadow and take on a reddish tint \u2015 hence the nickname blood moon. NASA calculates there will be 85 total lunar eclipses this century.\n\nThe eclipse will also happen near the moon\u2019s perigee, a point in its orbit when it is closest to the Earth. This means the moon will appear slightly brighter and bigger than usual, known as a supermoon.\n\nPetros Giannakouris/ASSOCIATED PRESS On Jan. 31, 2018, a super blue blood moon rose behind the 2,500-year-old Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens.\n\nFinally, January\u2019s full moon is traditionally called a wolf moon in the United States, according to The Farmer\u2019s Almanac. Other cultures have different names for the full moons that occur throughout the year.\n\nResidents of the U.S. were unable to see the longest full blood moon of the 21st century in July. It was visible only over parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. A rare super blue blood moon, which occurs when a super blood moon is also the second full moon of the month, occurred in January 2018. In the United States, that celestial event was most visible to people on the West Coast, Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nCourtesy NASA A NASA graph shows the regions of the world where the total lunar eclipse of Jan. 20-21 will be most visible.\n\nIn contrast, January\u2019s super blood wolf moon will be visible from coast to coast in the U.S. mainland, depending on weather conditions. People in Hawaii may also be able to see the eclipse while the moon is rising.\n\nThe super blood wolf moon will also be visible to people in South America and in the western parts of Europe and Africa."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "No One Has Claimed That $1.5 Billion Lotto Jackpot, And The Clock Is Ticking", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/billion-mega-millions-lottery-unclaimed_us_5c268307e4b0407e90827aaf", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Someone, somewhere could lay claim to that $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot from October: We know the sole winning ticket was sold at a grocery store in Simpsonville, South Carolina.\n\nBut as of Friday no one had come forward to claim the prize, HuffPost confirmed with the South Carolina Education Lottery.\n\nThe mystery almost-billionaire (the winnings would net out to around $900 million after taxes) has 180 days from the drawing date to claim the pot, said Josh Whiteside, director of marketing for the South Carolina Education Lottery. That would put the deadline to redeem it at April 21.\n\nIf it goes unclaimed, the money will be returned to each of the 44 states (plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands) that participate in the Mega Millions lottery.\n\nSouth Carolina, for example, would receive about $11 million, according to local newspaper The State, with the money going into the state\u2019s education fund. Each state determines for itself what to do with unclaimed lottery money. Some funnel it into other lottery games. In Georgia, a portion of unclaimed money goes toward treatment for those with gambling addictions.\n\nAnd, yes, people do take their sweet time contacting the lottery commissions on occasion. In March 2017, a Wisconsin woman bought a winning $156 million Powerball ticket but did not come forward until the end of July that year. Had she not claimed the prize, the money would have gone toward property tax relief in her state.\n\nBut South Carolina lottery spokeswoman Holli Armstrong told The State that the October winner\u2019s silence was \u201cunusual,\u201d considering the massive sum.\n\nPerhaps the winner is simply figuring out how and when to get back to South Carolina \u2015 The State theorized that the grocery store\u2019s location could have meant someone bought a ticket and continued along one of two nearby highways out of state.

First lady Melania Trump flew there Thursday.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Is it worse to disappoint your rich, dues-paying club members who have shelled out $1,000 a ticket to mingle with you at your Palm Beach resort\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party?\n\nOr to attend and have photographs taken of your Secret Service detail protecting you amid the Champagne and caviar while they worry about their next paycheck?\n\nSuch are the horns of the dilemma President Donald Trump faces in the coming days because of the partial government shutdown he forced in an attempt to get billions of American taxpayer dollars to build his border wall \u2014 a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for.\n\n\u201cFor any normal president, travel to Mar-a-Lago would be completely out of the question,\u201d said Norm Eisen, who was a White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama and is now chairman of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cBut then, any normal president would not be operating a for-profit resort to benefit himself, selling memberships at that resort to those with special interests before his White House and then squeezing extra money out of those people for a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\u201d\n\nWhether Trump winds up going to Florida is not known and perhaps \u2014 given his track record \u2014 not knowable until the party is underway. First lady Melania Trump flew to Palm Beach via Air Force jet Thursday, and his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both White House advisers, were spotted there earlier in the week.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Fox News on Friday morning that the president would remain in Washington. \u201cHe\u2019s canceled his plans for Christmas. Now he\u2019s canceled his plans for New Year\u2019s,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nAt the same time, though, Mulvaney and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the shutdown is continuing into its second week only because House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would endanger her expected return to the speakership if she cut a deal with Trump before that election on Jan. 3.\n\nFor any normal president, travel to Mar-a-Lago would be completely out of the question. But then, any normal president would not be operating a for-profit resort to benefit himself, selling memberships at that resort to those with special interests before his White House and then squeezing extra money out of those people for a New Year\u2019s Eve party. Norm Eisen, chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi is only looking to protect her speakership, and not protect our borders,\u201d Sanders told CBS News.\n\nThat coordinated messaging could be laying the groundwork for Trump\u2019s eventual travel to Mar-a-Lago in time to attend his party, with the rationale that he can just as effectively wait for Pelosi to become speaker in Florida as he can in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be amazed by anything,\u201d said Eisen, whose group is suing to get access to Mar-a-Lago\u2019s visitor logs. \u201cOne thing we have learned from Trump is that he defies the conventional wisdom even when it\u2019s completely self-destructive.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s office, meanwhile, ridiculed the White House\u2019s attempt to blame her. \u201cDemocrats are united against the president\u2019s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall \u2014 the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for,\u201d said Pelosi aide Drew Hammill. \u201cDemocrats have made it clear that, given that the president has changed his position so many times, we would not consider any offers from the White House that the president has not publicly endorsed. While we await the president\u2019s public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service is among the agencies whose funding ran out at midnight Dec. 21. About a quarter of the federal government is in that category, affecting some 800,000 employees in all \u2014 half of whom were furloughed, while the other half, deemed essential, must work anyway. Neither group will see another paycheck until Trump has signed legislation that resumes funding.\n\nThose without enough savings on hand will be forced to borrow to pay the bills in the meantime. Trump\u2019s Office of Personnel Management, in fact, issued some pointers to employees facing trouble, such as performing maintenance chores \u201cin exchange for partial rent payments.\u201d\n\nTrump promised during his campaign that he would remove himself from his family business if he was elected, but reneged on that before he took office. He continues to personally profit from the hotels and golf courses he owns, including ones he frequents in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.\n\nMar-a-Lago, his bayfront resort in Palm Beach, doubled its initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000 after his election. Annual dues will rise about $1,000 next year, to $16,000, according to a report in The Palm Beach Post.\n\nTickets to his members-and-guests-only New Year\u2019s Eve party have also gotten much pricier. In 2016 they were $525 each for members and $575 for their guests. Those prices jumped to $600 and $750 last year, and $650 and $1,000 for Monday night\u2019s party. And those amounts do not include a mandatory 20 percent gratuity and 7 percent sales tax.\n\nThe Secret Service has already spent $54,020 renting tents for use at the party, according to a report in Quartz. They are typically used as shelters where agents can screen guests before they enter the grounds.\n\nAt a similar party at the resort early in Trump\u2019s presidency, a guest photographed and posted to social media the aide who accompanies Trump and carries codes for nuclear war plans as well as a dinner table meeting of Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the time North Korea had just test-fired a missile.\n\nThe White House later claimed that no classified information was discussed at the meeting.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House had indicated he would sign a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through Feb. 8. But he changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts criticized him for caving on his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Twitter Briefly Thought Melania Trump Went Pantsless", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-not-wearing-pants_us_5c267eaee4b0407e9082759a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "All eyes were on Melania Trump as she and President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Thursday following an unannounced trip to Iraq to meet with troops.\n\nTo many, it appeared that the first lady was only wearing her bright green Prada coat, which retails for around $2,500, thanks to odd lighting when she emerged from the presidential aircraft.\n\nThough Melania was wearing caramel-colored pants and matching shoes, some thought that she was indeed pantsless:\n\nICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive at the White House on Thursday as they return from an unannounced trip to Iraq.\n\nEvan Vucci/ASSOCIATED PRESS Donald and Melania Trump arrive on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday after making a surprise visit to troops in Iraq.\n\nOf course, people on Twitter had a lot of thoughts about the look, and some admitted to doing a double take when they first saw the pictures:\n\nIs it me?!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2018\n\n\u201cThis struck me as like an angry eighth-grader\u2019s tweet,\u201d Costello said on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to make sense of it because I don\u2019t think he can do this even if he wanted to. It probably violates NAFTA. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have much if any support in Congress. Nor do I think logistically he\u2019d be able to implement it.\n\n\u201cAnd when you start throwing out vacuous threats like this, people stop taking you seriously in terms of how you go about negotiating.\u201d\n\nCostello, who announced in May that he would not run for re-election, tweeted earlier this month that Trump\u2019s political pressure on the Democrats just as they are about to take control of the House was \u201ctoddler logic.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump is blaming the Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, he was the one who refused to sign a temporary spending measure until he gets billions of dollars for his border wall, a signature campaign promise. He said earlier this month he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government for \u201cborder security.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, the president said that this is his shutdown,\u201d Costello said. Now it\u2019s not \u201cclear on what amount of money he needs in order to sign a funding bill,\u201d he added. \u201cThe ball\u2019s in the president\u2019s court, and we have no clarity on what he\u2019s willing to accept or what he might sign.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Taxpayers Dish Out $54,000 For Mar-a-Lago Party Tents For New Year's Eve", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-mar-a-lago-party-tents-government-shutdown_us_5c26e042e4b0407e9082b572", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Whether or not President Donald Trump ultimately decides to party with supporters on New Year\u2019s Eve at his private Mar-a-Lago golf resort, taxpayers have already paid $54,000 for tents for the bash, according to government spending records.\n\nThe tab for the party tents has been picked up by the public even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers are out of work thanks to a partial government shutdown triggered by the president\u2019s refusal to sign a spending measure until it includes billions of dollars to build his border wall.\n\nGrimes Events & Party Tents Inc. of Delray Beach, Florida, was paid $54,020 on Dec. 19 by the Secret Service for \u201cTent Rental for MAL,\u201d according to spending records revealed by Quartz.

Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind the assisted living facility in 2016.\n\nBy Jordan Rau\n\nThey found Bonnie Walker\u2019s body floating in a pond behind her assisted living facility in South Carolina. There were puncture wounds on her ear, temple, jaw and cheeks.\n\nBut her right forearm and pacemaker were missing. Later, they were found inside one of the alligators in the pond.\n\nLike 4 in 10 residents in assisted living facilities, Walker, 90, had dementia. Shortly after midnight one day in July 2016, she slipped out of her facility, Brookdale Charleston, as she had done a few days before. This time, no one noticed her missing for seven hours.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to pass away that way,\u201d her granddaughter Stephanie Weaver said.\n\nAssisted living facilities were originally designed for people who were largely independent but required help bathing, eating or with other daily tasks. Unlike nursing homes, the facilities generally do not provide skilled medical care or therapy, and stays are not paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nDementia care is the fastest-growing segment of assisted living. An increasing number of residences are built to cater to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia. But across the country, many of them are also struggling to deliver on their promises of security and attentive care, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of inspection records in the three most populous states.\n\nIn California, 45 percent of assisted living facilities have violated one or more state dementia regulations during the past five years. Three of the 12 most common California citations in 2017 were related to dementia care.\n\nIn Florida, one in 11 assisted living facilities have been cited since 2013 for not meeting state rules designed to prevent residents from wandering away.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A sign near the pond behind Brookdale Charleston, an assisted living facility in South Carolina, warns about the potential risk of alligators.\n\nAnd in Texas, nearly a quarter of the facilities that accept residents with Alzheimer\u2019s have violated one or more state rules, such as creating a plan of care for each resident with dementia upon admission or ensuring that staff members have completed special training, according to nearly six years of records.\n\n\u201cThere is a belief in our office that many facilities do not staff to the level\u201d necessary to meet the unanticipated \u201cneeds of residents, especially medical needs,\u201d said Fred Steele, Oregon\u2019s long-term care ombudsman. \u201cMany of these are for-profit entities. They are setting staffing ratios that maybe aren\u2019t being set because of the care needs of the residents but are more about the bottom line of their profits.\u201d\n\nUneven regulation\n\nThese concerns, though particularly acute for people with dementia, apply to all assisted living residents. They are older and frailer than assisted living residents were a generation ago. Within a year, one in five experience a fall, one in eight visit an emergency room and one in 12 have an overnight hospital stay, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Half are 85 or older.\n\n\u201cAssisted living was created to be an alternative to nursing homes, but if you walk into some of the big assisted living facilities, they sure feel like a nursing home,\u201d said Doug Pace, director for mission partnerships with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nYet the rules for assisted living remain looser than for nursing homes. The federal government does not license or oversee assisted living facilities, and some states set tougher rules than others.\n\nThe government does not publish quality measures as it does for nursing homes. Inspections usually are less frequent, and fines are generally far lower than what a nursing home might incur for a similar mistake.\n\nLindsay Schwartz, an associate vice president at the National Center for Assisted Living, an industry group, said facilities often juggle what could be conflicting goals at times, such as ensuring the safety of their residents without overly restricting their movement and the ability to socialize.\n\n\u201cDementia is a difficult disease,\u201d she said. \u201cFreedom of movement is incredibly important for overall health, mind, body and spirit. You can\u2019t keep people in isolation.\u201d\n\nIndustry official say rigid government regulations don\u2019t mesh with the individual approaches that assisted living facilities aspire to create for residents.\n\nBut residents\u2019 families, their lawyers and advocates say the violent behavior of agitated residents and escapes could be avoided if there are regulations to ensure better training and more staffing. Eliza Cantwell, a lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina, said too many facilities were accepting residents they weren\u2019t prepared to adequately care for because they wanted to maximize their income.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the qualified personnel to take care of these people, and they\u2019re taking care of them anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nCantwell is representing Weaver in a suit against Brookdale for emotional distress, which Weaver says came from being among the first people to discover her grandmother\u2019s body. Brookdale has already settled a wrongful-death claim from Bonnie Walker\u2019s estate.\n\nThe company declined to discuss Weaver\u2019s lawsuit and said in a statement that \u201cour everyday focus and priority is to keep residents safe.\u201d Brookdale called Walker\u2019s death \u201can unfortunate accident\u201d and said it has retrained its staff.\n\nA year after Walker\u2019s death, after four inspections, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale for 11 violations, including not properly performing night checks and letting staffing drop below required levels. The penalty: $6,400.\n\n\u201cI worked as a law enforcement agent for the Department of Natural Resources, and I\u2019ve written wildlife tickets larger than what DHEC did,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThis was nothing.\u201d\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN Stephanie Weaver holds a photo of her grandmother, Bonnie Walker. Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind her assisted living facility in 2016.\n\n\u2018Get him away from me\u2019\n\nNearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s 30,000 assisted living facilities either house only people with dementia or have special areas known as memory care units. These wings have locked doors and other safeguards to prevent residents from leaving. The facilities often train staff members in techniques to manage behavior related to these diseases and provide activities to keep the residents engaged and stimulated.\n\nThese units usually are more expensive, with monthly costs averaging $6,472, compared with $4,835 for regular assisted living, according to a survey by the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, a group that analyzes elder care market trends. Senior housing investors earned nearly 15 percent in annual returns over the past five years, higher than for apartment, hotel, office and retail properties, according to the center. Beth Burnham Mace, chief economist at the center, said memory care unit construction was outpacing all other types of senior housing.\n\nAggressive behavior, a hallmark of dementia, is a major problem in assisted living facilities. One national study, published in 2016, found that 8 percent of assisted living residents were physically aggressive or abusive toward other residents or staff.\n\nIn the dementia unit of The Point at Rockridge, an assisted living facility in Oakland, California, a resident identified in court papers as Ian began to follow another resident, Olivia Deloney, an 88-year-old with dementia. Before retiring, she had been dean of students at a school for the blind.\n\n\u201cThat man is crazy,\u201d one employee recalled Deloney saying, according to the employee\u2019s sworn statement. \u201cGet him away from me.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, Ian grabbed Deloney and threw her to the ground, breaking her right hip, a video shows. When paramedics were putting her into a stretcher, Ian tried to kick her, and the emergency workers had to keep him away, the police report said.\n\nAfterward, the administrators told Deloney\u2019s daughter, Simone Stevens, that they had not known that Ian, a retired university facilities engineer, was dangerous, her lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cThey just made it sound like it was like a freak accident: \u2018He\u2019s really just a calm and likable resident,\u2019\u201d Stevens said in an interview.\n\nA state investigation report said The Point had been trying to address his behavioral problems before the attack. State regulators declined to punish The Point, saying in their report that there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence that the facility had \u201cclear knowledge\u201d Ian would be a danger to other residents.\n\nBut when Stevens sued The Point, her lawyer, Felicia Curran, discovered that Ian\u2019s agitated behavior, including pushing and shoving, had been the reason his wife initially placed him there. At The Point, he had punched one aide in the shoulders, grabbed another by the neck and jumped on a third and beaten her, employees said in statements taken by Curran.\n\n\u201cIt was an everyday thing for him to chase staff and be physically aggressive,\u201d one declared. Aides posted a photo of him in their kitchen, warning colleagues to watch out for his violent outbursts, and employees once locked themselves in bathrooms for protection, according to records in the case.\n\n\u201cThey should have never had him there in the first place,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A year after Bonnie Walker\u2019s death in 2016, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale $6,400 for 11 violations.\n\nTracee DeGrande, the president of Integral Senior Living, which owns The Point, wrote in a statement that the episode was not typical. \u201cOur staff associates work hard to care for residents, many of whom would have nowhere to go if we didn\u2019t provide a place for those living with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAfter the attack, The Point evicted Ian. Deloney returned to the facility, but, less stable after surgery, she fell and broke her hip again. She stopped eating and died that December, according to her family\u2019s lawsuit, which blamed The Point for not increasing supervision in light of Deloney\u2019s weakened state.\n\nThe Point paid $1.9 million to settle the case. DeGrande wrote that the \u201csettlement was in no way an admission of responsibility for what ended up as a difficult and sad situation.\u201d\n\nTo calm agitated residents, some facilities are too reliant on psychotropic drugs, which carry increased risk of strokes, falls and confusion. An in-progress study funded by the National Institutes of Health has discovered that 27 percent of residents with dementia take an antipsychotic medication, and most lack documentation assuring the drugs are justified, said the lead investigator, Sheryl Zimmerman, a health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nZimmerman said such drugs are often not necessary if residents are cared for by experienced aides who can de-escalate troubling behaviors and know techniques that engage and soothe those with dementia. But she said low pay and frequent turnover make that difficult. \u201cThe workforce could be better trained than they are,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nInadequate state oversight?\n\nStaffing and training requirements vary greatly from state to state. A study published in 2016 and led by Paula Carder, a professor at Portland State University, found that only seven states required facilities to have a registered nurse. States required anywhere from two to 30 hours of training for dementia unit workers. A handful of states required no specialized training, according to the study. Carder found that 19 states set minimum staff-to-resident ratios for dementia units, while the others left it to the facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina requires one of the tightest staffing ratios in the nation for dementia units: one worker for every eight residents during the day and evening. But meeting that rule proves challenging for at least one facility, according to a lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, Michele Mullen asserted that Franklin Manor Assisted Living in Youngsville, North Carolina, did not meet the state\u2019s staffing minimums on a third of the days her mother, Claire Murphy, lived there in 2015 and 2016.\n\nShe said she would find her mother with her pants wet with urine all the way down to her knees, according to a deposition she gave in the lawsuit. Mullen said aides had repeatedly misplaced her mother\u2019s walker. She would see her mother holding onto the hallway railing as she tried to get to her room. On New Year\u2019s Day in 2016, her mother fell and was hospitalized for a fractured arm.\n\nGregory Nicoluzakis, the general counsel for Saber Healthcare Group, which owns Franklin Manor, said in an email that Mullen\u2019s allegations were inaccurate. \u201cWe believe it is telling that Ms. Mullen admitted her mother to our facilities on three separate occasions despite having the choice of other providers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDrew Hathaway, an attorney for Mullen, said there were no better alternatives nearby that had memory care units. \u201cThere are not that many facilities in these rural areas,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sad reality.\u201d\n\nFranklin Manor was fined in 2016 for not following doctors\u2019 orders that two residents needed to use walkers. In February, the state cited it for not supervising five residents, all with histories of falling, who had fallen and injured themselves. Nicoluzakis said Franklin Manor was in compliance with state regulations.\n\nMullen ultimately removed her mother from Franklin Manor; Murphy died last December.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018Mom needs to go to the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018Mom needs help with this,\u2019\u201d Mullen recalled in her deposition. \u201cAnd they would look at me and actually say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it?\u2019\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This Is What It's Like To Watch Someone You Love Die From ALS", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/als-caretaking_us_5c0fed55e4b08bcb27ed3b19", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "In May 2009, my mom came to visit me just before I graduated from law school. My dad and sisters were scheduled to arrive a couple of days later. The day after she arrived, I met her for lunch.\n\nMy mom had been undergoing medical tests for several months because her speech had started to be slurred and several other mysterious symptoms had presented themselves over the past few years. When I asked her if the doctors had discovered the cause of her symptoms, she blurted out, \u201cThe neurologist thinks that I have ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]. I\u2019m scared to die this way. Eventually, I will be unable to speak and eat on my own. ... I will never make it to your wedding.\u201d\n\nI froze in my chair. The words were barely sinking in. The way she looked that day \u2015 her shocking weight loss and the visible despair on her face \u2015 is still etched into my brain.\n\nTo understand how devastating it was for my family when my mom was diagnosed with ALS \u2014 a \u201cprogressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord,\u201d according to the ALS Association \u2014 you need to understand my mom, Sarah. For my whole life, for better or worse, she was not like any of the other mothers I knew. She was one of the few female partners in her D.C. law firm and one of the few moms in a senior position. She embarrassed me by yelling out the chorus of Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex\u201d in front of my friends in elementary school, always arrived late and sometimes demonstrated her New York roots by flipping off cab drivers when taking me to school. She was short but athletic and tough. I can count on one hand the number of times that I saw her cry in my life, and I distinctly remember when I was finally old enough to beat her in a running or swimming contest. The most common expression that we heard from her was, \u201cReilly, you are so full of shit,\u201d which was directed at my dad, typically during a debate about politics. I simply could not believe that someone as seemingly invincible and full of life as my mom was now facing a disease that would kill her in just a matter of years, if not sooner.\n\nMy dad painfully recalled how a callous neurologist gleefully exclaimed, \u2018She has ALS!\u2019 to my parents after he finally determined what was wrong with her.\n\nWhen I found out about my mom\u2019s diagnosis, like most people, I knew virtually nothing about ALS. Weeks before my graduation weekend, my dad had badgered me to let him drive me from my law school in Indiana back to D.C., which seemed ridiculous, given my age. But as he drove my car home, I sobbed the whole way. \u201cKatie, please breathe,\u201d he sporadically reminded me as I read every article I could find on Google about ALS. He explained the details of the agonizing process of elimination they underwent to arrive at the diagnosis. He painfully recalled how a callous neurologist gleefully exclaimed, \u201cShe has ALS!\u201d to my parents after he finally determined what was wrong with her. Dad promised we would figure it out. \u201cThese people clearly don\u2019t know my mom. She will beat this,\u201d I declared.\n\nThe timing of my mom\u2019s diagnosis was lucky, in that I had been recently deferred as an associate at a law firm in New York, which enabled me to move in with my parents. Before I learned about my mom\u2019s ALS, a bad breakup was the most intense heartbreak I had experienced in my life. I was not personally familiar with death at all, as all my grandparents had passed before I was even a year old and I never had a close relationship with anyone who had died.\n\nInitially, my mom didn\u2019t want to share the diagnosis with anyone outside our immediate family and a couple of close family friends. We desperately hoped that it was a mistake. So we kept the news tight, leaking it only to select individuals when my mom felt comfortable. It felt like a weighted blanket of shame. For months, although I understood it wasn\u2019t logical, I firmly believed that she would somehow defeat this terminal illness. We would just hunker down as a family and research, fight and win.\n\nMonths later, when we could no longer hide mom\u2019s symptoms, I strategically began to share her diagnosis with friends. Frequently, the person I told was unaware of what exactly ALS was or what it did to its victims, so I would then detail the way that she was going to die \u2015 losing the ability to speak, eat and eventually breathe as all her muscles slowly atrophied while her cognition remained intact. While I said each word out loud, I felt more and more alone as I realized that no one knew or could really understand what we were facing. Each word physically hurt to say. The conversation would usually end with me saying, \u201cNo, there is no cure,\u201d as friends inquired about our treatment plan.\n\nCourtesy of Katie. C. Reilly Reilly with her parents a few years after she was born.\n\nAs time passed, my mom\u2019s voice became more impaired. Initially, as other people had more and more difficulty understanding her, I became her interpreter. It was a duty I carried out with pride. Despite the overwhelming sadness I was experiencing, I felt that my mom and I were more intimately connected when she was sick than we ever had been before, and to me, my ability to understand her slurred speech and make it clear to others exemplified that. When she finally lost her voice and I was unable to fulfill that role anymore, I felt like a failure. Her despondency at being unable to communicate weighed heavily on me. Her inability to speak isolated her even further. I started to hate the sound of the voice from the machine that she was forced to use to talk for her.\n\nMy mom had bulbar ALS, a type of ALS that affects the muscles in the face, neck and chest and usually progresses faster than limb-onset ALS. After losing her voice, my mom\u2019s ability to breathe and then to swallow were the next casualties of the disease\u2019s continued onslaught. She became increasingly dependent on a breathing machine. There were so many nights when my dad, mom and I sat at the dinner table and my mom would randomly choke or spit up water and it soon became clear that she would need a feeding tube to survive. She continued to lose weight, had trouble breathing and spit uncontrollably.\n\nDespite what was happening to her, she remained the woman I knew and loved, and her personality and spirit continued to shine. One day when a friend came to visit, Mom wrote in a note, \u201cIt\u2019s considered polite in China to spit,\u201d and handed it to her friend shortly after she arrived. At another point during her illness, I went to visit a friend who had rented a house in Nicaragua, where I met an Irishman who I was interested in (and is now my husband). Months later, I decided to return to Nicaragua to see him. I was certain that my parents were clueless about the true intentions of my trip, but before I left for the airport, I saw a note from my mom on my suitcase that read, \u201cWho\u2019s the guy?\u201d with a smiley face. She drove her car until just before she died (which I now recognize was quite dangerous), demonstrating her determination to fight for her independence despite her devastating circumstances.\n\nCourtesy of Matt Mendelsohn My family at my sister's wedding in June 2010. The fact that my mom is in the middle of the family is not surprising, given the matriarch she was.\n\nMy mom\u2019s battle against ALS pervaded and consumed my family\u2019s collective life, particularly for my dad and me, who were her primary caretakers. Our house gradually filled with different foods, nutritional products, dietary supplements and medical equipment related to her disease. We tirelessly consulted doctors and advisers regarding new medications or alternative treatments that might offer her some hope or at least a little relief from her symptoms. Still, every time we adjusted to a new unwanted change, another, larger one followed, and as hopeful as we tried to remain, we gradually began to feel completely beaten down by the disease.\n\nBefore long, my mom\u2019s mood began to change too. The woman who once filled the house with the world\u2019s greatest head-thrown-back laugh was now unrecognizably sullen, depressed and quiet. The silence was ominous.\n\nIn June 2010, approximately a year after I found out about her ALS diagnosis, my mom, now physically unrecognizable from her prior self, attended my sister\u2019s wedding. The following month, she had such difficulty breathing that she ended up in the emergency room, where we learned that she had contracted pneumonia. During her first few days in the ER, we planned to take her home, but we were told by hospital staff that we couldn\u2019t, although I was never given any specific reason. My whole family longed to have her discharged so that she could die surrounded by family in a place that she loved, but tragically, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhen we were given the ultimatum by the doctors at the hospital to authorize a tracheotomy on her or watch her die, we knew the decision had already been made. My mom did not want to live dependent on a tracheostomy tube or a wheelchair until her death finally arrived. And because she had been a healthy and active woman, her death was not quick. Days passed, and though we knew she was going to die, there was nothing we could do but watch her as she slowly \u2015 too slowly \u2015 moved toward the end of her life. At one point we pleaded with members of her palliative care team to give her more morphine, and they eventually did, which eased her pain.\n\nBecause she had been a healthy and active woman, her death was not quick. Days passed, and though we knew she was going to die, there was nothing we could do but watch her as she slowly \u2015 too slowly \u2015 moved toward the end of her life.\n\nAfter my mom had been at the hospital for almost two weeks, my sisters decided to go back to our house for the night, so it was just my dad and me in my mom\u2019s hospital room. At one point I took a nap on the floor. I still remember the black bandeau floor-length summer dress that I was wearing and tried to use as a blanket in the excessively air-conditioned hospital room. Around 2 a.m., I randomly woke up and saw my dad, visibly upset, by my mom\u2019s bed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have long,\u201d he told me. I moved to sit next to her bed so he could take a break, and I held her hand. I watched her face for what I think was an hour until her breaths slowed and then stopped. Sixteen months after she was diagnosed, we lost my mom to ALS.\n\nBecause of the particular brutality of ALS, I have fought to remember my mom as she was before the disease and not what it did to her or how it ultimately took her from our lives. After she died, my dad reminded me, \u201cALS did not define her life, Katie.\u201d He was right. She lived a full life with great professional success and family and friends who adored her. But ALS dictated when and how she died. It ransacked her brain, atrophied her muscles and ravaged her happiness, and it has been difficult for me to remember the good times that existed before the disease changed everything.\n\nALS also took a grave toll on my dad. He was diagnosed with cancer a year and a half after my mom died, and his oncologist explained that the disease was likely hastened by how run-down he was from the emotional and physical demands of caring for her. He completed one round of chemotherapy, but when the cancer returned less than two years later, he died within months \u2015 on my mom\u2019s birthday.\n\nThe combination of my dad\u2019s illness and subsequent death and my approach to how I handled my grief stunted my ability to process my experience with ALS. I grappled with the guilt that accompanied the feeling that I should have done more to help my mom \u2015 even though I know there was nothing else I could have done. I was constantly filled with anger and sadness, and I often felt there wasn\u2019t the space to share the ALS memories that haunted me. I felt pressured to accept my mom\u2019s death, to grieve her less and to move on. So I put my head down, worked longer hours and tried to push through. Over time, I felt that my ALS story was not even worthy of being told.\n\nCourtesy of Katie C. Reilly Reilly's mom doing her famous head-thrown-back laugh on a family vacation in the late 1980s.\n\nMore recently, particularly after the birth of my daughter a year and a half ago, I started to share my experience with my mom and her ALS more frequently. With time, I am learning to not hide from those difficult memories and to slowly accept the changes in me that occurred because I was an ALS caretaker. My grief continues to be a part of my life, but for the first time in many years, moments from my family\u2019s life before ALS are slowly resurfacing. On rare occasions, I can almost hear my mom\u2019s laugh, which was so powerful, it filled any room she was in.\n\nAbout 30,000 Americans are currently battling ALS \u2014 about 0.009 percent of the country\u2019s population. The extreme rarity of ALS and the lack of public knowledge about it isolated my family during my mom\u2019s illness and contributed to my social retreat in its aftermath. I hope that sharing my ALS story will bring awareness to the cruelty of this disease that took my mom\u2019s life and perhaps help others who are serving or have served as caretakers to feel less alone on their ALS journey.\n\nKatie C.

Her fiance noticed her yellow eyes and freaked out. And that\u2019s how Haynes knew she had caught the disease so many of her friends already had: hepatitis A.\n\nHepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable disease that attacks the liver and is spread by contaminated fecal matter, is a scourge in developing nations with poor sanitation systems. Imported contaminated food is typically to blame when the disease occurs in developed countries.\n\nBut U.S. cases of the disease have tripled in 2018, and the outbreak has nothing to do with imported food.\n\nHepatitis A is spreading among drug-using and homeless populations, with explosions of the disease moving from California to states such as Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nThe toll has been vast: At least 10,582 people have been reported infected so far this year alone, a large number of whom have required extensive \u2014 and thus expensive \u2014 hospitalizations. Hepatitis A inflicts what feel like severe flu symptoms: nausea, fever, dizziness, overall lethargy and jaundice. Without treatment, severe cases of hepatitis A can cause liver failure. At least 80 people have died from this outbreak.\n\nStates, counties and cities have spent millions to fight their local outbreaks, but the money doesn\u2019t address the root causes of the problem: a decaying public health infrastructure, devastated by years of funding cuts, that can\u2019t fully meet the needs of a population driven to homelessness and devastated by the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I see this hepatitis A outbreak as a symptom of the fraying social safety net,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Charleston and surrounding Kanawha County have been a hotbed of West Virginia's hepatitis A outbreak.\n\n\u2018A New Normal\u2019\n\nBefore 1995, when the hepatitis A vaccine was first licensed in the U.S., about 21,000 Americans were diagnosed with hepatitis A each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2006, the CDC recommended all children be vaccinated, and many states now require that children get the vaccine before attending school.\n\nThe release of the vaccine and the spread of immunization caused the number of new cases of the disease to plummet. For the first two decades after the arrival of the vaccine, most outbreaks of hepatitis A in the U.S. were connected to imported contaminated food sources \u2014 like the 2016 outbreak due to frozen strawberries or the 2013 outbreak from pomegranate seeds. On a much smaller scale, the U.S. has also previously seen surges in cases among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.\n\nSo when San Diego County in California saw a spike in hepatitis A cases starting in late 2016 and there didn\u2019t appear to be an underlying food source, the county was caught by surprise. The county health department discovered the disease was spreading through unsanitary living conditions in tent cities and among drug users who were too old to have been vaccinated before attending school. During the peak of the outbreak that fall, the county sprayed its streets with bleach. The health department launched a massive vaccination campaign, added hand-washing stations and new bathrooms, and handed out human poop bags that people could use to dispose of their waste if they didn\u2019t have regular access to a bathroom.\n\nBy the time San Diego quelled the outbreak at the start of 2018, nearly 600 people had been infected and 20 had died. It was just the beginning.\n\nThe San Diego strain of hepatitis A began to pop up nationwide at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, in Utah and then in Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia. Michigan saw an explosion of a different strain of the disease.\n\nIndiana soon took the drastic step of issuing a travel advisory, suggesting that its residents get vaccinated this spring before heading to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby because of the growing outbreak there.\n\n\u201cDisease doesn\u2019t recognize borders when there are outbreaks in neighboring states,\u201d said Pam Pontones, Indiana\u2019s deputy state health commissioner and state epidemiologist.\n\nAs it continued to move east, the disease spread primarily through the drug-using population. Unsanitary and sometimes transient conditions associated with drug use put that population at risk for exposure to contaminated fecal matter, health departments say. There is also some evidence to suggest a possible connection between the disease and intravenous drug use, according to Dr. Sapna Bamrah Morris, who helps lead the CDC\u2019s response to hepatitis A.\n\n\u201cThese are all the symptoms of the cost and human toll the opioid epidemic is taking,\u201d Rahul Gupta, who was head of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources until November, told HuffPost in September. \u201cIt\u2019s much more a telltale sign of the times we\u2019re in and the large epidemic, the tsunami of communicable disease that can happen.\u201d\n\nWhat made these outbreaks difficult to stop, public health officials say, is that they were hurting the people who are hardest to reach: those who are homeless, transient or using drugs, and who don\u2019t trust the health care system after years of stigmatization.\n\nIf these large hepatitis A outbreaks were happening, for example, on college campuses, you\u2019d probably see a different level of energy around getting resources mobilized to respond to them more comprehensively. Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle\n\nPublic health departments had to partner with homeless shelters, soup kitchens and needle exchanges to find these cases of hepatitis A. They set up vaccine drives, deployed strike forces of nurses and staff across cities, sent out mobile vaccine units to far away rural areas. That all takes time and money and effort \u2014 and the disease is still spreading.\n\n\u201cReaching the at-risk populations that are currently affected is extremely resource intensive and everyone has limitations on the resources they have,\u201d said Morris from the CDC.\n\nHealth departments also have \u201ccompeting priorities,\u201d she said, like the onslaught of the flu season.\n\nDuchin put it a bit more bluntly.\n\n\u201cIf these large hepatitis A outbreaks were happening, for example, on college campuses, you\u2019d probably see a different level of energy around getting resources mobilized to respond to them more comprehensively,\u201d he said.\n\nThe entire outbreak demonstrates how public health is failing people most in need of protection, said Jeffrey Howard, the commissioner of Kentucky\u2019s public health department. When the CDC finally issued an advisory to health departments nationwide in June, cases were nearing 2,000 for the year. Now there are closing in on 11,000.\n\n\u201cIt is always clear that inequities and disparities in health and health outcomes exist \u2014 and they exist across this country,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe have to do a better job of protecting that vulnerable population and I think that\u2019s the responsibility of all of public health.\u201d\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Brenda Parker, who works for West Virginia Health Right, sets up a sign advertising free hepatitis A vaccines as part of a mobile clinic that travels to rural areas around the state.\n\nYet all the while, hepatitis A has continued to spread despite health departments\u2019 efforts. And the problem gets worse as those outbreaks move from urban centers to more rural areas that have less public health infrastructure, Howard said. Kentucky and West Virginia have seen such a pattern and have the worst outbreaks to date with 3,265 cases and 2,137 cases, respectively. They\u2019re still seeing new cases every week.\n\n\u201cMy guess is we\u2019re going to see a new status quo with hepatitis A,\u201d Howard said. \u201cHepatitis A is not going to be as rare a disease as it used to be in this country. It\u2019s probably going to be a new normal.\u201d\n\nDecaying Infrastructure\n\n\u201cAs funding cuts happen all along over years, it\u2019s really the public health infrastructure that erodes,\u201d said Lilly Kan, the senior director for infectious disease and informatics at NACCHO. \u201cIt continues to be a smoldering issue, but then when you have fires like outbreaks like hepatitis A, then it becomes obvious.\u201d\n\nNowhere were the consequences of public health cuts more evident than in West Virginia, where Haynes contracted hepatitis A. The state instituted a 24 percent cut in state aid to public health departments in 2016, and several leadership positions remained unfilled as the outbreak spread across the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to manage, and counties that don\u2019t have our resources cannot,\u201d said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, the physician director at the Cabell-Huntington Health Department. \u201cThe state is overtaxed and is relying on the CDC.\u201d But the CDC, which has competing priorities and a limited budget, can only do so much.\n\nKilkenny told WV Public Radio in 2016 that funding cuts \u201cwould really cripple\u201d surveillance efforts for all sorts of diseases.\n\n\u201cIf we stop watching for those diseases, those diseases will spread, people will get sick and some of those people will die,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Dr. Michael Kilkenny, physician director for the Cabell-Huntington Health Department in West Virginia, has decried cuts to public health funding for years.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s hepatitis A outbreak is now the second-worst in the country. Twelve of the more than 2,000 West Virginians who have been diagnosed with the disease this year have died.\n\nHealth departments across the state have lost key staff; the state currently has an interim commissioner of public health. The staffing issues are particularly dire in Kanawha County-Charleston \u2015 the heart of the outbreak, with 782 cases to date. The chief of clinical services at the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department left this year, as did the chief of administration and the chief of health promotion and wellness, according to the former head of the department. Five administrative assistants were let go due to budget cuts in 2017.\n\nDr. Michael Brumage, the former department head, departed this year amid public backlash over a controversial needle exchange in Charleston that shut down in February. And Brenda Isaac, the president of the county\u2019s health board, resigned in October, saying she had become a \u201clightning rod\u201d in the mayoral race, which was largely a referendum on the needle exchange. The interim head of the city\u2019s public health department is working part-time.\n\n\u201cIt was a really unfortunate set of circumstances that depleted the health department of resources right when they needed it most,\u201d said Brumage, who is now the assistant dean for public health practice and service at the West Virginia University School of Public Health. \u201cEven under the best of circumstances it\u2019s difficult to recruit personnel as funding has been slashed over the years.\u201d\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Dr. Angie Settle leads West Virginia Health Right, which has been instrumental in fighting hepatitis A on the ground in Charleston.\n\nThe Kanawha-Charleston Health Department didn\u2019t move fast enough to combat hepatitis because it was distracted by the fight over the needle exchange, said Dr. Angie Settle, the CEO and executive director of West Virginia Health Right, a free health care clinic in Charleston. The county didn\u2019t ramp up its efforts until new cases were peaking in the summer, added Ellen Allen, the executive director of Covenant House, a day shelter in downtown Charleston. Both organizations have played important roles in fighting the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe requested the health department to come in February, but we felt like we kept it too limited in scope,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe should have gotten our arms around this in the spring.\u201d\n\nHuman Poop Bags\n\nThe primary populations affected by the outbreak \u2014 homeless people and drug users \u2014 are served by Covenant House, which has seen a sharp uptick in people coming through the door as the West Virginia economy has struggled in recent years.\n\nBriana Martin, who manages the needs of people who drop in each day at Covenant House, knows at least 10 people in the day shelter who have been infected. She makes sure to wash her hands after interacting with people who have been exposed to hepatitis A. For those who haven\u2019t been vaccinated against the disease, all it would take to contract hepatitis A would be to shake hands with someone who has it or touch the bathroom door before eating.\n\nThe health department has been handing out bags filled with wipes, a toothbrush, toothpaste, two water bottles, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, gloves, detailed sanitary instructions \u2014 and a poop bag. Over 85 people at Covenant House had received the kits as of September.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Briana Martin, drop-in center manager at Covenant House, shows the bags of hygienic products that are handed out to at-risk populations in Charleston. The green bag is for people to use to clean up their own waste.\n\nBut sanitary problems persist. Allen said her staff often cleans up poop outside the shelter. She has requested more outdoor bathrooms, but nothing has changed \u2014 and the shelter is only open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nIt\u2019s just another sign that things continue to worsen for those without a safety net, according to Allen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in nonprofit work for 11 years now and just the last year the acceleration and the decrease in the well-being of people \u2014 it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nAlmost all of the 20 or so people at Covenant House one afternoon this September said they had heard of hepatitis A. Yellow signs with bold letters urging people to get vaccinated dotted the walls.\n\nHaynes, who asked not to be photographed, was there doing her laundry. A middle-aged man who was visiting the shelter and did not want to be identified said he had a friend who had died after contracting hepatitis A, which complicated his underlying hepatitis B and C. Terrell, a Covenant House visitor who declined to give his last name, sat outside the doors for a few hours before making his way in to tease the staff. But when asked about hepatitis A, he answered quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people about to die of it \u2014 wait till they\u2019re about to die before they go in,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a third-world disease and some shit?\u201d\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Terrell, who is currently homeless, said he has seen the effects of hepatitis A up close.\n\nThe Damage Done\n\nThe financial costs of these outbreaks have been high, and they\u2019re still rising.\n\nSan Diego County estimates it spent $12.5 million to quell its outbreak, which is one-quarter the size of West Virginia\u2019s. Kentucky has allocated $2 million so far to the vaccine alone, which doesn\u2019t even count federal money. The underlying hospitalization costs are astronomical, which Brumage said ends up affecting both hospitals and taxpayers because so many members of the at-risk populations are uninsured.\n\n\u201cThose are very extensive hospitalizations that itself would be several million,\u201d said Gupta, West Virginia\u2019s former public health commissioner.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even begin to account for the other resources, such as time, that public health departments and community partnerships have put toward battling the outbreaks.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost West Virginia Health Right sponsors mobile clinics that deliver hepatitis A vaccinations and HIV testing to rural areas across the state.\n\nAnd news of an outbreak can devastate a local economy.\n\nPopular fast food restaurants in West Virginia have taken a massive hit, said Tri-State Restaurant Association spokesman Mike Kirtner. The organization was formed after Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia saw hepatitis A cases take off. Hepatitis A cases have shut down several restaurants in the Charleston area this year, and Kirtner said one major chain lost 70 percent of its business in a single day after a case of hepatitis A was reported. Waitresses at affected restaurants have seen their tips decrease, Kirtner said, sometimes from as much as $300 a day to just $50.\n\nBlame Game\n\nPoliticians, local TV news and the public have blamed just about everything except the lack of public health funding for the outbreak in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt all came from restaurants,\u201d Danny Jones, Charleston\u2019s outgoing mayor, told HuffPost.\n\nBut none of the West Virginia cases have been traced to food contamination. However, Kirtner said, restaurant workers, who are at much higher risk for the disease, are disproportionately represented among intravenous drug users.\n\nJones also criticized the health department for the outbreak, saying it \u201ccaught it a little late.\u201d But the real problem, he argued, was a \u201cneedle mill\u201d that attracted undesirable people to Charleston.\n\n\u201cToo many free meals drawing people in,\u201d he said.\n\nRhetoric like that \u2014 the idea that services helping the homeless and drug-using people are destroying Charleston \u2014 is becoming more mainstream.\n\nA private Facebook group called \u201cCharleston Has Had Enough\u201d blames \u201cjunkies, bums, thieves, dangerous people, most from out of state,\u201d for the area\u2019s growing problems and encourages users to \u201cpost your photos of troublemakers.\u201d\n\nFacebook\n\nThe group has more than 4,600 members, which is comparable to about 10 percent of the city\u2019s population. Users post unflattering photos of people who appear to be among the area\u2019s homeless and drug users, and some include racist and homophobic captions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving, but in the meantime, I want to feel safe and I want these nasty creatures to leave my car, porch, home and business alone!\u201d one group member wrote recently.\n\nNext Year\u2019s Cases\n\nThat sort of dehumanization of the people most at risk for hepatitis A will make it difficult for public health providers to fight the disease. But there are a few bright spots, said Morris of the CDC.\n\nShe is heartened by the sharing of information among afflicted states, the raised awareness about the issue among health departments nationwide, and the new recommendations from the CDC\u2019s vaccination advisory panel to make hepatitis A vaccination routine for the homeless \u2014 a public health first.\n\nBut Morris said she\u2019s not sure what next year\u2019s case count could look like.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful we may not see the larger outbreaks that we\u2019re seeing currently, but it is very difficult to predict,\u201d she said.\n\nOther public health experts are more pessimistic.\n\n\u201cThere is a good reason to suspect that this will further spread to other states,\u201d Gupta warned. \u201cThis is not yet over.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

About 47 percent of adults hold Mr. Trump responsible for the shutdown, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday. In contrast, about 33 percent blame the Democrats in Congress. The poll was conducted Dec. 21 through 25, mostly after the shutdown went into effect.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions to the contrary, most Democrats support increased funding for border security. Many Senate Democrats, for instance, voted to allocate tens of billions of dollars for security enhancements in 2013, including roughly doubling the size of the border patrol, creating new electronic monitoring systems and even some additional physical barriers at certain points along the border.\n\nBut that money was in the context of a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would have tried to address systemic problems. By contrast, they view Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall as a costly and ineffective proposal. What is more, they have pointed to government accounting documents that show the Trump administration has spent only a fraction of the money allocated by Congress last year for a physical barrier along the border.\n\nWith no endgame in mind, Mr. Trump appears to be boxed in between Democrats who will control the House and have key votes in the Senate and his supporters on the hard right, who have grown more vocal in criticizing him. After administration officials signaled this month that the president was willing to back off his demands for wall funding, the conservative personalities Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh accused the president of being \u201cgutless\u201d and surrendering to Democrats.\n\nTo avoid an immediate hit from his base, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a short-term strategy, celebrating a premature victory when the House passed a short-term funding bill last week that included the money he wanted for more border security.\n\nTypically in spending negotiations, lawmakers join the president in hammering the opposition party over their position. But other than Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who is a close ally of the president, and a handful of arch-conservative House members, most Republican lawmakers have stayed out of the fray. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has held off, saying last week that it was up to Democrats and Mr. Trump to reach a deal and only when they did would he hold a vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we on the Republican side do not want to vote for a bill that the president won\u2019t sign,\u201d Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, told reporters on Thursday after presiding over a minutes-long Senate session."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "A Week Into Government Shutdown, Ire Turns to Fear for Federal Workers", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/us/politics/government-shutdown-workers.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "When the government shutdown began a week ago, many federal workers were more irked than anxious.\n\nThey\u2019re really anxious now.

The poll was conducted Dec. 21 through 25, mostly after the shutdown went into effect.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions to the contrary, most Democrats support increased funding for border security.
