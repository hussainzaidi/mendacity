The prospect of an in-person interview with Trump is also unresolved, although Trump said this week that was \"probably\" off the table.\n\nThe thinking of those in the President's circle is that the new acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker would not approve of a subpoena for a presidential interview if Mueller's team goes that route, according to a source close to the President.\n\nTrump's legal team has signaled they'd fight questions about the transition and Trump's time in the White House on the grounds of executive privilege. Giuliani said they would likely argue that Mueller's team got what they needed on obstruction of justice questions from other witnesses, and if Mueller's team delves deeper into the issue it \"would involve a real intrusion into privilege.\"\n\nBut Giuliani also noted there was a \"gray area legally\" when it came to the presidential transition and executive privilege, since Trump had not yet taken office.\n\nGiuliani described the questions as a law school exam: complex with subset questions. He said the questions included what Trump knew about Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with the Russians at Trump Tower, as well as asking about the President's own comments about dirt on Hillary Clinton following the meeting at Trump Tower and his comments asking Russia to find Clinton's missing emails.\n\nGiuliani said that the special counsel's office had indicated they will respond quickly to Trump's answers \u2014 he said it could be a week to 10 days \u2014 and said they would \"in good faith determine do we really need any more.\"\n\nOne of the delays in returning the response was speculation among Trump's legal team that Mueller would release indictments before Thanksgiving, according to a person who speaks to the President. And they were worried about sending the responses without knowing what Mueller might do in the short term. But in the end, they decided to just send the answers in, the person said.\n\n\"I don't think there's an answer that will surprise them very much,\" Giuliani said of the responses. \"None of the answers have changed.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Beginning in January, House Democrats must investigate Donald Trump's administration -- and they must do so aggressively. President Trump's tenure has raised an unprecedented number of red flags about the abuse of power that might be taking place inside the executive branch.\n\nJulian Zelizer\n\nThe questions seem unending. Did Trump attempt to obstruct justice during the Russia investigation? What is the rationale behind the President's Saudi Arabia response in the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder? Have there been conflicts of interest between Trump's business empire and his political decisions? Are cabinet officials violating ethics rules and using their positions for their own benefit? Is the appointment of Matthew Whitaker to be acting attorney general legal?\n\nAnd these are just the tip of the iceberg. As Greg Sargent argues in his new book, \"An Uncivil War,\" Trump has stretched and strained the institutions of democracy in dangerous -- and perhaps previously unthinkable -- ways.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that the GOP has given investigation a bad name since the 1994 Republican Revolution. Congressional oversight has become a tool to score partisan political points and a mechanism to destroy the reputations, as well as legitimacy, of key political actors.\n\nAs a result, many pundits are now warning House Democrats not to dive too deep into investigations, lest they trigger a political backlash after the party's success in the midterm elections. They remember former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's drive to impeach President Bill Clinton, after Republicans were already consumed with investigations into other scandals, such as Whitewater, which backfired and devastated public support for the GOP rather than Clinton.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump sends finished written answers to Mueller", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Fum_0wTxVfI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller related to the investigation of possible collusion between Trump associates and Russians.\n\nThe responses from the President signify a major development in the Mueller probe following months of negotiations between the special counsel's office and Trump's legal team, and could be a sign of the end stages of the investigation.\n\nTrump told reporters before boarding Marine One to travel to Mar-a-Lago in Florida that he finished the written answers on Monday and provided them to his lawyers. \"The written answers are finished,\" Trump said. \"The written answers to the witch hunt that's been going on forever.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought Mueller would be fair, Trump said he hopes so.\n\n\"The President today answered written questions submitted by the special counsel's office,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement. \"The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry.

And Trump suggested in a recent interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" that those could be off the table.\n\n\"I think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished,\" Trump told Fox's Chris Wallace when asked if he would say no to an in-person interview or providing answers on obstruction questions.\n\nIf Trump's legal team rebuffs further inquiries from Mueller, it will be up to the special counsel to decide whether he has enough to finish writing his report or he needs an interview. Mueller could try to subpoena Trump for an interview, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker likely would need to sign off on that decision.\n\nThe big looming question over the agreement for Trump to provide the written answers related to the period during the campaign is whether that satisfies Mueller's questions about the transition and inauguration. Trump's legal team was provided a list of questions in the spring that included asking about efforts during the transition to establish a back channel to Russia and a 2017 meeting in the Seychelles involving Trump ally Erik Prince, a businessman and founder of the private security company formerly known as Blackwater."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump: Mueller probe decisions up to Whitaker", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/i3BScT56kIY/trump-whitaker-mueller-fox-news-sot-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump said \"it's going to be up to him\" when asked if he would accept any move by acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, in an interview on Fox News."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "EU leaders endorse Brexit deal", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/sfRh75DzLoo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Brussels, Belgium (CNN) All 27 remaining European Union leaders signed off Britain's Brexit agreement with mixed emotions at a special summit on Sunday -- but the deal's real test is yet to come.\n\nWhile EU leaders mourned a \"sad day\" in the bloc's decades-long history, UK Prime Minister Theresa May disagreed, saying \"I am full of optimism.\"\n\nLess than an hour after members gathered in Brussels, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that they had endorsed the \"Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU-UK relations.\"\n\nThe agreement is a small victory for May, who must now persuade lawmakers in the UK Parliament to vote for her deal.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker greet each other in Brussels on Sunday.\n\nGiven that opposition parties -- not to mention many lawmakers within May's Conservative party and the Northern Irish DUP, which supports her minority government -- have indicated they'll vote against it, the deal is far from sealed.\n\nShortly after European leaders endorsed the deal, DUP leader Arlene Foster reiterated that her party \"will not be able to support\" it, during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.\n\nIf UK lawmakers do approve the deal, which looks highly doubtful, it will then go to the European Parliament.\n\nBut if Westminster stops the deal in its tracks, then Brexit could go a number of ways -- including exiting the bloc without a deal at all, or, just possibly, a second referendum that could scrap Brexit altogether.\n\nIt would also cast serious doubt on May's future as prime minister, already under intense scrutiny from Brexiteers within her own party unhappy with what they say is a \"soft\" exit from European regulations.\n\nWhen asked by reporters Sunday if she would consider stepping down if the deal flounders in Parliament, May said \"this is not about me.\"\n\n\"My focus for the next few weeks is making this deal possible,\" she said, adding, \"if people think there's another negotiation to be done, that's not the case.\"\n\nJuncker also urged the UK Parliament to vote for the deal, set to happen before Christmas.

The Sentinelese, as they are known, have a decades-long history of repelling outsiders, a fact that is near certain to make the journey to find Chau a treacherous one.\n\nIndian authorities along with the fishermen who reported seeing Chau's body last week, went near the island on Friday and Saturday in an effort to figure out how to recover the body.\n\n\"We have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried,\" said Dependra Pathak, a top police official in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nPathak said the group spotted several tribe members carrying bows and arrows and walking around the area where the fishermen said they saw Chau's body being dragged and buried.\n\n\"The mission was done from a distance to avoid any potential conflict with the tribespeople as it's a sensitive zone,\" he said. \"We are discussing with anthropologists and psychologists about the nature of the Sentinelese.\"\n\nPathak said there are a lot of things to consider before they enter the island, including the psychology of its residents.\n\n\"There are legal requirements as well which we need to keep in mind while carrying out the operation. We are also studying the 2006 case where two local fishermen were killed. The bodies were recovered then,\" he said.\n\nThe Sentinelese: World's most isolated tribe\n\nThe Sentinelese have lived in complete isolation on the remote North Sentinel Island for tens of thousands of years. The island, which is part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, is roughly as large as Manhattan.\n\nIndia has protected the island for decades to prevent the Sentinelese from contracting modern illnesses and to keep outsiders alive.\n\nPeople are not allowed to go within five nautical miles of the island by Indian law and the Indian Navy patrols it day and night.\n\nAnd while its residents have no contact with the outside world, they aren't too far from other civilizations.\n\nThe island is only about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the territory's capital known to tourists for its stunning emerald beaches, history and water sports.\n\nAt least 15 Sentinelese could be living on the island, according to India's census estimates from 2011.\n\nHe returned to his boat twice before vanishing\n\nTraveling on a tourist visa, Chau arrived to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October with one mission: preach to the Sentinelese.\n\nIndian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26.\n\nHe had traveled to the remote island years ago and returned knowing that his mission was illegal and risky. Still, he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life. He hoped to eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey.\n\nJohn Allen Chau, right, was in Cape Town days before he traveled to North Sentinel Island.\n\nHe asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and also recruit others -- several fishermen and a water sports expert -- who could help him.\n\nHe carefully planned his expedition and used a 13-page long journal to write his strategy, the steps he would take to reach the island and, later, some of his memories.\n\nAfter he paid the fishermen around $350, police said, the group boarded \"a wooded boat fitted with motors\" and headed to the island on the night of November 15.\n\nThey stopped a little less than half a mile away and waited in the dark. At some point in the morning, Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said.\n\nHe returned later that day with arrow injuries, police said.\n\nBut that did not discourage him.\n\nHe returned to the island the following day. It's unclear what happened but \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe\" and he had no other option than to swim back to the boat.\n\nOn the third attempt of his mission, he didn't come back.\n\nThe fishermen said they later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around but police haven't been able to independently verify Chau's death. Authorities believe he was killed.\n\nAll seven locals who facilitated the trip have been arrested.\n\nHis diary reveals his last days\n\nIn excerpts from his journal, Chau described his time on the island and the challenges he faced. A tribesman shot at him with a bow and arrow, piercing a Bible he was carrying, he wrote in his diary, pages of which were shared by his mother with the Washington Post.\n\n\"I hollered, 'My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,'\" he wrote. Shortly after, a young member of the tribe shot at him, according to his account.\n\nIn pages left with the fishermen who facilitated his trip to the island, his musings are a clear indication of his desire to convert the tribe.\n\n\"Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?\" he wrote.\n\nHis notes indicate that he knew the trip was illegal, describing how the small fishing vessel transported him to the isolated island under cover of darkness, evading patrols.\n\nPlease do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed John Chau in a letter to his family\n\n\"God Himself was hiding us from the Coast Guard and many patrols,\" he wrote.\n\nBefore he left the boat for the last time, Chau wrote one final note to his family and gave it to the fishermen.\n\n\"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people,\" it said. \"God, I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed -- rather please live your lives in obedience to whatever He has called you to and I will see you again when you pass through the veil.\"\n\nHe loved Jesus\n\nRaised in Vancouver, Washington, Chau was first drawn to the outdoors after discovering a rcopy of \"Robinson Crusoe\" while in elementary school, he said in an article several years ago in The Outbound Collective, a website and app that helps people discover the outdoors.\n\nHe and his brother would paint their faces with wild blackberry juice and run around their backyard with bows and spears made from sticks, according to the article.\n\nChau graduated from Oral Roberts University, where he got involved with Covenant Journey, the Christian ministry that takes college students on immersion trips to Israel, according to Staver, who is the group's chairman.\n\nChau traveled to Israel with Covenant Journey, and to South Africa on missions with a group at Oral Roberts, Staver said.\n\n\"John loved people, and he loved Jesus. He was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people on North Sentinel island,\" Staver said in a press release. \"Ever since high school, John wanted to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with this indigenous people.\"\n\nIn the Outward Collective article, Chau spoke of his earlier adventures, including hiking Table Mountain in Washington state on Christmas break while in college.\n\nChau said going back to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was on the top of his adventure to-do list, the article said.\n\nHe's not the first one killed on the island\n\nChau is not the first person to fall victim to the Sentinelese after intruding on their island, which is illegal for outsiders to land on.\n\nIn 2006, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding North Sentinel Island after their boat drifted ashore, according to Survival International.\n\nAn image of a Sentinelese tribesman aiming a bow and arrow at a helicopter in 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nIn the wake of the ruinous 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, a member of the group was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nFirst contact was made by the British in the late 1800s, when, despite their attempts to hide, six individuals from the tribe were captured and taken to the main island of the Andaman Island archipelago. Two captured adults died of illness while the four children were returned -- perhaps also infected with illnesses that the islanders' immune systems were unequipped to deal with.\n\nAnthropological expeditions were made to tribal groups in the island chain in the 1980s and 1990s, and \"gift-dropping trips\" continued until the mid-90s, but now all contact has ceased.\n\nThe Indian government has adopted an \"'eyes-on and hands-off' policy to ensure that no poachers enter (North Sentinel Island),\" according to India's Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\nTribe encounters are usually violent\n\nThe Andaman Island tribe is one of the last remaining isolated groups in the world.\n\nJonathan Mazower of Survival International, which campaigns for the protection of isolated tribes, says there are around 100 such tribes around the world. Most are found in the Amazon rainforest but there are many in New Guinea as well as in forests and islands elsewhere.\n\nWhen contact does occur, it can prove fatal -- tribespeople frequently attack intruders, and can also fall victim to common diseases like the flu, for which they have no immunity. \"Often, they are very fearful of outsiders -- with very good reason,\" Mazower said.\n\n\"Sometimes they will have in their collective memory a massacre, a violent incident, or a disease or epidemic -- so very often, there are well-founded reasons for these tribes to not want to have anything to do\" with the outside world, Mazower told CNN.\n\nWhile the Sentinelese are protected by Indian laws which make it illegal to intrude on their island, most uncontacted people do not have the same fortune, their habitats instead being encroached upon by unwelcome outsiders.\n\n\"The most important challenge, by far, is to protect their land,\" Mazower said. \"That is the absolute essential. If their lands are protected, which is their right under international law, then there is actually no reason they should not continue to survive and thrive."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Family demands answers after police kill man mistaken for shooter at mall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/zc3PojV-PGs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump blasted police Sunday for the fatal shooting of a black man at an Alabama mall, a relative holding photos of the man collapsed, wailing.\n\nFamily members helped her up and consoled her.

The agency said it would have an update Sunday afternoon.\n\nWith signs reading \"Justice for EJ\" and \"Black Lives Matter,\" dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the mall Saturday, footage from CNN affiliate WVTM shows.\n\n\"No justice, no peace,\" they shouted. \"No racist police.\"\n\nThey called for the officer who shot Bradford to be arrested for murder.\n\nThe officer is on administrative leave during an investigation, police said. Hoover police also will conduct an internal investigation, Capt. Gregg Rector said.\n\n'He loved people, period'\n\nRelatives have demanded answers but say police haven't provided any. Bradford's uncle, Anthony Thomas, told reporters he would not stop fighting until he saw justice.\n\n\"My son was a loving -- very loving -- young man. He would give any of you the shirt off his back,\" his mother, April Pipkins, told reporters Sunday. \"He loved people, period. He was not a killer.\"\n\nBradford had no criminal record, Crump said. He was a caretaker for his father, who is battling cancer, worked full time and helped his mother financially. He had a concealed weapon permit for the gun he was carrying that day, the attorney said.\n\nEmantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. said on his Facebook page he was a US Army combat engineer. An Army spokesman told CNN he never completed advanced individual training and did not officially serve in the Army.\n\n\"EJ was a devoted son and brother, who dedicated his life to serving his country and always doing the right thing,\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"As we continue to grieve, rest assured that we are working diligently with our legal team to determine exactly what happened and why this police officer killed our son. We will never forget EJ, and ask for your continued prayers during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\n\"They killed him for no reason at all. He wasn't the shooter,\" his aunt, Catherine Jewell, told reporters . \"He was a great guy. He was very respectable ... They did him wrong.\"\n\nThough Bradford's Facebook page says he was a US Army engineer, he did not complete advanced individual training and did not serve, said Army spokesman Lt. Col. Manny Ortiz.

The Sentinelese, as they are known, have a decades-long history of repelling outsiders, a fact that is near certain to make the journey to find Chau a treacherous one.\n\nIndian authorities along with the fishermen who reported seeing Chau's body last week, went near the island on Friday and Saturday in an effort to figure out how to recover the body.\n\n\"We have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried,\" said Dependra Pathak, a top police official in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nPathak said the group spotted several tribe members carrying bows and arrows and walking around the area where the fishermen said they saw Chau's body being dragged and buried.\n\n\"The mission was done from a distance to avoid any potential conflict with the tribespeople as it's a sensitive zone,\" he said. \"We are discussing with anthropologists and psychologists about the nature of the Sentinelese.\"\n\nPathak said there are a lot of things to consider before they enter the island, including the psychology of its residents.\n\n\"There are legal requirements as well which we need to keep in mind while carrying out the operation. We are also studying the 2006 case where two local fishermen were killed. The bodies were recovered then,\" he said.\n\nThe Sentinelese: World's most isolated tribe\n\nThe Sentinelese have lived in complete isolation on the remote North Sentinel Island for tens of thousands of years. The island, which is part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, is roughly as large as Manhattan.\n\nIndia has protected the island for decades to prevent the Sentinelese from contracting modern illnesses and to keep outsiders alive.\n\nPeople are not allowed to go within five nautical miles of the island by Indian law and the Indian Navy patrols it day and night.\n\nAnd while its residents have no contact with the outside world, they aren't too far from other civilizations.\n\nThe island is only about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the territory's capital known to tourists for its stunning emerald beaches, history and water sports.\n\nAt least 15 Sentinelese could be living on the island, according to India's census estimates from 2011.\n\nHe returned to his boat twice before vanishing\n\nTraveling on a tourist visa, Chau arrived to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October with one mission: preach to the Sentinelese.\n\nIndian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26.\n\nHe had traveled to the remote island years ago and returned knowing that his mission was illegal and risky. Still, he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life. He hoped to eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey.\n\nJohn Allen Chau, right, was in Cape Town days before he traveled to North Sentinel Island.\n\nHe asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and also recruit others -- several fishermen and a water sports expert -- who could help him.\n\nHe carefully planned his expedition and used a 13-page long journal to write his strategy, the steps he would take to reach the island and, later, some of his memories.\n\nAfter he paid the fishermen around $350, police said, the group boarded \"a wooded boat fitted with motors\" and headed to the island on the night of November 15.\n\nThey stopped a little less than half a mile away and waited in the dark. At some point in the morning, Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said.\n\nHe returned later that day with arrow injuries, police said.\n\nBut that did not discourage him.\n\nHe returned to the island the following day. It's unclear what happened but \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe\" and he had no other option than to swim back to the boat.\n\nOn the third attempt of his mission, he didn't come back.\n\nThe fishermen said they later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around but police haven't been able to independently verify Chau's death. Authorities believe he was killed.\n\nAll seven locals who facilitated the trip have been arrested.\n\nHis diary reveals his last days\n\nIn excerpts from his journal, Chau described his time on the island and the challenges he faced. A tribesman shot at him with a bow and arrow, piercing a Bible he was carrying, he wrote in his diary, pages of which were shared by his mother with the Washington Post.\n\n\"I hollered, 'My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,'\" he wrote. Shortly after, a young member of the tribe shot at him, according to his account.\n\nIn pages left with the fishermen who facilitated his trip to the island, his musings are a clear indication of his desire to convert the tribe.\n\n\"Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?\" he wrote.\n\nHis notes indicate that he knew the trip was illegal, describing how the small fishing vessel transported him to the isolated island under cover of darkness, evading patrols.\n\nPlease do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed John Chau in a letter to his family\n\n\"God Himself was hiding us from the Coast Guard and many patrols,\" he wrote.\n\nBefore he left the boat for the last time, Chau wrote one final note to his family and gave it to the fishermen.\n\n\"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people,\" it said. \"God, I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed -- rather please live your lives in obedience to whatever He has called you to and I will see you again when you pass through the veil.\"\n\nHe loved Jesus\n\nRaised in Vancouver, Washington, Chau was first drawn to the outdoors after discovering a rcopy of \"Robinson Crusoe\" while in elementary school, he said in an article several years ago in The Outbound Collective, a website and app that helps people discover the outdoors.\n\nHe and his brother would paint their faces with wild blackberry juice and run around their backyard with bows and spears made from sticks, according to the article.\n\nChau graduated from Oral Roberts University, where he got involved with Covenant Journey, the Christian ministry that takes college students on immersion trips to Israel, according to Staver, who is the group's chairman.\n\nChau traveled to Israel with Covenant Journey, and to South Africa on missions with a group at Oral Roberts, Staver said.\n\n\"John loved people, and he loved Jesus. He was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people on North Sentinel island,\" Staver said in a press release. \"Ever since high school, John wanted to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with this indigenous people.\"\n\nIn the Outward Collective article, Chau spoke of his earlier adventures, including hiking Table Mountain in Washington state on Christmas break while in college.\n\nChau said going back to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was on the top of his adventure to-do list, the article said.\n\nHe's not the first one killed on the island\n\nChau is not the first person to fall victim to the Sentinelese after intruding on their island, which is illegal for outsiders to land on.\n\nIn 2006, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding North Sentinel Island after their boat drifted ashore, according to Survival International.\n\nAn image of a Sentinelese tribesman aiming a bow and arrow at a helicopter in 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nIn the wake of the ruinous 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, a member of the group was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nFirst contact was made by the British in the late 1800s, when, despite their attempts to hide, six individuals from the tribe were captured and taken to the main island of the Andaman Island archipelago. Two captured adults died of illness while the four children were returned -- perhaps also infected with illnesses that the islanders' immune systems were unequipped to deal with.\n\nAnthropological expeditions were made to tribal groups in the island chain in the 1980s and 1990s, and \"gift-dropping trips\" continued until the mid-90s, but now all contact has ceased.\n\nThe Indian government has adopted an \"'eyes-on and hands-off' policy to ensure that no poachers enter (North Sentinel Island),\" according to India's Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\nTribe encounters are usually violent\n\nThe Andaman Island tribe is one of the last remaining isolated groups in the world.\n\nJonathan Mazower of Survival International, which campaigns for the protection of isolated tribes, says there are around 100 such tribes around the world. Most are found in the Amazon rainforest but there are many in New Guinea as well as in forests and islands elsewhere.\n\nWhen contact does occur, it can prove fatal -- tribespeople frequently attack intruders, and can also fall victim to common diseases like the flu, for which they have no immunity. \"Often, they are very fearful of outsiders -- with very good reason,\" Mazower said.\n\n\"Sometimes they will have in their collective memory a massacre, a violent incident, or a disease or epidemic -- so very often, there are well-founded reasons for these tribes to not want to have anything to do\" with the outside world, Mazower told CNN.\n\nWhile the Sentinelese are protected by Indian laws which make it illegal to intrude on their island, most uncontacted people do not have the same fortune, their habitats instead being encroached upon by unwelcome outsiders.\n\n\"The most important challenge, by far, is to protect their land,\" Mazower said. \"That is the absolute essential. If their lands are protected, which is their right under international law, then there is actually no reason they should not continue to survive and thrive."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "More than 100 sea turtles found dead off Cape Cod", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/JC93IGH4LD8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A total of 173 sea turtles died off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, this week because of the extreme cold, according to Mass Audubon Director Bob Prescott.\n\nPrescott said 227 cold-stunned turtles were recovered from the Gulf of Maine since Wednesday, but only 54 lived.

Cindy Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier's effort to \"defend his homeland\" and pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War.\n\nHyde-Smith, a Republican, faces Mike Espy, a Democratic former congressman and agriculture secretary, in Tuesday's runoff in Mississippi -- the final Senate race to be decided in 2018. The measure , which was unearthed by CNN's KFile during a review of Hyde-Smith's legislative history, is the latest in a series of issues that have surfaced during her campaign, many of which have evoked Mississippi's dark history of racism and slavery.\n\nAs a state senator in 2007, Hyde-Smith cosponsored a resolution that honored then-92-year-old Effie Lucille Nicholson Pharr, calling her \"the last known living 'Real Daughter' of the Confederacy living in Mississippi.\" Pharr's father had been a Confederate soldier in Robert E. Lee's army in the Civil War.\n\nThe resolution refers to the Civil War as \"The War Between the States.\" It says her father \"fought to defend his homeland and contributed to the rebuilding of the country.\" It says that with \"great pride,\" Mississippi lawmakers \"join the Sons of Confederate Veterans\" to honor Pharr.\n\nThe measure \"rests on an odd combination of perpetuating both the Confederate legacy and the idea that this was not really in conflict with being a good citizen of the nation,\" said Nina Silber, the president of the Society of Civil War Historians and a Boston University history professor.\n\n\"I also think it's curious that this resolution -- which ostensibly is about honoring the 'daughter' -- really seems to be an excuse to glorify the Confederate cause,\" Silber said.\n\nThe Sons of Confederate Veterans, according to the group's website , is a \"historical, patriotic, and non-political organization dedicated to insuring that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved.\" The group says on its website that \"The preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the South's decision to fight the Second American Revolution.\"\n\nThe concurrent resolution was approved by Mississippi's House and Senate. Hyde-Smith served as a state senator from 2000 to 2012. She was a Democrat before switching parties in 2010, citing her conservative beliefs. Hyde-Smith's campaign did not respond Saturday to a request for comment on the resolution.\n\nNews of the 2007 measure comes amid increased scrutiny of Hyde-Smith's past after a series of recordings surfaced that featured her making comments about attending a \"public hanging\" and suppressing the votes of students in the state.\n\nHyde-Smith was recorded telling supporters in Tupelo earlier this month that she'd be \"on the front row\" if one of her supporters there \"invited me to a public hanging\" -- a phrase her campaign called an \"exaggerated expression of regard.\" The same progressive blogger who published the video later published one in which she told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \"a great thing.\" Her campaign said it was a joke.\n\nOn Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate schools by sending their children to schools without black students. Hyde-Smith's daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press.\n\nHyde-Smith campaign spokeswoman Melissa Scallan, when asked to comment on the report, attacked the \"liberal media,\" saying in a statement, \"They have stooped to a new low, attacking her entire family and trying to destroy her personally instead of focusing on the clear differences on the issues between Cindy Hyde-Smith and her far-left opponent.\"\n\nThe 2007 resolution wasn't the only legislation Hyde-Smith backed that would elevate Mississippi's Confederate history. The Washington Post reported that in 2001, Hyde-Smith introduced a bill as a state senator to rename a stretch of highway to what it had been called in the 1930s: the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, after the president of the Confederacy.\n\nAnd in photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Davis. The caption on the post read, \"Mississippi history at its best!\"\n\nMississippi still displays the Confederate battle flag within its state flag. But more critical attention has been paid toward Confederate monuments, symbols and icons in recent years, particularly after the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting and white supremacists' march in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy debated Tuesday night. But otherwise, Hyde-Smith's campaign has kept her mostly out of public eye and away from the press -- eschewing the usual event-after-event sprint to Election Day -- as controversy over racially insensitive remarks she'd made earlier this month swirled.\n\nSeveral companies that donated to Hyde-Smith's campaign, including Walmart, have publicly withdrawn their support for the senator over the \"public hanging\" comment.\n\nIn her debate with Espy, Hyde-Smith said she would \"certainly apologize\" to anyone who was offended by her remark about attending a \"public hanging.\" But she quickly pivoted into attack mode.\n\n\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" she said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The race to control the Senate in 2020 has already started", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/DxL1eUfPDHU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Massive fundraising in Maine. A countdown clock in Alabama. Calls and texts encouraging potential challengers in Colorado. Just a few weeks after 2018's Election Day, the signs are clear: the 2020 Senate campaigns are already underway.\n\nDemocrats start 2020 in a solid position, though they remain in the minority in the upper chamber of Congress. Of the 12 Democratic seats up for re-election, only two are from states President Donald Trump won in 2016 -- Alabama's Doug Jones and Michigan's Gary Peters. Republicans have more seats to defend , with 22 GOP seats on the line.\n\n\"The map looks good for the Democrats \u2014 I'll tell you that,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the new chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told CNN.\n\nDemocrats will have opportunities to flip seats and potentially win back the majority in 2020. But the party could face difficult races against Republican incumbents in purple states like Maine and Colorado. Democrats will also have to defend the most vulnerable seat currently on the map in the deep red state of Alabama.\n\nRepublicans optimistic in Alabama\n\nJones hopes that his campaign playbook of running on health care, against tariffs and carefully explaining his vote against Judge Brett Kavanaugh will allow him to save his seat.\n\nBut Republicans are confident they can take it back, presuming they put up a significantly stronger candidate than Jones' last opponent, Roy Moore, who lost by only a point and a half despite facing accusations of sexual assault, which he denied. Even before the 2018 midterms were over, the Alabama Republican Party was counting down the days on its website until Jones \"is unseated\" in the 2020 contest.\n\nOne question looming over the race is whether Jeff Sessions, who formerly held the Senate seat, decides to run after President Donald Trump fired him as attorney general. If Sessions shows signs of entering the race, that would change the political calculus for other Republicans considering a bid.\n\nSo far, at least one potential GOP challenger is publicly weighing the possibility of a run against Jones: Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama.\n\nSeth Morrow, a spokesman for the congressman, told CNN that Byrne has \"made clear he is interested in running,\" but isn't expecting to reach a final decision \"until next spring at the earliest.\"\n\nSome in the state seem to think Byrne's mind is already made up. \"He's running,\" Jonathan Gray, an Alabama Republican strategist, said in an interview. \"Has Bradley announced? Not publicly. But the conversations are happening.\"\n\nSupporters have encouraged Rep. Mo Brooks to run for Senate again after he ran in the 2017 Republican primary, but the congressman has told Byrne that at this time it is \"unlikely\" he will run in 2020, an Alabama Republican close to congressman Brooks told CNN.\n\nWhen asked if he would run again, Brooks told CNN, \"Bradley Byrne looks like he's running \u2014 talk to him.\"\n\nDemocrats look for pickups\n\nWith so many seats to defend, Republicans could defeat Jones and still lose the Senate. But it would be a tough slog for Democrats, who would then need to gain even more seats to win a majority, perhaps by winning the open seat left by the retiring Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl or by defeating incumbent senators like Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nFor now, they're jockeying for the opportunity. In North Carolina, \"the name people talk about most\" is state Sen. Jeff Jackson, according to Gary Pearce, a longtime strategist in the state, who added that others, including a woman or someone of color, may also emerge.\n\nIn Arizona, Grant Woods, the former state Attorney General and former chief of staff to the late Sen. John McCain, former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, Rep. Ruben Gallego and Greg Stanton, the former Phoenix mayor who was elected to the House in the 2018 midterms, are on the list of potential candidates Democratic strategists have mentioned.\n\nIn Colorado, Crisanta Duran, the Democratic House speaker of the state's House of Representatives and Mike Johnston, a former state senator who ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2018, both told CNN they are considering a 2020 Senate run.\n\n\"I have had a great number of folks reach out to me and ask me if I would consider running,\" Johnston said. \"There has been a big increase in phone calls and text messages since election night.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaign draws attention to Maine\n\nIn Maine, Democrats are hoping to sweep out of office Collins, who will be the only Republican in New England's 33-person congressional delegation in the next Congress. In the past year, she has infuriated both liberals and conservatives alike with her votes to send Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and save the Affordable Care Act from repeal.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kavanaugh vote, one crowdfunding campaign has raised nearly $4 million to support a future challenger to Collins.\n\n\"I think that has piqued a lot of people's interest,\" Toby McGrath, a political strategist in Maine who ran both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in the state, said of the crowdfunding efforts. \"I think a lot of people will be thinking about running.\"\n\nEven Democrats in the state privately acknowledge, however, that Collins won't be easy to defeat. The Maine Republican has successfully won election to the Senate four times already and has frequently won by wide margins. Jared Golden, a Democrat who just flipped a Republican seat in rural Maine, touted in his advertisements that he worked as an aide to Collins.\n\n\"Overall, her votes have reflected pretty squarely what her constituency is looking for,\" said Lance Dutson, a strategist who worked on previous Collins campaigns. \"And when it comes down to making these tough, 50-50 calls, I think she does what she thinks is right and then moves forward from it.\"\n\nBut should Collins decide to run for re-election, she will likely face a tough environment with national interest in her race.\n\nA number of names have been floated as potential Democratic challengers to Collins.\n\nSara Gideon, the Democratic speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, is \"seriously considering\" running, according to spokeswoman Mary-Erin Casale.\n\nOther names that have been talked about as potential challengers are Rep. Chellie Pingree, who unsuccessfully challenged Collins in a 2002 Senate race, and Susan Rice, who served as national security adviser in the Obama administration and fueled speculation that she might enter the race after she tweeted \"me\" last month in response to a tweet asking who would run for the Senate seat. Rice later said that she was \"not making any announcements,\" but she has continued to weigh in on Twitter with commentary on Collins.\n\nOther senators to keep an eye on\n\nWhile they'd likely not change control of the Senate, there are a number of other senators whose loss would change the makeup of the chamber. First-term senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, for example, is considering a run for governor.\n\n\"I think Gov. (John Bel) Edwards is taking our state in the wrong direction, and I think based on the extensive polling that I've done and I've seen there are only two people who can beat him: one is Scalise and one is me,\" Kennedy told CNN, referring to House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, who has rejected any interest in running for governor.\n\n\"I haven't made a decision,\" Kennedy added. \"I've enjoyed being in the Senate.\"\n\nThere are also rumors of retirements surrounding some members who have roamed the halls of the Capitol for decades.\n\nThe Cook Political Report notes that seven Republicans will be 70 or older at the time of the 2020 elections: Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, Sen. Michael Enzi of Wyoming, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Sen. James Risch of Idaho, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma.\n\nUnlike McConnell, who has already made moves to run for reelection, two of the oldest senators \u2014 Roberts and Inhofe \u2014 have not said whether they'd go for another six-year term.\n\n\"The first order of business\" for Roberts is \"finishing the farm bill\" that is \"critical to our (agriculture) economy, according to spokeswoman Sarah Little. \"With the ink on the 2018 election cycle barely dry, Senator Roberts would like to give Kansans a breather before the campaigning starts all over again.\"\n\nYet at least one member of Congress would consider running if Roberts, a fourth-generation Kansan, decided to retire after serving in the House and Senate for nearly 40 years. In interviews, Kansas political strategists note that Rep. Roger Marshall would be well-positioned to take over from Roberts should he decide to retire. Former Sen. Bob Dole, as well as current senators Roberts and Jerry Moran, all represented the massive first congressional district that Marshall now serves in the House.\n\nMarshall, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has delivered more than 5,000 babies, told CNN that he and his wife \"would talk seriously about\" running if Roberts, 82, retired. Marshall added that he would \"never, ever\" run against the senator, that he doesn't see Roberts retiring in the \"near future,\" that Roberts is doing a \"great job\" especially with the Farm Bill and that he considers the senator a mentor.\n\n\"I'll cross that bridge when we get to it,\" said Marshall. \"I think Senator Roberts is not going anywhere. I just can't emphasize enough that we're fully supportive of him.\"\n\nAs for Inhofe, 84, he told CNN he's \"not necessarily\" going to run again.\n\n\"Last time I ran, all they could say is 'Inhofe you're too old to be in the United States Senate,'\" said Inhofe. \"My response was, when I'm told to fly airplanes upside down, then I'm too old to fly in the United States Senate.\"\n\nInhofe noted that he still flies upside down.\n\n\"That's right \u2014 I qualify,\" he said. \"I have not made any plans to leave.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Schiff: 'We are going to bring Whitaker before the Congress'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/K4RzofD0XpE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) California Democratic Rep.

Americans are far less likely to approve of the President on other issues such as foreign policy and immigration.\n\nThat Trump cannot get his overall approval rating up, however, despite what Americans see as a strong economy, is not a great sign for the President heading into his reelection campaign.\n\nIndeed, the difference between Trump's net economic approval rating and net overall approval rating is astonishingly high when put in a historical context. I looked up every single president's overall and economic net approval ratings right around each midterm since 1978.\n\nNo other president has done this much worse overall than his economic ratings would suggest. On average, their overall net approval rating has actually run 17 points better than their economic net approval rating. Trump is running 27 points worse. The only president to come close to Trump's negative differential was Bill Clinton in 1998. That was when Clinton was getting impeached.\n\nTrump is not the first president to have a bad midterm. A number who had a bad first term went on to win reelection two years later.\n\nMany of those prior presidents, however, were seen as having mismanaged the economy heading to the midterm, according to CBS News polls dating back to the late 1970s (when CBS News first asked the question).\n\nThat was true for Ronald Reagan in 1982 (net economic approval rating of -3 points), Clinton in 1994 (net economic approval rating of -19 points) and Barack Obama in 2010 (net economic approval rating -13 points).\n\nBy the next presidential election, all of these presidents saw their net economic approval rating climb 10 points or more in the CBS News poll. With that, the overall approval rating of all of these presidents went up by double-digits as well.\n\nTrump is in a very different situation. People believe he is doing well on the economy, but that isn't translating to a stronger overall approval rating.\n\nCould Trump turn it around in time for 2020? Of course. Two years is an eternity in politics. For Trump to be a favorite for reelection, he probably needs one of three things to happen.\n\nOption one is for Trump to not do anything and hope his overall approval rating comes into closer alignment with his economic approval rating on its own. Now the past is often not prologue when it comes to electoral politics (see the fact that Trump became president). That said, Trump's overall approval rating has continually run behind his economic approval rating. This is not some new phenomenon.\n\nOption two is that the economy gets even better, so that even if his overall approval rating lags his economic approval rating, both can rise to the point where his overall approval rating makes him a favorite for reelection. This is possible, but remember the economy is already really strong. The unemployment rate is 3.7% . It has dipped only 0.4 points over the last year.\n\nOption three is that Trump acts more like a conventional president to allow voters' economic views to more closely match their overall views of Trump. Trump's tweets, attacks on the media and improvisational style may be fodder for his base, but they don't seem to be working on the electorate at-large. A Monmouth University poll earlier this year found that the vast majority of Americans said Trump ran a less conventional administration than normal, and by a 21-point margin, they said that was a bad thing.\n\nOf these options, only the third one is really in Trump's immediate control. The question is how does option three actually happen? Trump's been president for nearly two years now, and at no point has he really shown any sign that he's willing to get out of his own way."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Alan Dershowitz says Mueller report will be 'devastating' to Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/AAkMWTHtqCA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz, a frequent defender of President Donald Trump, said Sunday the forthcoming report on Russian interference in the 2016 election from special counsel Robert Mueller will be \"devastating\" politically to the President.\n\n\"I think the report is going to be devastating to the President,\" Dershowitz, a fomer Harvard law professor, said on \" ABC This Week. \" \"And I know that the President's team is already working on a response to the report.\"\n\n\"At some point when the report's made public -- and that's a very hard question considering the new attorney general who has the authority to decide when and under what circumstance to make it public -- it will be made public probably with a response alongside,\" he added, referencing Matthew Whitaker, the new acting attorney general who replaced the fired Jeff Sessions after the November midterm election.\n\nMueller was appointed to lead the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election after Trump fired then FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 while he was leading the initial investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nTrump has repeatedly derided Mueller's investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and insisted there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Russia.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Climate change will have dire consequences for US, federal report concludes", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/CkL7MfRXrZE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A new US government report delivers a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts, saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century.\n\nThe federally mandated study was supposed to come out in December but was released by the Trump administration on Friday, at a time when many Americans are on a long holiday weekend, distracted by family and shopping.\n\n\"The global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced, and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities,\" Easterling said.\n\nComing from the US Global Change Research Program , a team of 13 federal agencies, the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government.\n\nIt's the second of two volumes. The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \"no convincing alternative explanation\" for the changing climate other than \"human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe report's findings run counter to President Donald Trump's consistent message that climate change is a hoax.\n\nBut the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear: Climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week; it's demonstrated by long-term trends. Humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history . Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWithout significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says.\n\nThe expense\n\nThe costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat.\n\nFarmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield.\n\nHeat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years -- having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010.\n\nRed tides, or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent. When it comes to shellfish there will be a $230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification, which is already killing off shellfish and corals.Red tides,or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent.\n\nImpacts on our health\n\nHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090.\n\nWest Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. There will be more mosquito- and tickborne diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures.\n\nExpect asthma and allergies to be worse due to climate change\n\nParticularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death. No one's health is immune from climate change, the report concludes. People will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases.Particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death.\n\nHeat and flooding\n\nWildfire seasons -- already longer and more destructive than before -- could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050.\n\nDependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures.\n\nAlong the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges.\n\nEnergy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said.\n\nThe number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days.\n\nSea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater.\n\nBy midcentury, it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, \"possibly significantly.\"\n\nWhat can be done\n\nThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country.\n\nBut the The Defense Department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security.But the Trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the Paris climate accord, aimed at lowering global temperatures, claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the US economy.\n\nA report from the UN in October urged all governments to take \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" to avoid disaster from climate change. That report predicted that the Earth will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. It also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nTime for action\n\nReactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community.\n\n\"If we're going to run this country like a business, it's time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost,\" said Robert Bullard, an environmental scientist at Texas Southern University.\n\n\"In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered, but believed and acted upon.\"\n\nScientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Dimming the sun: The answer to global warming?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Vh-333qhojg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Scientists are proposing an ingenious but as-yet-unproven way to tackle climate change: spraying sun-dimming chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe research by scientists at Harvard and Yale universities, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters , proposes using a technique known as stratospheric aerosol injection, which they say could cut the rate of global warming in half.\n\nThe technique would involve spraying large amounts of sulfate particles into the Earth's lower stratosphere at altitudes as high as 12 miles.

Previously there were no official statistics on how many people in the country were injecting drugs. A 2010 study of six states in Nigeria provided the only data for West Africa as a region.\n\nProduce grown in the garden by patients goes to the center's canteen.\n\n'Harm reduction' through free needles\n\nSenegal's government reacted with a \"harm reduction\" program when the survey was released. Back then 18,614 free needles and 17,564 condoms were handed out to addicts over a two-year period.\n\nBy December 2014, the government opened CEPIAD, offering methadone, condoms and clean needles with money from its AIDS prevention budget and training from UNODC and various international partners, including from the US and France.\n\n\"When I came in 2015,\" says Mbodj, \"it allowed me to slow my life down a little bit and have time for myself to think about things.\"\n\nLater that year and with money from the country's National AIDS Council -- CLNS -- Mbodj was able to launch a community group for addicts, Sant\u00e9 Espoir Vie (SEV), which translates as \"health, hope, life.\"\n\nThe nonprofit operates independently of CEPIAD but a few members, including Mbodj, are paid mediators recruiting new patients for the clinic.\n\nThese mediators network the city's high drug-use areas every day to connect with addicts. There are 12 mediators that go out in teams of two.\n\n\"When we go into these drug hotspots people are very comfortable with us because we used to be users. We know how to approach them,\" says Mbodj.\n\nNurse Mamadou Ka cares for a new patient who is in observation in CEPIAD.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help'\n\n\"If they miss a treatment we go to their homes.

In 2013, she was jailed for 15 days for begging in public.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help. All I was thinking about was just getting money and smoking.\"\n\nShe was at risk because of the unprotected sex and the violence that came with a drug-fueled lifestyle.\n\n\"At night sometimes thugs would follow us and steal our money, they would threaten us with knives and call us druggies,\" she says.\n\nIn 2015, she became very ill. When her sister took her to the hospital she was referred to CEPIAD for treatment and was diagnosed as HIV positive. Initially when she started treatment with counseling and drug substitution she relapsed and would still use cocaine.\n\n\"I made an agreement with the doctor that if I get married I am going to completely stop,\" she says. \"I've been married one year and eight months. I met someone here at the center. He is on methadone treatment but he's sober.\"\n\nFormer addict Esther B\u00e2, 50, takes her daily dose of methadone.

Then she met outreach workers from CEPIAD who offered her an alternative.\n\n\"I have been coming every day for two-and-a-half years.\"\n\nComprehensive treatment\n\nAt CEPIAD, psychologists and doctors provide counseling, HIV services, skills workshops and help with reintegrating into family networks.\n\nPeer support workers who are themselves former drug users also offer help along the journey to a drug-free life.\n\n\"All of those things are a good part of a comprehensive approach to treatment,\" says Robin Clark, a professor in the Departments of Family Medicine and Community Health and Quantitative Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts. He focuses on substance abuse and primary care.\n\nAs well as arts therapy, counseling is available to get addicts back into work.\n\nIt is crucial for such clinics to move beyond medication, he says of the use of methadone.\n\n\"There are a lot of psychosocial support just around daily living that really good effective centers try to offer to help people re-enter normal life after they have been unemployed, many people have been in prison,\" says Clark.\n\nApart from Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius are among the only eight countries in Africa offering 'harm reduction' approaches due to lack of funding and preference for faith-based and traditional healers.\n\n\"There are still challenges,\" admits Mbayang Fall Bousso, CEPIAD's health coordinator, who calls herself the organization's temple guardian.\n\n\"It's still only in Dakar and inside a hospital so not many people know it exists.\"\n\nThose making the daily commute face logistical challenges and she wants the clinic to run nationally.\n\n\"This way we can be able to reach out to those who are still not able or willing to come,\" says Bousso. \"To reduce the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B, TB and of course to reduce the amount of users.\"\n\nSince CEPIAD opened, more than 700 addicts have sought reprieve here. Now, outreach teams are targeting M'bour, about 80 kilometers south of Dakar.\n\n\"It's a beach town. It's a very touristy town too with a lot of cocaine and heroin.

We hope to have more information by Monday isolating the growing region.\"\n\nGottlieb said the key is to get the current stock off the market and restock with new produce. Romaine lettuce will be harvested soon in Florida, Arizona and other regions.\n\nNo one distributor or source has been identified, so the FDA is warning consumers to avoid all types and brands of romaine lettuce.

One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC.

The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella illness usually begin 12 to 72 hours after consuming something tainted with the organism and last about four to seven days. They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Romaine' calm: Funny and meaningful memes to 'lettuce' get through this recall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/zR3r1PvT6wg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Spinach.

A 90-day follow up is not enough to learn much about the pacemaker.\"\n\nWhat does the industry say?\n\nMedTech Europe, the body the represents the medical devices industry, said: \"Millions of people have safely benefited from medical devices and can now live healthier, more productive and more independent lives.\n\n\"Life is unimaginable today without the hundreds of thousands of medical devices in our hospitals and in our homes.\"\n\nAnd it defended the system of notified bodies which were \"selected for the expertise, impartiality, transparency and independence of their staff\".\n\nAbbott, which manufactured Nanostim, says that many patients have been helped by leadless pacemakers and many more will benefit from this technology in the future.\n\nIt said: \"In accordance with the European CE Mark approval process, the Nanostim leadless pacing system was approved based on strong performance and safety data.\n\n\"In addition, upon CE Mark approval Nanostim was further assessed through a European post market clinical follow-up study.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nThe UK's Royal College of Surgeons has called for \"drastic regulatory changes\".\n\nProf Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: \"All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term.\"\n\nBut when the European Union suggested tightening the rules, the industry ran a campaign called \"Don't lose the 3\".\n\nIt referred to the fact that manufacturers can get new products to patients three years quicker in Europe then they can in the United States.\n\nNew medical device regulation will come into force in Europe in 2020, but campaigners say the new rules do not go far enough.\n\nGerman MEP Dagmar Roth Behrendt told Panorama that an intensive lobbying campaign by the industry undermined the proposed reforms.\n\n\"It's a success for them and a failure for the European parliament and for European patients, I have no doubt about it.\n\n\"It is like an open wound for me, that we could not do more for European patients and for the safety of European patients hurts.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Las Vegas shootings: British soldier awarded for bravery", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-46334900", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:33", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright MoD Image caption Ross Woodward abandoned a meal when he heard gunfire and went to help the injured\n\nA British soldier who rushed to the aid of people injured in the Las Vegas massacre has been recognised by the Queen for his bravery.\n\nAlmost 500 people were hurt and 58 killed when a gunman opened fire on festival-goers at the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 1 October last year.\n\nTrooper Ross Woodward was off duty when he helped treat people with gunshot wounds and guided others to safety.\n\nHe said receiving the honour came as a \"total surprise\".\n\nThe 24-year-old from Beeston, Nottinghamshire had been enjoying a trip to the city with other soldiers after a desert training exercise in Nevada.\n\nThe group had been in the Tropicana hotel opposite and abandoned their meal when they heard gunfire.\n\n'People needed me'\n\n\"Anyone in the military would have done the same,\" Trooper Woodward said.\n\n\"To me it just felt like the right thing to do, because people were there and needed my help.

His mother also made her way there, but arrived a short time after he walked out.\n\nLessons learned\n\nIn the report, the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) examines cases like Joshua's to see what wider lessons can be learned from them and make recommendations for improving health services.\n\nThe HSIB found the care that people get varies according to where they live in England.\n\nIt points to research which suggests that nearly two-thirds of people arriving at A&E do not receive the mental health care they need.\n\nImage caption Jacob Knox-Hooke (r) says his brother Joshua should have had better care in A&E\n\nJoshua's inquest heard that despite him telling the triage nurse who assessed him that he was feeling suicidal, he was not referred to the psychiatric liaison team.\n\nHe should also have been kept within sight of staff at all times, but was not. The coroner said there was evidence that it was common for patients to leave the emergency department before a psychiatric assessment.\n\n\"People's lives are in the balance.

Eventually the pair found financing in the form of a government start-up loan of \u00a325,000.\n\nThey knew the crucial part of the product was its functionality. Judith looked into cutting-edge, high-absorbency fabrics herself, researching new developments in micro-fibres and even gaining inspiration from other industries such as car manufacturing.\n\n\"I stuttered home with lots of pieces of paper and an eyedropper and I dropped water on things,\" she says. \"I tested how much they went through and then I put things on blotting paper to see how much was going through there, and then how long they took to dry in the air.\"\n\nThey pinned the samples to pants, testing how they worked and how they performed when washed several times.\n\nThe duo had aimed to produce the knickers in the UK but costs drove them to China to make the products accessible for everyday consumers.\n\nJudith believes one of the reasons the incontinence market has been relatively untapped so far is because the subject remains somewhat stigmatised.\n\n\"To actually be found with pads in your handbag I think for most women would be just excruciatingly embarrassing,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha has spoken out about her experience\n\nAnne says companies like Giggle Knickers have been accused by some of \"preying on women's insecurities\" to make them buy products, instead of going to seek help or trying pelvic floor exercises, but she disagrees.\n\n\"We're not trying to say, 'Oh, put up with this and buy our product.'\n\n\"We're saying, 'No, you absolutely should go and see your GP.\n\n\"But in the meantime, you may need something that is a little less embarrassing, a little more environmentally friendly than buying pads.\"\n\nIn recent years a number of celebrities, including actress Kate Winslet and television presenter Nadia Sawalha, have come out and spoken about their incontinence - something Anne hopes will help break the taboo.\n\n\"There are lots of people out there, you know, physiotherapists and lots of groups now on Twitter and Instagram, where they're trying to get people to talk about it,\" she says.\n\n\"It happens to men as well, it isn't just women and rather than being ashamed and embarrassed about it, we should talk about it.\"\n\nWhat is 100 Women?\n\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories.\n\nIt's been a momentous year for women's rights around the globe, so in 2018 BBC 100 Women will reflect the trailblazing women who are using passion, indignation and anger to spark real change in the world around them."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "InSight Diary: The silence of space", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46332684", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption The InSight probe is set to touch down on the surface of Mars on Monday\n\nProf Tom Pike from Imperial College London is part of the science team on the US-led InSight mission to Mars. His group has supplied tiny seismometers that will enable the Nasa lander to detect \"Marsquakes\", which should reveal the internal structure of the Red Planet. Here, Prof Pike tells us what happened when his team switched on its sensor system during InSight's 6-month cruise to Mars.\n\nInSight is now just two days from Mars, closing in at more than 6,000mph. But it's not breaking a sweat.\n\nAfter May's launch hurled it towards Mars, InSight has been quietly following an orbit around the Sun, an orbit selected to catch up with Mars on Monday evening (UK time).\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Almost there: InSight launched from Earth on 5 May. It lands on Monday\n\nOn board, we have our silicon microseismometers, designed to pick up the faintest seismic activity once we land on Mars.\n\nOur spacecraft should be one of the quietest objects in the entire Solar System, a perfect zero gravity environment.\n\nWe always wanted to turn on our microseismometers during our cruise to Mars for what should be the best possible test of their sensitivity. That's difficult to do on Earth.\n\nEven when we took our microseismometers to one of the quietest places in Europe, deep in a mine under the Black Forest Mountains in Germany, the strongest signal came from the sea, hundreds of miles away. That signal was much larger than we're likely to see from any Marsquakes.\n\nDid we survive launch?\n\nSo, on our way we've decided to turn on our microseismometers for a few hours. It's not obvious what we will hear - nobody has measured the vibrations of an interplanetary spacecraft before with this sensitivity. We hope it's not the creaks and groans of the spacecraft itself, as it should have settled down after the launch.\n\nThere will be the occasional ping from interplanetary dust hitting the spacecraft, but we've calculated the chance of that happening while we're turned on is remote.\n\nImage copyright Imperial College/T.Pike Image caption One of the microseismometer sensors, carved from a single piece of silicon 25mm square\n\nThere's not been a sensor quite like ours sent into space before - the silicon mass and spring are designed to move freely backwards and forwards during launch and would have been bumped repeatedly between our solder stops.\n\nOf course, we tested this, but I'm now wondering if it was such a good idea to be the first to try something this new.\n\nWe've three sensors, one to measure the vertical seismic vibrations on Mars, SP1, and two to measure in the horizontal directions, SP2 and SP3.\n\nOnly SP2 and SP3 will work in the zero gravity of space. SP1 will be pushed to the stops by its silicon springs designed for Mars.\n\nAs the first snippets of data come down, we look immediately at the voltages of the three outputs - if the sensors have survived and are operational, they should be close to zero. SP1 is high, but that's as expected. SP2 and SP3 show low voltages - they're working! But how well?\n\nThe team, Constantinos, Alex, John and Zac, get down to analysing the full data.\n\nFirst we realise just how quiet our spacecraft is. All we are detecting on both our operational sensors is a very gentle background vibration.\n\nIf we play this signal speeded up on our headphones, it's an almost imperceptible hiss.\n\nThis signal is being created by the microseismometers themselves - in space, our sensors can be heard for the first time, without the interference from any oceans.\n\nEven better, this signal from the sensors themselves is very low, less than one billionth of the gravitational acceleration on the surface of Earth, 1g.\n\nOur accelerometers are not only working, they're working as well as we could have possibly expected.\n\nBumps in the night\n\nBut as we look further at the data, we see something else - there appear to be tiny jolts, every half hour or so, about a millionth of 1g. That's still one thousand times the noise from the sensors.\n\nThe jolts are seen at the same time on both SP2 and SP3, so are unlikely to be from the sensors themselves. That is certainly a relief. Could they be dust impacts?\n\nWe double check - the jolts are far too large, even if we were going right through a comet's tail. We're starting to think it must be the spacecraft itself.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The microseismometers picked up vibrations on the cruise to Mars, but what were they?\n\nThe sound from two of the microseismometers on the way to Mars, speeded up 1,000 times. The background hiss is the noise from the sensors themselves, and the chirps are the thrusters of the spacecraft as it keeps the solar arrays pointing at the Sun.\n\nWe're travelling on a twin of the Phoenix spacecraft that delivered another lander to Mars for Nasa 10 years ago.\n\nI know the mission well - I'd worked on the microscope station on the Phoenix lander - but had never paid much attention as to how we got to Mars.\n\nGoing through the papers, we find the Phoenix spacecraft used thrusters firing for a fraction of a second, to nudge its solar arrays to look straight at the Sun.\n\nAlthough too small to see with the instruments on Phoenix, our microseismometers on InSight should be able to detect these nudges. All we need now is confirmation from the spacecraft team of when the thrusters fired.\n\nAs dawn breaks on the States, we get back a list of the firing times.\n\nThey match perfectly with the jolts we're seeing on the microseismometers. It's an unanticipated test of our sensors, and of the Imperial team.\n\nIt's been extremely valuable to be able to test our microseismometers in space.\n\nAlthough landing is the riskiest part of our journey, we know they've survived the launch in perfect condition. Now there is just the small matter of getting down onto the surface of Mars in one piece."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Tossing dead salmon is good for plants", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46305004", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption For more than 20 years, students in a small corner of north-west US have been tossing dead fish\n\nNever mind silver bells and cockleshells, Mary should have tossed dead fish to help her garden grown.\n\nA team of US researchers has found that sockeye salmon carcasses has helped boost tree growth by up to 20%.\n\nOver a 20-year period, students from the University of Washington tossed dead fish from a stream on to a river bank.\n\nData shows the nutrients from the rotting flesh boosted growth in the area's trees.\n\nImage copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption Pacific salmon die shortly after returning to rivers to spawn\n\nWhat did the scientists do?\n\nFor two decades, students taking part in a long-term study on who/what was eating sockeye salmon in a stream in Alaska have been tossing fish carcasses on to one river bank in order to avoid double counting them during surveys.\n\n\"We would find carcasses on both sides of the stream, explained Prof Tom Quinn, who supervised the study.\n\n\"But we always tossed the carcasses on one side of the stream so effectively we were reducing the density of carcasses on one side and increasing the density of carcasses on the other.\n\n\"It was something of a natural fertilisation experiment.\"\n\nImage copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption In order to avoid counting carcasses twice, dead fish were hurled to a river bank\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nAfter taking samples from the surrounding trees of Hansen Creek, the scientists found that the fish carcasses (almost 300 tons over the 20-year period) had affected the growth rate of the trees.\n\n\"We took cores from live trees that we estimated to be at least 40 years old,\" observed Prof Quinn.\n\n\"We saw that the effect of the carcass manipulation was to accelerate the growth on that side.\n\n\"There was a significant increase in the growth of the trees on the side that we fertilised relative to how well they have been doing prior to the experiment.\"\n\nImage copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption Indigenous people have known for generations about the benefits fish carcasses provide\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nProf Quinn said the study highlighted the importance of long-term studies when observing ecological changes or influences because changes, such as dead fish fertilising soil, would not be detected in shorter studies."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report warns of growing impact on US life", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46325168", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nUnchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns.\n\n\"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today,\" the 4th National Climate Assessment says.\n\nThe report says climate change is \"presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth\".\n\nThe warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.\n\nSounding an alarm\n\nBy James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News\n\nDuring a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, \"whatever happened to global warming?\"\n\nNow, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss' question in comprehensive detail.\n\nGlobal warming is here in the US, they say - now.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

In their wake, they have left shrinking communities that struggle to support multiple businesses, schools and hospitals.\n\nThis is a common theme in the Midwestern state of Iowa, whose population has grown by less than a million people in the past century. As family farms have consolidated into megafarms run by large corporations, rural residents have moved to cities like Des Moines, the state capital, or left the state altogether.\n\n\u200bShrinking rural America\n\nThe northwest region of Iowa has been hit especially hard, forcing those who remain to drive farther and farther for things like groceries, education and health care.\n\nAt its peak, the town of Mallard hosted several grocery stores and restaurants, four churches, a cinema and two schools, one of them private. Today, its population of about 265 supports little more than a gas station and a couple of bars. The 100-year-old Catholic Church closed last summer, and the public school will close next year, forcing students to ride on buses to a neighboring town.\n\nKayla Lanning, a former horse training assistant, takes it all in her stride.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to it. It\u2019s not any big deal to us to have to travel a little ways,\u201d she said. In her case, \u201ca little ways\u201d can mean a two-hour drive.\n\nWhen Lanning learned she would be giving birth to twins, she was told that she could either schedule a cesarean section at her nearest hospital, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, or travel to a better-equipped hospital 135 kilometers (85 miles) away. She and her husband, John, chose to make the long drive and avoid the C-section.\n\nLuckily for the Lannings, the drive to the hospital was uneventful, aside from a police officer pulling them over for speeding. The babies were delivered in the hospital, but prematurely; that meant being transferred to yet another hospital, even farther away.\n\nLanning admits to being a little \u201cirritated\u201d by the distances involved, but accepts it as the part of the trade-off for staying in Mallard.\n\n\u200bFewer options\n\nBut not everyone is able to make it to a hospital with a proper obstetrics unit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to get a call from an ER (emergency room), where they say, \u2018We have a patient. She started bleeding, she\u2019s 28 weeks along, and she came in here\u2019\u201d to a hospital with no such unit, said Dr. Neil Mandsager, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies.\n\nMany hospitals don\u2019t even have an ultrasound machine to check the status of a baby, said Mandsager, the medical director of obstetrics at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines. As a result, he travels about 865 kilometers (540 miles) each month to pay weekly visits to patients in rural health care centers.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t isolated to Iowa, which ranks 36th among the 50 states in terms of population density. According to a University of Minnesota study published earlier this year, \u201c18 million reproductive-age women live in America\u2019s rural counties, but over half of these counties have no hospital\u201d where a woman can give birth.\n\nBigger gaps\n\nMandsager said Iowa \u201cdoes a pretty good job of creating a system that works as best as it can for the pregnant woman, but there\u2019s still definitely some gaps, and these gaps are getting bigger as these small hospitals close.\u201d\n\nTypically, obstetrics services in one to three maternity hospitals or obstetrics units close in Iowa each year, but this year, the number has spiked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a year when eight [obstetrics units] closed. That\u2019s a pretty high number,\u201d he said.\n\nMandsager, along with Stephanie Trusty, a nurse clinician at the Iowa Department of Public Health, attributes the closings to concerns over quality of care, malpractice insurance, profitability and low patient volume. They say it\u2019s also difficult to attract and retain physicians.\n\n\u201cIn rural Iowa, delivering babies is not scheduled. If they\u2019re a single practitioner in a rural area, then they\u2019re on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You know, that\u2019s hard,\u201d Trusty said.\n\nIn addition, there is the worry that so few deliveries can impact a physician\u2019s and nurse\u2019s ability to keep up their skills. Trusty said she looked at the maternity records of the eight hospitals that closed their obstetrics units or shut down altogether this year and found that three of them averaged less than one birth per week.\n\nNew mothers surveyed\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Health for years has used a survey given to new mothers as a way to assess concerns. The patient survey collects data on issues such as distance traveled and quality of care received. Trusty said the survey has had an extremely high response rate. Of the 40,000 yearly births in the state, the department receives about 20,000 survey responses.\n\nSurprisingly, she said, those responses haven\u2019t reinforced their fears.\n\n\u201cWe asked \u2018did they have trouble getting prenatal care,\u2019 and very few were refused care, and most people said it was still easy to get access,\u201d Trusty said. \u201cOn how many miles they drove? The data didn\u2019t change for years and years, so we took it off our survey.\u201d\n\nThat was five years ago. Because of the large number of maternity ward closings this year, Trusty said they will reintroduce the question about \u201cdistance traveled\u201d in next year\u2019s survey.\n\nAs for whether couples may be dissuaded from settling in smaller towns because of these longer commutes, Lanning said it didn\u2019t factor into her decision.\n\n\u201cWe are so grounded here. John grew up here, and everything we know and do is here. So yeah, that doesn\u2019t affect that,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Former Trump Aide Ordered to Start Serving 14-day Jail Term", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/former-trump-aide-ordered-to-start-serving-14-day-jail-term/4673160.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "A one-time foreign affairs adviser to President Donald Trump has been ordered to start serving a 14-day jail term on Monday for lying to investigators about his role in Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos had sought to delay his brief sentence while awaiting for an appellate court ruling in a separate case challenging the constitutionality of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose ongoing investigation of Trump campaign aides' links to Russia ensnared Papadopoulos.\n\nU.S. District Judge Randolph Moss on Sunday rejected the bid by Papadopoulos to remain free and delay his jail term, noting that when he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators he had waived his right to appeal his plea agreement. Moss had also fined Papadopoulos $9,500 and ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service.\n\nMoss also noted that two other judges had already upheld the constitutionality of Mueller's appointment and said there was only a \"remote\" chance that the new challenge would end with a \"contrary conclusion.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Papadopoulos is a relatively minor figure in the 18-month Mueller investigation. He pled guilty to lying to investigators in January 2017 about the extent of his contacts with people who had connections with Russia and the timing of the contacts.\n\nIn discussing the names of his advisers during the 2016 campaign, Trump once described Papadopoulos as \"an excellent guy.\" In March 2016, Trump posted a picture on Instagram of his foreign affairs advisory council, with Papadopoulos sitting at the then-candidate's table for the meeting.\n\nBut when news of Papadopoulos's guilty plea surfaced, Trump said on Twitter, \"Few people knew the young, low-level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.\"\n\nAnother Trump campaign aide disparaged Papadopoulos as a volunteer \"coffee boy.\"\n\nBut that assessment drew a rebuke from Papadopoulos's then fiancee and now wife who said he was \u201cconstantly in touch with high-level officials in the campaign.\u201d\n\nMoreover, she said, he did not know how to make coffee.\n\nTrump, who often has dismissed Mueller's probe as a \"witch hunt,\" last week submitted written answers to the prosecutor's questions about the 2016 campaign, but it is not clear whether Mueller will seek to further question the president.\n\nBesides Papadopoulos, several Trump aides have been convicted or pleaded guilty to various offenses linked to the campaign or lobbying work before joining Trump's 2016 campaign."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Fights, Escape Attempts, Harm: Migrant Kids Struggle in Facilities", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fights-escape-attempts-harm-migrant-kids-struggle-in-facilities/4672818.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "In one government facility for immigrant youths, a 20-year-old woman who had lied that she was 17 sneaked a needle out of a sewing class and used it to cut herself.\n\nIn another, cameras captured a boy repeatedly kicking a child in the head after they got into an argument on the soccer field.\n\nOne 6-year-old tried to run away from the same facility after another boy threw his shoes into the toilet. Three employees had to pull the boy off a fence and carry him back into a building.\n\n\u200b14,000 children detained\n\nRecords obtained by The Associated Press highlight some of the problems that plague government facilities for immigrant youths at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been making moves in recent weeks that could send even more migrant children into detention.\n\nAbout 14,000 immigrant children are detained in more than 100 facilities nationally, with about 5,900 in Texas. Many crossed the border without their parents and are having to wait longer in detention to be placed with relatives or sponsors, who are being dissuaded to come forward out of fear they\u2019ll be arrested and deported.\n\nHundreds of children who were separated from their parents earlier this year were also detained in these facilities, but most of them have since been released to their parents.\n\nOvertaxed system\n\nAmid the global uproar over family separation, the Trump administration presented the facilities as caring, safe places for immigrant children.\n\nBut as records obtained by the AP show, the child detention system is overtaxed. Children are acting out, sometimes hitting each other and trying to escape, and staff members struggle to deal with escalating problems.\n\nDoctors have warned for months about the consequences of detaining children for long periods of time, particularly after most of them had fled violence and poverty in Central America and undertaken the dangerous journey to the U.S.\n\n\u201cBeing in detention can be a form of trauma,\u201d said Dr. Alan Shapiro, a pediatrician who works directly with immigrant children. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat children for trauma while we\u2019re traumatizing them at the same time.\u201d\n\nSexual abuse in Arizona\n\nSouthwest Key Programs, a Texas-based nonprofit, operates the facilities where the three incidents occurred. In Arizona, the organization agreed in October to close two facilities and stop accepting more children at others as part of a settlement with the state, which was investigating whether the organization conducted adequate background checks of staff. One former employee was convicted this year of sexually abusing multiple boys.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, Southwest Key is pushing to expand. It has sued Houston after local officials tried to stop the opening of a facility.\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it reported all three incidents on its own and that it was committed to correcting any problems.\n\n\u201cAs long as immigrant children are forced to leave their homes due to violence and poverty, we want to provide them with compassionate care and help reunify them with family safely and quickly,\u201d the group said.\n\nSouthwest Key\u2019s facilities are licensed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which inspects child detention centers and released inspection records to the AP.\n\nThe U.S. government has also set up a temporary facility in Tornillo, Texas, that isn\u2019t licensed by the state because it\u2019s located on federal property. There, roughly 1,800 children are housed in large tents at much higher costs than the licensed facilities. That\u2019s up from 320 in June, at the height of the family separation crisis.\n\nRepeated investigations\n\nOne facility that was repeatedly flagged was Casa El Presidente in Brownsville, Texas, operated by Southwest Key.\n\nAs parents were being arrested and separated from their infants and young children, Casa El Presidente became one of three Texas \u201ctender age\u201d facilities that took in their kids. A group of congressmen who visited in June said the facility had an infant room with high chairs and toys, where staff members were caring for babies.\n\nCasa El Presidente multiplied in size during the family separation crisis. According to the state\u2019s monthly head counts, the facility went from 56 children in June to 367 in the most recent count taken Nov. 15.\n\nA shift supervisor told a state inspector June 26 that more staff were quitting and that workers \u201cstruggle with implementing healthy boundaries for children of this age.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe admitted staff are afraid to touch the children,\u201d the inspector wrote in a report.\n\nThe supervisor said Casa El Presidente had to change its policy on restraining young children who were misbehaving, because holding them for too short a time was \u201cescalating instead of de-escalating.\u201d Southwest Key said an example of a typical restraint would be holding a child\u2019s arm or shoulder, and that it doesn\u2019t use mechanical restraints.\n\nThe facility was cited for improperly restraining a 6-year-old boy who tried in July to climb a playground fence and run away.\n\nThe boy was identified in an inspection report by his first name, Osman. Staff members told an inspector that two days before Osman ran to the fence, two other boys had placed his shoes in a toilet. Osman \u201calso expressed frustration about being in the shelter away from his family,\u201d the report said.\n\nThree staff members eventually carried Osman away from the fence and back into the building.\n\nThe same month, two boys named Luis and Franklin got into a fight after Luis apparently kicked a soccer ball that Franklin said belonged to him. An inspector who viewed the facility\u2019s video wrote that Franklin chased Luis and punched him, causing Luis to fall.\n\n\u201cFranklin starts to kick him, once again making contact and kicking Luis in the face,\u201d the inspector wrote. Employees \u201cnever make efforts to move Franklin away from Luis; the staff just hold him.\u201d\n\nThe inspector cited the facility for not properly intervening to stop the kicks.\n\nAt Casa Rio Grande in San Benito, Texas, one of the people living there was a 20-year-old who told the staff she was 17. An investigation report identified her as Julia.\n\nJulia told an inspector that she took a needle from a sewing class and used it to cut herself because \u201cshe felt alone.\u201d She hid her wrist for around two weeks under a sweater, but when she forgot to wear her sweater one day, a staff member spotted the marks.\n\nIn each case, inspectors interviewed other minors detained at the facility. According to the reports, the other youths said they were treated well, had enough food, and felt respected by the staff.\n\nJeff Eller, a spokesman for Southwest Key, acknowledged that staff morale has suffered this year because of the unprecedented demands.\n\n\u201cWe are against family separations at the border,\u201d Eller said. \u201cKeeping families together is better for the children, parents, and communities.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Memos to Nobody: Inside the Work of a Neglected Fed Agency", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/merit-systems-protection-board-mark-robbins-us-agency/4672801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Mark Robbins gets to work at 8:15 each morning and unlocks the door to his office suite. He switches on the lights and the TV news, brews a pot of coffee and pulls out the first files of the day to review.\n\nFor the next eight hours or so, he reads through federal workplace disputes, analyzes the cases, marks them with notes and logs his legal opinions. When he's finished, he slips the files into a cardboard box and carries them into an empty room where they will sit and wait. For nobody.\n\nHe's at 1,520 files and counting.\n\nSuch is the lot of the last man standing in this forgotten corner of Donald Trump's Washington. For nearly two years, while Congress has argued and the White House has delayed, Robbins has waited to be sent some colleagues to read his work and rule on the cases. No one has arrived. So he toils in vain, writing memos into the void.\n\nRobbins is a one-man microcosm of a current strand of government dysfunction. His office isn't a high-profile political target. No politician has publicly pledged to slash his budget. But his agency's work has effectively been neutered through neglect. Promising to shrink the size of government, the president has been slow to fill posts and the Republican-led Congress has struggled to win approval for nominees. The combined effect isn't always dramatic, but it's strikingly clear when examined up close.\n\n\"It's a series of unfortunate events,'' says Robbins, who has had plenty of time to contemplate the absurdity of his situation. Still, he doesn't blame Trump or the government for his predicament. \"There's no one thing that created this problem that could have been fixed. It was a series of things randomly thrown together to create where we are.''\n\nRobbins is a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, a quasi-judicial federal body designed to determine whether civil servants have been mistreated by their employers. The three members are presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed for staggered seven-year terms. After one member termed out in 2015 and a second did so in January 2017, both without replacements lined up, Robbins became the sole member and acting chairman. The board needs at least two members to decide cases.\n\nThat's a problem for the federal workers and whistleblowers whose 1,000-plus grievances hang in the balance, stalled by the board's inability to settle them. When Robbins' term ends on March 1, the board probably will sit empty for the first time in its 40-year history.\n\nIt's also a problem for Robbins. A new board, whenever it's appointed and approved, will start from scratch. That means while new members can read Robbins' notes, his thousand-plus decisions will simply vanish.\n\n\"There is zero chance, zero chance my votes will count,'' the 59-year-old lawyer says, running his fingers over the spines leather-bound volumes lined up neatly on a shelf. Inside are the board's published rulings. None of the opinions he's working on will make it into one of them.\n\n\"Imagine having the last year and half of your work just ... disappear,'' he said.\n\nDespite the choke of files piled up everywhere else, Robbins' office is remarkably orderly. Three paperweights rest on stacks of papers on his desk: a stone from Babel province, a memento from his time working for the State Department in Iraq; a model of the White House, to commemorate his tenure under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush; and a medallion bearing the merit board's seal. This job, which pays about $155,000 a year, \"has been the honor of my life,'' he says.\n\nIn the corner, a potted plant he rescued from a trash can outside his condo six years ago is now so tall that it's bumping up against the ceiling, growing in circles.\n\nHe swears it's not a metaphor.\n\nRobbins, a Republican, was excited when Trump won the election. The president chooses two board members of his or her own party, and the Senate minority leader picks a third. Robbins assumed he'd finally be in the majority after years of serving alongside Democrats, soon able to write opinions rather than just logging dissent.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nTrump was in office a year before he nominated two board members, a pair of Republicans, including Robbins' replacement. A third nominee, a Democrat, was named three months later, in June.\n\nAssuming they'd be swiftly confirmed, Robbins quickly began preparing for their arrival, leaving customized notes with comments and suggestions for the nominees based on their distinct personalities and experience on each case.\n\nHe'd at least impart a little wisdom, he thought.\n\nBut months went by and still no vote. Robbins said he was told the Democrats were refusing to confirm the two Republicans by unanimous consent, insisting instead on a full debate for each. In late September, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs subcommittee that screens nominees told Robbins it probably would not be able to confirm the appointees before the end of the current Congress. That meant that the entire process, which typically takes several months when there are no complications, will begin again come January, with no guarantee the nominees will be the same.\n\nNow his pile of personalized sticky notes is bound for the trash, too.\n\nTall, slim and bald, Robbins is an eternal optimist. He sees the futility of the piles of paper and empty offices. But he's determined to keep the trains running, even if he's the only one on the ride.\n\n\"It's not like I'm sitting around on the sofa watching soap operas and eating bonbons. I'm still doing my job,'' he said. \"It's only when the agency stops working that people realize what we do and the value we bring.''\n\n\"Maybe someday they'll say, `Good old Robbins, he just kept plugging along.'''\n\nFrustrating? Yes. But at least it makes for a good story at parties.\n\n\"When I say to people, `And then my votes just disappear,' the crowd usually goes `Oh, no!''' he said. \"And there's empathy, there's real empathy.''\n\nThe board, established in 1978, is responsible for protecting 2.1 million federal employees from bias and unfair treatment in the workplace. The board handles appeals from whistleblowers and other civil servants who say they were mistreated or wrongly fired, and want to challenge an initial ruling by an administrative judge. The board also conducts independent research and writes policy papers destined for the president's desk.\n\nOr it used to.\n\nRobbins is quick to point out the staffing crisis began under President Barack Obama, back when Robbins' first colleague termed out without a replacement.\n\nOthers say it's the Trump administration's fault.\n\nTrump has lagged slightly behind his predecessors in nominating political appointees. As of Nov. 19, he had nominated people for 929 positions, compared with Obama's 984 and Bush's 1,128 at the same point in their presidencies. Congress has acted on just 69 percent of those nominations, according to data provided by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization promoting government efficiency.\n\nMax Stier, the partnership's CEO, blames the administration, the Senate and a dysfunctional system of appointing and confirming political nominees.\n\n\"There are many different flavors of the same problem,'' he said. He cited several other vacancies, including assistant secretary for South Asian affairs at the State Department, deputy secretary and undersecretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the deputy secretary at the Homeland Security Department, among others. \"There is so much going on, but the underlying reality is that our basic government is suffering.''\n\nJohn Palguta, former director of policy and evaluation for the merit board, called the delay \"outrageous.''\n\n\"We're setting a new standard, and it's particularly severe and unfortunate at MSPB because of the structure of the agency. It just can't operate. And to let it go for this long, that's really unconscionable,'' Palguta said. \"The administration simply hasn't done its job.''\n\nSen. James Lankford, who chairs the Senate Home Security and Government Affairs' Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management said in a statement he understands the urgency in filling these positions.\n\n\"There are over 1,500 individuals waiting for their cases to be heard, but there are not board members in place which means the backlog cannot be addressed,'' said Lankford, R-Okla.\n\nRobbins keeps plugging away and the cases keep piling up.\n\n\"We are running out of space,'' he said, shimmying between towers of boxes in a storage closet close to 6 feet tall. More boxes are stacked against the hallway wall and piled up in the clerk's office.\n\n\"Any additional cases I work from now on are just, grains of sand on a beach.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "White House Says Dire Climate Report Based on 'Extreme Scenario'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-says-dire-climate-report-based-on-extreme-scenario-/4672409.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration is downplaying the significance of a report issued Friday that included dire predictions about the impact of climate change in the U.S. The White House said the study was largely based on \"the most extreme scenario\" and doesn't account for new technology and other innovations that could diminish carbon emissions and the effects of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe National Climate Assessment, the fourth edition of a congressionally mandated report on climate change, noted that disasters caused by weather are becoming more common. The report, prepared by more than 300 researchers in 13 U.S. government departments and agencies, predicts that those events will become more common and more severe if steps aren't taken \"to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters noted that work on the assessment began under the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama and uses multiple modeling scenarios to assess the effects of climate change. But the report issued Friday, according to Walters, relies too heavily on the worst-case-scenario.\n\n\n\n\"The report is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population,\" Walters said in a statement.\n\n\n\nShe said the next climate assessment, which will be prepared over the next four years, will \"provide for a more transparent and data-driven process that includes fuller information on the range of potential scenarios and outcomes.\"\n\n\n\nWalters also pointed out that, since 2005, carbon dioxide emissions related to energy production in the U.S. have declined 14 percent, while global emissions continue to rise.\n\n\n\nWhile that's true, the U.S. remains the second largest emitter of carbon dioxide, behind only China.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration has rolled back several environmental regulations put in place during the Obama administration and has promoted the production of fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nLast year, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which had been signed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change. He argued the agreement would hurt the U.S. economy and said there is little evidence in its environmental benefit.\n\n\n\nTrump, as well as several members of his Cabinet, have also cast doubt on the science of climate change, saying the causes of global warming are not yet settled.\n\n\n\nWhite House Bureau Chief Steve Herman contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Fires, Floods and Other Disasters Await New Governors", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fires-floods-and-other-disasters-await-new-governors/4672319.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Governors have a wide range of priorities they want to tackle in the coming year, from tax reform to education. Yet it\u2019s a topic that receives less attention on the campaign trail and in their speeches that could determine their success \u2014 natural disasters.\n\nIn the last two years alone, storms and natural disasters have killed scores of people, damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes and cost tens of billions of dollars.\n\nWildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have been especially destructive, and scientists say climate change is making this more common. As the severity escalates, governors are finding they have to make disaster planning a priority or risk the consequences of inaction defining their terms and enraging voters.\n\nHandling disasters and emergencies was a prime topic last week when the National Governors Association held a three-day seminar in Colorado that most of the nation\u2019s 19 governors-elect attended.\n\n\u201cAs California\u2019s wildfires, a spate of hurricanes, and unfortunate acts of mass violence have demonstrated, such events can occur at any time,\u201d Scott Pattison, the nonpartisan association\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement, \u201cincluding a governor\u2019s first day in office.\u201d\n\nFor many Democratic governors especially, the main concern is how climate change appears to be worsening the effects of natural disasters.\n\nIn California, half of the 10 most destructive wildfires in state history have occurred since 2017, and the costliest have been in each of the past three years, according to the state firefighting agency. The state has spent $500 million from its emergency firefighting fund just since July 1, putting this wildfire season on pace to be among the costliest yet.\n\nThe state is dealing with its most destructive wildfire ever, a Northern California blaze that leveled a town of 27,000 this month, killed at least 80 people and left thousands homeless. That blaze, and another that roared through Malibu at the same time and left at least three dead, are the latest in a string of catastrophic wildfires that have put the state in what seems like a perpetual state of emergency.\n\nOutgoing Gov. Jerry Brown has called California\u2019s mega fires \u201cthe new abnormal\u201d as climate change turns the state warmer and drier.\n\nThe escalating destruction prompted state lawmakers to pass a series of wildfire-related bills this year. Among other provisions, they provide millions of dollars to cut trees and brush, make it easier for property owners to clear their land and require the state\u2019s utilities to step up their fire-prevention efforts.\n\nDuring his campaign, incoming Gov. Gavin Newsom said wildfire planning would be a priority for his administration and outlined a number of steps he wants to take. Among them is a more aggressive approach to clearing trees and brush, particularly the state\u2019s millions of dead trees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather see our National Guard working on those kinds of emergencies than being on the border,\u201d Newsom told the nonprofit news organization CALmatters over the summer.\n\nHe also proposed deploying a network of infrared cameras to detect wildfires early, improving the emergency alert system and boosting funding for fire departments throughout the state.\n\nA spokesman, Nathan Click, said Newsom is putting together a comprehensive wildfire strategy as he prepares to take office in early January. But the governor-elect also has been clear that the long-term goal must be reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s fire season has been especially severe, yet other Western states also have experienced ever-intensifying wildland blazes in recent years.\n\nIn Colorado, the two most destructive wildfires in state history erupted within the last six years, killed a total of four people and destroyed more than 850 homes combined. Both are believed to be caused by humans, leading Democrat Jared Polis, Colorado\u2019s governor-elect, to call for a public education campaign to reduce the possibility of manmade wildfires.\n\nHe also said the state should invest in programs to remove flammable debris and help communities and private landowners take steps to prevent the spread of wildfires.\n\nNearly 1 million people in Colorado live in areas considered to have at least some risk of a devastating fire.\n\nFlorida has been hit with two deadly and destructive hurricanes in roughly a year\u2019s time. Hurricanes Irma last year and Michael in October caused tens of billions of dollars in damage.\n\nEven without hurricanes, many coastal communities are dealing with flooding from high tides and storm surges. Incoming Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has already said he will work with local governments to address rising sea levels, but has been criticized by Democrats for avoiding any mention of climate change in his environmental plan.\n\nDeSantis has said he is neither a climate change \u201cdenier\u201d nor a \u201cbeliever.\u201d That could be a problem for identifying long-term solutions to keep coastal communities safe, said Jen Hensley, the director of state lobbying and advocacy at the Sierra Club.\n\nShe said one reason Hurricane Michael was so devastating was a lack of strong statewide coastal development standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to change zoning rules in coastal areas,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cThe reality is that those areas are more flood prone than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s similar in Texas, which has seen widespread destruction from hurricanes and where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has been noncommittal about whether he thinks human activity is affecting the climate.\n\nTexas has sought $12 billion from the federal government for a 60-mile coastal \u201cspine\u201d of concrete seawalls, floating gates and steel levees as a defense against future hurricanes and higher tides expected from climate change. That\u2019s just a fraction of the work the state estimates need to be done over the next decade to reduce the impact of flooding.\n\nIn 2017, Hurricane Harvey left Houston underwater, killed dozens and left an estimated $125 billion in damage. Abbott named a recovery czar after the storm and wants to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the Texas coast, but attention on the issue has faded.\n\nGovernors in New York and New Jersey pushed for changes after Superstorm Sandy devastated the region in 2012.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed a law requiring sea level rise projections to be used whenever the state considers approvals or funding for projects. Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, pushed policies to buy homes in some flood-prone areas, although environmentalists criticized him for not addressing climate change.\n\nThose groups cheered last year when Democrat Phil Murphy was elected to replace Christie, but they have been critical of him too since, saying he\u2019s not taking action to address global warming.\n\nEarlier this month, Murphy experienced the perils of falling short on the basics of emergency preparedness when an early season snowstorm hit without plows at the ready, bringing roads and the transit system to a standstill and stranding thousands of commuters.\n\nHe was hit with waves of criticism, and his transportation commissioner was forced to apologize.\n\nMurphy said it was too simplistic to say his administration \u201cdropped the ball.\u201d But he added, \u201cThe buck stops with me, period.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Many in Rural US Find Fewer Maternity Care Options", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/many-in-rural-us-find-fewer-maternity-care-options/4672835.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "For decades, Americans have migrated toward urban areas seeking opportunities, emptying out large swaths of countryside. In their wake, they have left shrinking communities that struggle to support multiple businesses, schools and hospitals.\n\nThis is a common theme in the Midwestern state of Iowa, whose population has grown by less than a million people in the past century. As family farms have consolidated into megafarms run by large corporations, rural residents have moved to cities like Des Moines, the state capital, or left the state altogether.\n\n\u200bShrinking rural America\n\nThe northwest region of Iowa has been hit especially hard, forcing those who remain to drive farther and farther for things like groceries, education and health care.\n\nAt its peak, the town of Mallard hosted several grocery stores and restaurants, four churches, a cinema and two schools, one of them private. Today, its population of about 265 supports little more than a gas station and a couple of bars. The 100-year-old Catholic Church closed last summer, and the public school will close next year, forcing students to ride on buses to a neighboring town.\n\nKayla Lanning, a former horse training assistant, takes it all in her stride.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to it. It\u2019s not any big deal to us to have to travel a little ways,\u201d she said. In her case, \u201ca little ways\u201d can mean a two-hour drive.\n\nWhen Lanning learned she would be giving birth to twins, she was told that she could either schedule a cesarean section at her nearest hospital, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, or travel to a better-equipped hospital 135 kilometers (85 miles) away. She and her husband, John, chose to make the long drive and avoid the C-section.\n\nLuckily for the Lannings, the drive to the hospital was uneventful, aside from a police officer pulling them over for speeding. The babies were delivered in the hospital, but prematurely; that meant being transferred to yet another hospital, even farther away.\n\nLanning admits to being a little \u201cirritated\u201d by the distances involved, but accepts it as the part of the trade-off for staying in Mallard.\n\n\u200bFewer options\n\nBut not everyone is able to make it to a hospital with a proper obstetrics unit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to get a call from an ER (emergency room), where they say, \u2018We have a patient. She started bleeding, she\u2019s 28 weeks along, and she came in here\u2019\u201d to a hospital with no such unit, said Dr. Neil Mandsager, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies.\n\nMany hospitals don\u2019t even have an ultrasound machine to check the status of a baby, said Mandsager, the medical director of obstetrics at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines. As a result, he travels about 865 kilometers (540 miles) each month to pay weekly visits to patients in rural health care centers.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t isolated to Iowa, which ranks 36th among the 50 states in terms of population density. According to a University of Minnesota study published earlier this year, \u201c18 million reproductive-age women live in America\u2019s rural counties, but over half of these counties have no hospital\u201d where a woman can give birth.\n\nBigger gaps\n\nMandsager said Iowa \u201cdoes a pretty good job of creating a system that works as best as it can for the pregnant woman, but there\u2019s still definitely some gaps, and these gaps are getting bigger as these small hospitals close.\u201d\n\nTypically, obstetrics services in one to three maternity hospitals or obstetrics units close in Iowa each year, but this year, the number has spiked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a year when eight [obstetrics units] closed. That\u2019s a pretty high number,\u201d he said.\n\nMandsager, along with Stephanie Trusty, a nurse clinician at the Iowa Department of Public Health, attributes the closings to concerns over quality of care, malpractice insurance, profitability and low patient volume. They say it\u2019s also difficult to attract and retain physicians.\n\n\u201cIn rural Iowa, delivering babies is not scheduled. If they\u2019re a single practitioner in a rural area, then they\u2019re on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You know, that\u2019s hard,\u201d Trusty said.\n\nIn addition, there is the worry that so few deliveries can impact a physician\u2019s and nurse\u2019s ability to keep up their skills. Trusty said she looked at the maternity records of the eight hospitals that closed their obstetrics units or shut down altogether this year and found that three of them averaged less than one birth per week.\n\nNew mothers surveyed\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Health for years has used a survey given to new mothers as a way to assess concerns. The patient survey collects data on issues such as distance traveled and quality of care received. Trusty said the survey has had an extremely high response rate. Of the 40,000 yearly births in the state, the department receives about 20,000 survey responses.\n\nSurprisingly, she said, those responses haven\u2019t reinforced their fears.\n\n\u201cWe asked \u2018did they have trouble getting prenatal care,\u2019 and very few were refused care, and most people said it was still easy to get access,\u201d Trusty said. \u201cOn how many miles they drove? The data didn\u2019t change for years and years, so we took it off our survey.\u201d\n\nThat was five years ago. Because of the large number of maternity ward closings this year, Trusty said they will reintroduce the question about \u201cdistance traveled\u201d in next year\u2019s survey.\n\nAs for whether couples may be dissuaded from settling in smaller towns because of these longer commutes, Lanning said it didn\u2019t factor into her decision.\n\n\u201cWe are so grounded here. John grew up here, and everything we know and do is here. So yeah, that doesn\u2019t affect that,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "NASA's Latest Mars Probe to Attempt Landing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-s-latest-mars-probe-to-attempt-landing-/4672489.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "After traveling hundreds of millions of miles through space, NASA's latest Mars probe will arrive Monday at the Red Planet.\n\nScientists have carefully chosen where they want the probe, called InSight, to land, selecting a large volcanic plain named Elysium Planitia. They say the site has few rocks and less chance of wind gusts that could potentially knock over the lander.\n\nThe spacecraft will take a crucial six minutes to enter Mars' atmosphere, descend and land. During that time, InSight will decelerate from an initial speed of 19,300 kmh (12,000 mph) down to just 8 kmh (5 mph) when it touches down. To aid the landing, scientists have equipped InSight with a parachute, descent thrusters and shock-absorbing legs.\n\nIf all goes well, InSight will make the eighth successful landing on Mars.\n\n\"My heart is beating inside of my chest like a drum,\" NASA project manager Tom Hoffman said Wednesday during a news conference about the planned landing.\n\nScientists say they are trying to determine whether the craft needs a small nudge to put it in the proper place for landing. Since InSight launched May 5, scientists have made four small tweaks to its path to ensure it arrives on target. Engineers were able to skip an additional nudge because the other maneuvers went so smoothly, and they say they might also be able to skip the final adjustment scheduled for Sunday.\n\nBy the time it lands, InSight will have traveled 484 million kilometers (300.7 million miles). However, once the lander is on the Martian surface, it cannot move, as it is not a rover. Scientists say it is critical that InSight land in the correct location, because wherever it lands is where it will stay.\n\nNASA says the landing site has been particularly quiet in recent weeks, with few storms.\n\n\u201cWe're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" said Rob Grover who is overseeing the landing phase.\n\nOnce landed, Insight has a unique mission to explore Mars' interior. While other missions have sought to better understand the planet's surface and atmosphere, this is the first to focus exclusively on what is under Mars' surface.\n\nThe $850 million InSight mission is planned to last about two years and will try to gather an array of information, including Mars' below-ground temperature and seismic activity, as well as to carry out an underground mapping project.\n\nInsight is armed with a crane, heat probe and seismometer and is able to hammer 5 meters (16.4 feet) below the surface.\n\nScientists are hoping the mission will help answer questions about the composition and evolution of the planet and whether Mars was formed from the same mixture of materials as Earth.\n\nOnce InSight touches down, it will wait for 16 minutes to allow the dust that it kicked up to settle down again. Then it will deploy solar arrays, a critical step that will allow the lander to power itself for the next two years. InSight also has a battery system, but that will only last one day.\n\nThe lander is expected to touch down on Mars about 3 p.m. EST (2000 UTC) on Monday. Scientists hope to know quickly whether the landing was successful but say if communication with the spacecraft is delayed, they might not know InSight's status for several hours or even days.\n\nNASA's website will be broadcasting news of InSight's approach and landing all day Monday."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Ranchers Combat Overgrazing to Protect Climate", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ranchers-combat-overgrazing-to-fight-climate-change/4670713.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Meredith Ellis gets a bit rapturous about the little patch of earth under her feet.\n\nWhen she bought this northern Texas land several years ago, it was overgrazed and overrun with weeds. Now, she\u2019s thrilled to find a dark green blob of fungus she rolls under her sparkly-nail-polished thumb. She picks a tiny patch of the green moss from between clumps of tall brown grass gone dormant with the fall chill.\n\n\u201cLook at all these little bits of biodiversity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a little fantasy world going on in there.\u201d\n\nBringing it back has been a labor of love \u2014 love of the G Bar C Ranch where she grew up, and for the 4-year-old son she\u2019s raising here.\n\n\u201cEverything I do, I think about him now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about his future, and what is this world going to look like when he\u2019s my age?\u201d\n\nEllis worries about the droughts, floods and other calamities he may face from climate change. She wonders if there even will be enough food to go around.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason why she raises her cattle a bit differently than most.\n\nThe differences not only help to combat climate change. They also provide more clean water. They can even save ranchers money. And if one project goes forward, farmers may get financial rewards for making the changes.\n\nMeadows vs. lawns\n\nEllis\u2019s fields look like meadows. Her cattle forage among an assortment of thigh-high native grasses.\n\nOther ranches nearby look like giant lawns. Cows have grazed the grass monocultures nearly down to the ground.\n\nThe difference matters, says rangeland scientist Jeff Goodwin with the Noble Research Institute, because the native grass is \u201cnot only feeding this cow herd. It\u2019s also feeding the underground herd: the microbes, the biology in the soil. That\u2019s what really makes that soil an active, living, breathing system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a system with the potential to remove tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe more forage production that we\u2019re getting, the deeper the root systems, the more carbon we\u2019re sequestering out of the atmosphere,\u201d Goodwin added.\n\nThat\u2019s increasingly important. Scientists warn that the world needs to do more than just stop producing greenhouse gases in order to avoid the worst of climate change. Carbon dioxide needs to be actively removed from the atmosphere in order to keep the planet from potentially catastrophic warming.\n\nWhile engineers puzzle over high-tech solutions, a recent report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says nature offers tools that are ready to go today.\n\nValuable ecosystem services\n\nGrasslands and the soils beneath them act as giant carbon sinks, the report notes.\n\nBut not if they are overgrazed.\n\nAround the world, one estimate says, about 200 million hectares are overgrazed, an area roughly the size of Mexico.\n\nOne study estimates that optimizing grazing could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 89 million metric tons, roughly the same as permanently parking 19 million cars.\n\nPlus, overgrazed land erodes more easily. That\u2019s a double whammy. Ranchers lose fertile soil, and it ends up muddying drinking water downstream, which increases the cost to make it tap-ready.\n\nOn the other hand, healthy grassland soils that store carbon also store and filter water.\n\nThose benefits should be worth money, Goodwin said. They\u2019re known as ecosystem services, and the Noble Research Institute is working to develop a marketplace for them. Ranchers would earn credits based on their soil\u2019s carbon content and its water storage and filtration capacity.\n\nSome major food and beverage companies are interested in the market. Many have set goals to improve sustainability up and down their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really a solid path forward\u201d for many of them to meet those goals, Goodwin said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re sitting in a very good position to be able to provide that opportunity.\u201d\n\nAll profits from the soil\n\nMany of the steps ranchers could take to earn ecosystem service credits would help their bottom lines anyway.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to talk about soil health building as a thing to do for the environment. But really, it\u2019s something we need to be doing for our profitability as well,\u201d said Michael Vance, managing partner at Stark Ranch, a short drive from Ellis\u2019 operation.\n\n\u201cAll your profit comes from the soil,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stood in a field where cattle had recently been grazing, but you\u2019d never know it. The grass still stood tall. His neighbors don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t let the cows graze it all the way down. They think he\u2019s wasting it.\n\n\u201cWe get phone calls where people want to drive a bailer in here and bail up this grass, but they don\u2019t realize the positives that come by leaving it standing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe field grows more grass when cattle are moved off it sooner. That means Vance buys less feed.\n\nEven if it\u2019s more profitable, it\u2019s not easy for people to change their ways, and ranchers are a conservative bunch.\n\n\u201cYou realize things that you were raised doing, things that your dad and your granddad did, maybe weren\u2019t the best things to do,\u201d Vance said, \u201cfrom an environmental perspective, maybe from even a profitability perspective.\u201d\n\nFinancial incentives might help other ranchers make changes, he adds.\n\nThe Noble Research Institute plans to launch a pilot ecosystem services market in 2019 and is aiming for a full rollout in 2022."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Developed in Australia Shows Promise", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/new-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis-developed-in-australia/4672104.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Australian researchers have made a breakthrough in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis using immunotherapy.

Now, progressives are starting to talk about how to challenge the power of the sitting Supreme Court.\n\nThe issues under discussion range from process reforms like ending lifetime appointments and enacting recusal and ethics laws to stripping the court of jurisdiction and retaking \u201cstolen\u201d seats. Many of the ideas have been debated by legal scholars in decades past, but the rise in interest among progressive political partisans is decisively new. And even though opinions on the path forward diverge, and lawmakers have yet to jump on the bandwagon, the discussions are evidence of a new adversarial posture toward the court for progressives and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe disempowerment that progressives are feeling is one familiar to conservatives who have long viewed the court with a mix of suspicion and outright hostility.\n\n\u201cProgressives have felt that they were well taken care of in the judiciary and that we had secured a lot of important rights with this past litigation mid-century and that was going to be the way we would defend our gain,\u201d Todd Tucker, a legal scholar at the progressive Roosevelt Institute, said.\n\nThe same 20th-century rulings led by chief justice Earl Warren\u2019s court and and the early years of chief justice Warren Burger\u2019s term in office that progressives have long sought to defend \u2015 the end of segregation, the ban on compulsory school prayer and the legalization of abortion \u2015 galvanized conservative Christians into a political bloc within the Republican Party. They were joined by business conservatives looking to roll back rules and regulations established from the New Deal through the consumer safety and environmental protections of the 1970s.\n\nThe fervent opposition to these court rulings led to a better understanding among grassroots conservatives of the court as a political entity that could be changed over time. It also birthed a decadeslong campaign to remake the court as the conservative bulwark it had been for most of its history.\n\nIn the past two months, progressives have started a similar debate on how to reform the court in opinion pieces, legal white papers, roundtables and partisan activism efforts.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The contentious confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh has lit a fire under progressives upset about a broken confirmation process and a newly hard right court.\n\nReforms On The Table\n\nLegal scholars have been debating the idea of 18-year term limits for justices since at least 1986. This reform would allow each president to appoint two new justices per four-year term. Justices who are term-limited off of the Supreme Court would not leave the judiciary but would rotate out to ride the circuit courts. Some argue it is a way to lower the political temperature of confirmation hearings and is constitutionally plausible (although definitely not bulletproof). Vanderbilt University law professor Ganesh Sitaraman, however, said at a recent event hosted by the American Constitution Society that it actually raises the political stakes by making every single presidential election a referendum on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe imposition of term limits and other issues related to the personnel of the court misses the real problem at hand, Aziz Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago, argued at the \u201cReforming The Court\u201d panel. \u201cWe are having this conversation because the court is powerful,\u201d Huq said at the New America Foundation, which was hosting the event. For that reason, he said, progressives, \u201cneed to limit the power of the court.\u201d\n\nHuq\u2019s answer is for Congress to strip the court of jurisdiction over specific issues by limiting what cases the court can hear through the Exceptions Clause. That may sound crazy \u2015 and some scholars think it is \u2015 but it\u2019s in no way unheard of in American politics. Congress has routinely increased the breadth of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction, so why can\u2019t it limit it?\n\nLimiting the Supreme Court\u2019s ability to hear cases was long a cause of populists and progressives in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The court\u2019s pro-business rulings from the Gilded Age through the Lochner-era Court in the early 20th century prompted protest from progressive lawmakers. After the court struck down a law to ban child labor \u2015 one of many such laws regulating corporate behavior struck down at the time \u2015 progressives introduced legislation to allow Congress to override Supreme Court decisions, require a supermajority vote on the court to nullify enacted laws and strip the court of jurisdiction over laws banning child labor.\n\nConservatives took up the mantle of attacking the court\u2019s power in the 1970s and 1980s by introducing bills to strip the court of the ability to hear appellate cases related to school prayer, school busing, abortion, the male-only military draft, police arrests and cases arising from state court decisions.\n\nNone of these bills ever passed. Instead, during the stretch of time from the Gilded Age all the way to the late-1980s Congress has increased the power of the Supreme Court by expanding its jurisdiction and discretion to hear cases.\n\nAdding new justices to the Supreme Court is another idea increasingly popular among those progressives angered over the Kavanaugh and Garland decisions. The Constitution does not set the number of justices in stone and the number of justices has fluctuated over the years, bumping up to 10 during the Civil War. It has been set at nine since 1869.\n\nNICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images US Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland looks at President Barack Obama after he announced his nomination in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 16, 2016.\n\nThe issue is obviously controversial as it would allow one political party to change the personnel of the court to get the partisan outcome they desire. If one party does it, then what\u2019s to stop the other party from doing the same the next time they have a chance, Sitaraman argues.\n\nBut at least one progressive push to pack the court has already begun. 1.20.21 is a public education campaign run by political scientist Aaron Belkin and backed by noted liberal Harvard Law School professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet to get progressives behind the idea of packing the court in 2021 if they have won the necessary political power to do so.\n\nBelkin, who helped organize the opposition to the Pentagon\u2019s Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell policy, wants to reverse the \u201cjudicial theft\u201d of the seat Garland was denied by having the next Democratic president appoint two new justices. The Kavanaugh seat should also be offset by two newly appointed justices in response to disastrous nomination process and failure to fully investigate the allegations of sexual assault against the judge, he says. That would bring the Supreme Court up to a total of 13 justices.\n\n\u201cThe point of the project is to unsteal the courts,\u201d Belkin said.\n\nThis argument is pretty simple and straightforward and ignores many problems that legal scholars tend to fuss over. Will it raise the political stakes? Will it bring stability to our democratic institutions? Who cares, Belkin says.\n\n\u201cTo say that Democrats shouldn\u2019t unsteal the courts because we\u2019re worried about the normative context, I think, is to ignore the very normative context that we\u2019re already in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe norms are already gone. What matters to Belkin, and one imagines a lot of Democrats, is justice.\n\nThe plan for this campaign is, in many ways, like the ongoing conservative effort to establish and maintain control of the Supreme Court. It\u2019s a public education campaign to inform progressives about the past and present conservative history of the court and keep the memory of the stolen Garland seat fresh. Grassroots progressives would then pressure their elected officials to back a plan to pack the court.\n\nDo Lawmakers Care?\n\nThese ideas and the debate around them may be percolating among progressives think tanks and online activists, but they haven\u2019t broken through yet with the most important crowd: elected lawmakers. So far, Democrats in Congress have shown little enthusiasm for these ideas, or for really any ideas about changing the Supreme Court at the moment. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he wasn\u2019t interested in impeaching Kavanaugh for his alleged lying during his confirmation hearings. And only one sitting member has openly backed adding new justices.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) is one of the few elected lawmakers openly calling for an expansion of the Supreme Court.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) says he supports adding justices to court not as justice for a stolen seat, but as part of a broader effort to stabilize the court and enable it to hear more cases. Khanna supports the addition of new justices requiring a supermajority vote of either 60 or 67 senators and the end of lifetime appointments.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you\u2019re appointed by a president and then could be influencing the nation 40 to 50 years down the line is highly counter-majoritarian,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cYou\u2019re binding future generations with little accountability to a democratic will.\u201d\n\nWhat Might Spur Action\n\nThe current Court led by chief justice John Roberts has been known for rulings rolling back progressive legislation, including the 2010 Citizens United ruling that legalized unlimited corporate spending on independent political efforts. That decision has animated progressives across the country along with the 2013 Shelby County decision overturning part of the Voting Rights Act, which similarly drew broad condemnation. But the post-Anthony Kennedy court has yet to issue a ruling, much less one that defines its perfidy to progressives. That time will come, though.\n\nCaroline Fredrickson, the ACS president, is most concerned about rulings that deal with democracy like the Shelby County and Citizens United decisions. Future rulings further limiting the Voting Rights Act, preventing states from limiting gerrymandering or gutting campaign finance laws could be easily seen as partisan attempts to help the party that appointed the five conservative justices and, thus, destroy trust in the judiciary.\n\nFor Tucker, the scholar at the Roosevelt Institute, the big worry comes from this conservative court striking down progressive legislation meant to deal with climate change.\n\n\u201cOnce you start to look at the aggressive Green New Deal policies that climate scientists say are necessary to head off these irreversible impacts over these next 10 or 20 years, that is where you\u2019re going to see the rubber hit the road,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cSome of that is going to inevitably interfere with property rights, and you have to have a court that\u2019s willing to accommodate that.\u201c\n\nAnd if the court doesn\u2019t agree, progressives will at least have started this policy discussion years earlier to help guide them towards a forward.\n\nA Switch in Time?\n\nAs progressives are discussing their path to taming the court, the debate over these proposals may be serving its own purpose, according to Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of packing the court or term limits, but I\u2019m not afraid of talking about it,\u201d Frost said.\n\nTalking about it puts political pressure on the court. That is the real lesson of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s failed attempt to pack the court in 1937, Frost argues.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s court-packing scheme is remembered as an extreme overreach of power, but the pressure it brought to bear on the court may have forced at least one justice to abandon the pro-business Lochner-era jurisprudence to uphold the minimum wage. Justice Owen Roberts\u2019 flip to the liberals on the issue of the minimum wage \u2015 \u201cthe switch in time that saved nine\u201d \u2015 is remembered as the birth of the New Deal Court which also put a nail in the coffin of Roosevelt\u2019s court-packing plan. Roberts\u2019 flip made the packing plan redundant."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "'Embedded Enemies' In Government Are Undermining Trump, Loyalists Claim: Report", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-advisers-new-book-blames-embedded-enemies-of-undermining-presidency_us_5bf9fc09e4b0771fb6b96043", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "A new book by two close associates of Donald Trump claims the presidency is being sabotaged by a network of \u201cembedded enemies\u201d throughout the federal government, The Washington Post reported Saturday.\n\nThe book, written by former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and ex-deputy manager David Bossie, repeatedly blames Trump\u2019s woes on the \u201cDeep State\u201d \u2014 the heart of a popular right-wing conspiracy theory that the federal government is secretly being manipulated by a group of officials in Congress, the White House, intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice.\n\nTrump\u2019s Enemies: How The Deep State Is Undermining The Presidency is due out Tuesday, but the Post obtained an advance copy.\n\nThe Republican operatives, who don\u2019t work in the administration, identify Trump appointees who they allege have launched a resistance movement within the White House, the Post reported.

We are seeing this unfold right now in the Ebola epidemic raging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2015 an epidemic that has been declared the worst in the country\u2019s history.\n\nTrust is the most important part of the doctor-patient relationship. I know that if I lose my patients\u2019 trust, it will be impossible for me to effectively treat them. In order to establish a trusting relationship, I must understand my patients as more than just their diseases\u2014I must understand them within the complex fabric of their social, political, religious and cultural belief systems.\n\nI do this while they are healthy, so when illness does strike they can trust me to make the right decision for them. International responders\u2019 failure to locate the DRC\u2019s current Ebola epidemic within the country\u2019s larger social, political, religious and cultural belief systems is precisely why trust was so weak when they arrived weeks ago to deploy vaccines and begin tracking the infection.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen this happen before. During the West African Ebola epidemic of 2014, a lack of community trust helped allow the virus to evolve into a pandemic, killing more than 11,000 people over two years and spreading overseas. Many international public health experts were blindsided by local community members\u2019 hesitancy and fear. West Africans went so far as to hide their funeral services from international Ebola treatment teams; funerals are now thought to be one of the most important modes of transmission between dead victims and family members later infected.\n\nMany West Africans turned to the familiar \u2014 traditional healers \u2014 rather than seeking modern medical treatment. Ultimately, anthropologists were deployed to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural nuances that needed stronger appreciation before the right interventions could be designed for specific communities. From this research, we learned that trust is the vehicle by which epidemic responses are executed effectively.\n\nYet that same lesson is catching us off-guard once again. In the North Kivu, an already awful situation is worsening, fueled by mistrust and conspiracy fears. Civilians are questioning if Ebola is possibly a political tool being used by opposition parties to alter upcoming elections. As a result, they are avoiding not just vaccinations but also testing and treatment. This means efforts at keeping track of who is infected \u2015 and vaccinating those who have come into contact with an infected individual \u2015 are failing. And the mistrust is not only directed at international responders \u2014 many locals don\u2019t trust the DRC government, either.\n\nWorse yet is that we knew this was coming. Conspiracies like these also plagued the last Ebola epidemic. In Liberia, civilians questioned if Ebola was a Western ploy to infect Africans; others wondered if Ebola was artificially created to sell vaccines to the poor.\n\nIf I was approached by a doctor with whom I didn\u2019t already have a therapeutic relationship and was told to take a pill or a shot, I\u2019d be understandably hesitant.\n\nWhen I put myself in the mind of the patient, I am not surprised by any of this. If I was approached by a doctor with whom I didn\u2019t already have a therapeutic relationship and was told to take a pill or a shot, I\u2019d be understandably hesitant. Trust must be established before \u2014 not after \u2014 a disease infects an individual or ravages a country.\n\nIf public health efforts emphasized the building of ground-level trust when communities are predominately healthy (the same way I establish rapport with my patients over many years), we\u2019d see responders and community members working together when an epidemic strikes. This would prevent a few cases from becoming hundreds or thousands.\n\nEpidemics require quick action, but we cannot cut corners when it comes to understanding a community\u2019s knowledge, attitudes and practices before employing interventions. What does the community understand about Ebola? What types of experiences are driving their belief systems? How can we best work within those systems to identify misunderstandings at their roots?\n\nFrom there, how can we work with community leaders to best teach people in a way that is culturally appropriate and locally understood? That same thoughtful approach must be taken when it comes to vaccines, diagnostics and treatment.\n\nTake vaccines, for example. U.S. physicians are very familiar with vaccine hesitancy. Almost every day, at least a handful of my patients refuse to get the flu vaccine. They often recount personal experiences in which they received the vaccine and still got sick that year. Some mistakenly believe the vaccine actually caused their flu.\n\nThis means I must take the time to explain that not every upper respiratory infection is the flu, and that the flu vaccine may very well have lessened symptoms that would have otherwise been much worse. Even then, my patients don\u2019t always agree, but we continue to have a rapport that allows me to treat them for other conditions.\n\nThe same is likely to happen with Ebola. Some patients may be amenable to vaccination, some to treatment, some to testing and some to none of these. Nonetheless, public health responders must use every opportunity to build rapport, establish trust and prove to communities that they are there in the best interests of the community\u2019s health.\n\nBuilding trust with my patients has allowed me to convince people to undergo treatments that ultimately saved their lives. This trust was earned, not given. It required me to understand my patients at a very human level, and it required me to lose many battles to ultimately win the larger war.\n\nThe same must happen with our response to epidemics. We may not convince every single person to do everything we ask, but if we can convince a community to trust that we are there because we are concerned about them as people \u2014 not just as transmitters of disease \u2014 we will begin to see a very different response."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Hospitals Are Trying To Do What Politicians Haven't: Stop Gun Violence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-violence-intervention-hospitals_us_5bc0fbade4b01a01d68aadc6", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "CHEVERLY, Md. \u2015 When Che Bullock awoke in a hospital in August 2013, the first thing he felt was grateful to be alive. He\u2019d been stabbed 13 times outside a nightclub in the Washington, D.C., area and taken by helicopter to a medical center, where doctors performed lifesaving surgery.\n\nBullock\u2019s sense of relief quickly faded, first into physical pain and anxiety, then into fear and finally into a rage toward his attackers.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like they put a hit out on me,\u201d said Bullock, now 30. He recalled friends coming to his hospital room to stand guard.\n\nJust days after the stabbing, Bullock had recovered enough to return home to the Washington neighborhood where he said he\u2019d had a beef with the individuals who\u2019d tried to kill him. Bullock was prepared to defend himself but also ready to hit back.\n\nBut before he could act, Bullock got a call from Joseph Richardson Jr., a University of Maryland associate professor, offering him an alternative. Richardson, now 50, invited him to participate in a study on young black men who had been shot or stabbed more than once \u2015 repeat victims of violence sometimes referred to as \u201cfrequent flyers.\u201d Bullock was hesitant, thinking Richardson might be working with police, but in the end he decided to sign up.\n\nThat study ultimately saved his life.\n\nGun violence is an American crisis that leads to more than 33,000 deaths each year \u2015 about a third of which are homicides \u2015 and tens of thousands more nonfatal shootings, according to federal data. Preventing that violence has been a topic of debate for decades, with politicians making glacial progress. But Richardson and others have decided to pursue another route, offering patients a glimpse into a less violent future that isn\u2019t hampered by the political stalemate.\n\nIn September 2017, Richardson launched the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program out of the Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center in Cheverly, where Bullock was treated. The program, which arose from Richardson\u2019s initial study, takes a public health approach, treating violence like a disease that can both be spread and \u201cinoculated\u201d against, said Richardson, who now serves as co-director.\n\nThomas Bacho/University of Maryland Che Bullock, left, and Joseph Richardson Jr. are helping patients find a path away from violence through their work at the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program in Maryland.\n\nThe model is the area\u2019s first hospital-based violence intervention program, or HVIP, and is one of about 30 accredited programs in the U.S., with a few more in development and a handful operating internationally.\n\nHVIPs target the structural causes of violence \u2015 many of which spring from broader racial and socioeconomic inequalities \u2015 giving survivors tools to make lifestyle changes that can prevent them from being re-victimized or from perpetrating further violence. Research shows HVIPs have been effective at reducing violent injury and death, which can lead to substantial savings on health care and criminal justice costs.\n\nRichardson\u2019s program, which also serves victims of stabbings and other traumas, has seen promising results in its first year, but it doesn\u2019t yet have enough data for a full analysis on results. Of the more than 100 patients so far enrolled, none has been re-hospitalized for violent injury, he said. Before the program\u2019s launch, one-third of all violently injured patients they saw had been hospitalized two or more times before.\n\nSave A Life And Pay It Forward\n\nBullock\u2019s road to rehabilitation began in 2013 with a simple question.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things Dr. Richardson asked me is, \u2018What do you want to do with your life?\u2019\u201d Bullock recalled of their first meeting. Richardson, at the time, was working one-on-one with some survivors, helping them find social and mental health services.\n\nBullock didn\u2019t know how to answer the question, but Richardson, who has a doctorate in criminal justice, had an idea. He invited Bullock to speak about his personal experience to an African American studies class he was teaching on the modern Jim Crow at the University of Maryland. Richardson believed Bullock\u2019s life story was important; now he just needed to persuade Bullock to share it.\n\nThe following week, Bullock headed to campus to tell his story \u2015 ending with his attack \u2015 in front of more than 100 students packed in a room.\n\n\u201cYou could drop a pin in the auditorium, I guess that\u2019s how engaged they was,\u201d Bullock said.\n\nOn the drive home, Bullock\u2019s mind raced. His presentation was a success, and the positive response from students left him considering other possibilities for his future. Perhaps he could become a motivational speaker?\n\nBut just before he got on the freeway, someone shot at his car. The bullet missed him but shattered a window, leaving him with a gash on his forearm. It had only been a few weeks since his stabbing, and Bullock once again found himself traumatized and thinking about retaliation.\n\n\u201cI even remember finding out who did it,\u201d he said.\n\nBullock called Richardson to tell him what had happened. Richardson urged Bullock to meet with him before doing anything reckless. They met again and began to discuss the factors that had led Bullock to be targeted in the first place.\n\n\u201cI started to think about how I was getting my money, what were the forces of my financial capital,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it was drugs.\u201d\n\nRichardson suggested he try something different and cut him a check for $300 to speak to his class again.\n\n\u201cI made $300 in an hour, and the hustler in me is, like, how can I turn this $300 into $1,500?\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWhen I started getting more and more speaking engagements, I really didn\u2019t think about retaliating too much because I was focused.\u201d\n\nChe Bullock Bullock and Richardson have helped more than 100 patients in the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program's first year of operation. None has been re-hospitalized for violent injury.\n\nFor the first time, Bullock saw a different path for his future. He continued to work with Richardson over the next four years, helping Richardson develop the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program. When the program launched last year, Richardson hired Bullock to recruit survivors and serve as their case manager.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk into the rooms now, the first thing I ask is, what\u2019s the plan? What do you want to do with your life?\u201d Bullock said. \u201cMost guys don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBullock meets with patients daily while they\u2019re in the hospital. When they\u2019re released, he follows up, helping to set up goals and identify needs. Bullock also works with patients to develop \u201ccoping mechanisms\u201d to manage the stress that can stem from trauma, and he urges them to get mental health treatment, which he said can be challenging because of a broader stigma in the African American community against seeking help.\n\nAfter a near-death experience, experts say there\u2019s a \u201cgolden moment\u201d in which survivors are especially receptive to guidance. Bullock builds trust and rapport with the patients and then asks them to join the program. Some turn him down, but so far the program has an enrollment rate of over 90 percent, he said.\n\nBullock also works to reach out to the friends and loved ones of survivors, which is integral to the model\u2019s success, Richardson said.\n\n\u201cIf violence is a disease and this person who was injured was infected, you\u2019re trying to inoculate this person by giving them mental health services and getting them a job, but if you\u2019re sending that person back to a network of people who are still infected, what have we really solved?\u201d he said.\n\nInvesting In Prevention\n\nIt costs about $300,000 a year to run an HVIP serving about 100 patients, said Kyle Fischer, policy director for both the Maryland program and the National Network of Hospital-based Violence Intervention Programs.\n\nThe Capital Region program has so far not had trouble securing funding for the immediate future, said program director Dawn Moreland. But with around 740 survivors of violent injury coming through the hospital each year on average, she said, additional funding could help them expand to meet the needs of the community.\n\n\u201cThe volume will always be there, unfortunately,\u201d said Moreland. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have more clients to serve.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe HVIPs are a worthy investment. Gun violence deaths and injuries cost a total of $229 billion each year, according to a 2012 study that measured direct spending on law enforcement, criminal justice and health care related to shootings, as well as indirect costs like lost wages and the effects on victims\u2019 quality of life.\n\nIn other words, the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000, according to the study.\n\nA lot of the guys tell us that this is the first time someone actually cared what happened to them. Dr. Sean Benoit, co-director of the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program\n\nBlack men account for nearly half of gun homicide victims each year, but make up only 6 percent of the population, according to a 2018 report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nThis phenomenon is often referred to as \u201cmurder inequality.\u201d But the racial disparities of gun violence are also evident in the nearly unending stream of nonfatal shootings at the hospital, said Dr. Sean Benoit, a Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center trauma surgeon and co-director of Richardson\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cThese guys come in after getting shot, we send them back out, they get shot and they come back in. So we\u2019re just patching them back up,\u201d Benoit said. \u201cWe have many patients who leave here not even knowing what surgery we did.\u201d\n\nMany survivors who find themselves at the Maryland hospital have normalized violence, seeing prison or death as acceptable or even inevitable, said Bullock.\n\nIn recent years, Benoit has made a habit of bringing his anatomy book to patients to show them how he\u2019s operated. He said it helps them understand how close they may have come to death. Small gestures like that can make huge differences, said Benoit.\n\n\u201cA lot of the guys tell us that this is the first time someone actually cared what happened to them, that this is the first time they have spoken to anyone who cares if they finish high school or get a GED or go to community college or get a job,\u201d he said.\n\nDo HVIPs Really Work?\n\nStudies indicate that HVIPs prevent violent injury, but the research has been limited in size and scope, often due to relatively small sample sizes and narrow sets of measured metrics, experts say.\n\nBut even in small studies, researchers are seeing success. By providing wraparound care to survivors, participants receive more opportunity for job placement, educational advancement, housing and even legal aid, said Rachel Myers, research coordinator of the violence intervention program at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of identifying people who have gone through this recent traumatic injury and really connecting with them in a human way,\u201d Myers said.\n\nFor survivors, just having someone believe in them can help them become productive members of society, she said.\n\nMyers, who contributed to a study on HVIP outcomes, said she\u2019d like to see future analysis that pulls from broader pools of clients and attempts to gauge how the programs are tied to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors.\n\nRichardson is also hoping to help expand the body of evidence on the effect of HVIPs. In the coming months, he said, he plans to begin the largest randomized study ever conducted on the effectiveness of HVIPs, which will include a sample of as many as 800 patients at participating programs in the Washington metro area.\n\nA New Lease On Life\n\nT.J. King, 35, grew up just a few blocks away from Bullock. He was hanging out in the neighborhood with friends in June 2017 when two men pulled up in a car and fired 56 times, striking five people, including King. All of them survived, but King\u2019s injuries were the worst. A round entered his back and came out through his chest, breaking two ribs and nearly hitting his lung and heart. After returning home from Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center, King got a call from Bullock, asking him to join an earlier iteration of the Capital Region program.\n\n\u201cI actually talked in that group about what happened to me, and how I felt and what I was going through,\u201d King said, explaining that he had never expressed himself like that before. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t tell [Bullock] this, but I went home after and cried for like two hours.\u201d\n\nJust months after King\u2019s shooting, his mother succumbed to Stage 4 cancer. King said he felt the best way to honor her was to continue improving his life. He stuck with the program and eventually got a job at Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center transporting patients. He also informally meets with survivors when Bullock is off duty. King said he hopes to join the program as a full-time employee soon.\n\nChe Bullock T.J. King, left, and Che Bullock at the Prince George's Hospital Center. Bullock helped recruit King into the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program after King was shot in 2017.\n\nNone of it has been easy, said King. It took a while to come to the realization that it wasn\u2019t worth seeking revenge against the people who shot him. King has also had to leave behind friends who weren\u2019t ready to give up the streets, he said.\n\nBut along with those changes have come a newfound positivity and passion for life. King woke up one morning a few months ago and decided he wanted to go fishing, he said. He\u2019d never fished before, but he\u2019d always been interested in it. He watched a few videos on casting and baiting, bought two fishing rods and headed to the Potomac River the next day. He caught his first fish.\n\nOver the past few months, King\u2019s love of fishing has grown. He\u2019s taught his friends how to fish, including the ones who were shot alongside him last year. Sometimes he\u2019ll take kids from the neighborhood to his favorite spots.\n\nBefore he got shot, King never thought he\u2019d be the kind of person who gets up at the crack of dawn just to sit by the water for hours, hoping for a fish to bite. Now there are fishing rods in his trunk at all times, he said, a reminder that anyone can transform their life \u2015 even if they need a little help doing it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Judge's Decision Dismissing Female Genital Mutilation Charges Sparks Concern", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judges-decision-dismissing-fgm-charges-sparks-concern-among-activists_us_5bf57f02e4b03b230f9db168", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "A federal judge has dismissed key charges against a Michigan doctor accused by prosecutors of performing female genital mutilation (FGM) on young girls \u2015 a decision that has prompted some concern among activists against the practice.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman dismissed conspiracy and mutilation charges against Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, a Detroit physician accused of performing the surgery on nine minor girls, and Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, who reportedly allowed the procedures to take place in his Livonia clinic.\n\nThe same charges were also dismissed against two women who reportedly acted as assistants during the procedure and the four mothers who prosecutors say brought their daughters to Nagarwala.\n\nOther charges levied against some of the defendants remain standing, including one accusing Nagarwala of \u201cconspiracy to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.\u201d\n\nFor Friedman, a Reagan-appointee, the dismissals on the charges of FGM came down to the issue of federalism. In his opinion, Friedman wrote that \u201cas despicable as this practice may be,\u201d FGM is a crime that should fall under the jurisdiction of states \u2015 not the federal government. He found that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it passed a federal law criminalizing FGM in 1996.\n\nBut some activists are worried about the message that the ruling will send to members of Nagarwala\u2019s religious community, Dawoodi Bohras, for whom genital cutting is still a deeply engrained tradition.\n\nMariya Tehrer is the co-founder of Sahiyo, a group that seeks to end FGM in the Bohra community. Tehrer told HuffPost that many in the Sahiyo community \u2015 particularly survivors of the practice \u2015 feel the judge\u2019s decision is \u201ca punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are sort of in shock and disbelief,\u201d Tehrer said.\n\nWatch a Love Matters India video about khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community below.\n\nThe primary concern among activists is that Bohras who support genital cutting will misinterpret the ruling as proof that the practice is permissible. But Tehrer said Friedman\u2019s ruling had to do with a jurisdictional and technical challenge, pointing out that in his opinion, the judge called the practice of genital cutting \u201cessentially a criminal assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication is that he views this as a criminal activity, but a local criminal activity under state jurisdiction,\u201d Tehrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important distinction, but the reality is that many people have been using it as proof that we can continue this. That\u2019s not at all what happened.\u201d\n\nThe government is reviewing Friedman\u2019s opinion, The Associated Press reports. Experts are expecting it to be appealed.\n\nThe Nagarwala case is believed to be the first brought under the federal law against FGM, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. Only 27 states currently have laws criminalizing FGM.\n\nNagarwala, a former emergency room physician, was arrested in April 2017, after an FBI investigation uncovered that she allegedly removed clitoral skin from two 7-year-old girls. Prosecutors claimed the girls were brought from Minnesota to Livonia for the procedure.\n\nThe investigation eventually uncovered nine alleged victims of FGM.\n\nMichigan\u2019s law against FGM passed after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest and can\u2019t be used to retroactively charge the doctor or others involved in the case, the Detroit Free Press reports.\n\nShannon Smith, Nagarwala\u2019s lawyer, has maintained that the procedure the doctor performed does not qualify as FGM.\n\n\u201cDr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\u201d Smith told the Detroit Free Press after the ruling. \u201cThe whole community was shocked when this happened. She\u2019s always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is primarily a cultural tradition that is practiced by some members of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other faiths, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nMost American Muslim denominations do not practice FGM. In fact, prominent Muslim organizations have openly condemned the practice. But for years, Dawoodi Bohras, a Mumbai-based sect of Shia Islam, have practiced a type of genital cutting called khatna, or khafz. Bohras have long considered khatna to be a religious requirement for women, even though it is rarely discussed by mosque leaders. The social pressure to have daughters undergo the procedure has been quietly passed down from woman to woman over generations.\n\nSupporters of khatna resist having their practice defined as FGM. But Tahrer said although the kind of genital cutting typically practiced by Bohras is not as extreme as other forms, it is still happening to young girls who are not able to give their consent.\n\nIn addition, calling khatna simply a \u201cnick\u201d or a \u201cwiping\u201d of the clitoral hood also dismisses the stories of many survivors who say they are still experiencing physical or emotional harm from the procedure, Tahrer said.\n\nThe WHO and The United Nations Population Fund consider genital cutting to be a human rights violation \u2015 no matter the severity of the particular procedure.\n\nCourtesy of Sahiyo Sahiyo cofounders in Mumbai India displaying an award the organization received for their work on female genital cutting.\n\nBoth Bohra men and women have spoken up against khatna in recent years.

There, a meeting was planned with the local county governor, or bupati, to discuss a similar situation.\n\nNorth of Sintang, a grim commercial town of concrete and rebar at a fork in the Kapuas River, two palm plantations were being developed on peatland bogs. These plantations, too, were located on tracts that Indonesian government maps had at one time explicitly labeled protected peatland, which should have placed them under the moratorium on palm development. The maps had since been changed. Yet there was no mistaking that this was peatland: Paths submerged into black goop, teams of dragonflies swarmed over the hot water, reeds and forest grew from their depths. And here came a flatbed truck, carrying an excavator toward the entrance gate, where a guard in a neatly pressed dark blue uniform turned away visitors.\n\nThe permits named two obscure companies, but a villager at the gate told us that he thought both plantations were run by the same company and that it had been clearing the forest for months. It\u2019s not uncommon for Indonesian companies to use layers of subsidiaries to hide their connections to illegal palm operations. \u201cWe call them shadow companies,\u201d said Eric Wakker, a founder of Aidenvironment Asia, an environmental consultancy that has investigated the two plantations. Upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the two companies may indeed have been linked to the Salim Group. They shared a business address with a Salim subsidiary in Jakarta and employed the same plantation managers in Kalimantan. Salim was also a buyer of the palm that would come from the Sintang plantations.\n\nThe connection matters because the Salim Group has benefited from more than $1.5 billion in loans and capital from foreign investors, including the American firms BlackRock and Vanguard, and Salim companies have pledged that their palm oil is not a product of recent deforestation or peatland destruction. Satellite images from 2017 confirmed that the forests on the Sintang plantations were now virtually gone. (A Salim Group executive, Mark Wakeford, declined to comment about the Sintang companies.)\n\nAt the bupati\u2019s house, an elegant, 19th-century Dutch-built compound bursting with tropical flowers, I pressed him to explain how these peatland forests could be cut down when the government insisted that such land clearing had stopped. The bupati, a doctor named Jarot, had moved to Borneo from Java and had developed a local reputation as a conservationist. He greeted us jovially, barefoot and dressed in bluejeans and a crisp, untucked blue button-down shirt. He said the rural districts must balance economic growth with sustainability, and while he has pledged to control corruption and illegal permits, he also described himself as helpless against the currents of a central government that is close to the big corporations and constantly changes both the rules and the playing field. United Nations forest programs pay communities to leave their trees in the ground. Such funding would help him strike a better balance here, he said, casually shrugging off the plantation case I asked about. \u201cWe do what we can do,\u201d Jarot said. \u201cWe cannot do it by ourselves. ... We need a fiscal incentive.\u201d\n\nAn aide offered a more nuanced explanation. The phrases \u201cpeatland\u201d and \u201cforest\u201d have distinct legal meanings in Indonesia, he claimed; not all treed areas are forests, and not all peat-filled bogs are peatland. In the strictest legal sense, he was correct. The Sintang regency alone, according to Indonesian government estimates, contains more than 160,000 acres of old-growth, heavily treed land that it has not designated as \u201cforest\u201d under the law and more than 86,000 acres of nondesignated peatland. After a request from the companies, the government maps for Sintang were revised to change the peatland borders. New maps show the bog boundaries tracing perfect 90-degree angles and straight lines \u2014 lines that happen to match the boundaries of the companies\u2019 land holdings. How do you account for such details in a life-cycle analysis?\n\n7. \u2018It Was a Mistake\u2019\n\nThis September, with late-season heat pounding Washington, Zenzi Suhadi cleared security at the Russell Senate Office Building, preparing to brief Senate aides about the impact that palm-oil development was having on Indonesia\u2019s environment. I asked if he was nervous, and he said no. \u201cThese are just people. I don\u2019t have to face any tigers.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to be joking."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "U.S. Climate Report Warns of Damaged Environment and Shrinking Economy", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/climate/us-climate-report.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "But the new report also emphasizes that the outcomes depend on how swiftly and decisively the United States and other countries take action to mitigate global warming. The authors put forth three main solutions: putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions, which usually means imposing taxes or fees on companies that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; establishing government regulations on how much greenhouse pollution can be emitted; and spending public money on clean-energy research.\n\nA White House statement said the report, which was started under the Obama administration, was \u201clargely based on the most extreme scenario\u201d of global warming and that the next assessment would provide an opportunity for greater balance.\n\nThe report covers every region of the United States and asserts that recent climate-related events are signs of things to come. No area of the country will be untouched, from the Southwest, where droughts will curb hydropower and tax already limited water supplies, to Alaska, where the loss of sea ice will cause coastal flooding and erosion and force communities to relocate, to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where saltwater will taint drinking water.\n\nMore people will die as heat waves become more common, the scientists say, and a hotter climate will also lead to more outbreaks of disease.\n\nTwo areas of impact particularly stand out: trade and agriculture.\n\nTrade disruptions\n\nMr. Trump has put trade issues at the center of his economic agenda, placing new tariffs on imports and renegotiating trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The biometric screening failed even for Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah when they cast their ballots on Election Day. Thousands of the biometric devices \u2014 and their data \u2014 have yet to be returned to election headquarters in Kabul, officials said.\n\nThere has also been criticism of the devices\u2019 potential to identify voters and how they voted.\n\nThose and other technical problems have greatly delayed the counting of votes: Five weeks later, results have been announced for only five of 33 provinces where voting took place. Estimates are that final results may not be ready until well into January \u2014 leaving barely three months to prepare for the next elections."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "title": "Judge Rejects George Papadopoulos\u2019s Motions to Delay Prison Sentence", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/george-papadopoulos-trump-mueller-jail.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-25 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "A federal judge on Sunday denied attempts by the former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos to delay the start of his two-week prison sentence, slated to begin on Monday.\n\nMr. Papadopoulos was sentenced in September for lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential race, lies that prosecutors said hampered the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in that election.\n\nIn a 13-page opinion, Judge Randolph D.
