Cindy Hyde-Smith was expected to coast to victory in a Mississippi runoff that would conclude the last Senate race of 2018's midterm elections.\n\nInstead, Hyde-Smith has spent the days leading up to Tuesday's election mired in controversy that evoked the state's dark history of racism and slavery.\n\nIt began when video emerged online of her telling supporters earlier this month that she'd be \"on the front row\" if one of her supporters there \"invited me to a public hanging.\" She later called the comments an \"exaggerated expression of regard,\" but her use of the phrase \"public hanging\" brought memories of Mississippi's history of lynchings to the forefront and put the contest under the national microscope.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mississippi voters will decide between Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, who, if elected, would be the state's first black senator since Reconstruction.\n\nThe result will finalize the balance of power in the US Senate. As it stands, Republicans will hold 52 seats next year, and Democrats will have 47. A win for the GOP in Mississippi would further pad the party's majority in the Senate, even as Democrats have taken a solid majority in the House.\n\nThe state is polarized along racial lines, with most white voters backing Republicans and nearly all black voters supporting Democrats.\n\nDemocrats hope Hyde-Smith's comments will lead to a surge in black turnout and propel them to victory. However, even if black voters, who make up nearly 40% of the state's electorate, come out in full force, Espy would still have to outperform his party's history with whites to have a chance of winning.\n\nAnd Democrats have to overcome partisan trends in the deeply red state. Earlier this month, when multiple candidates in both parties were on the ballot, Hyde-Smith and conservative Chris McDaniel combined for 58% of the vote, while Espy and Democrat Tobey Bartee got 42%.\n\nOn the eve of the election, President Donald Trump held two rallies for Hyde-Smith in an attempt to turn out the Republican base.\n\nHe told the crowd in Tupelo to \"get out\" and vote in Tuesday's runoff.\n\n\"I think it'll be a very big day for Cindy, but don't take any chances,\" he said. \"That's happened many times before. That never works out well. Just assume you have to vote.\"\n\nEven though Republicans will control the Senate regardless of the outcome, the President suggested that a Democratic win in Mississippi would \"revoke\" the party's victories.\n\n\"We cannot allow Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to revoke that victory by winning the state of Mississippi,\" he said.\n\nAt a roundtable in Gulfport, Trump called Hyde-Smith's comments about a public hanging \"sad and a little flip.\"\n\n\"When I spoke to her -- she called me -- she said, 'I said something that I meant exactly very different,' and I heard an apology loud and clear,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I know where her heart is, and her heart is good. That's not what she was meaning when she said that,\" he said.\n\nHyde-Smith at center of controversy\n\nThough public polling has been limited, the race is seen as potentially competitive because of Hyde-Smith's \"public hanging\" remarks.\n\nThose comments prompted deeper dives into her history.\n\nThe same progressive blogger who published the video of her using the phrase \"public hanging\" later published one in which Hyde-Smith told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \"a great thing.\" Her campaign said it was a joke, but that explanation backfired when the black student from the event seen laughing in a picture her campaign posted on Twitter responded that Hyde-Smith's campaign was using him as a prop.\n\nOn Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith had attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate public schools. Hyde-Smith's daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press. The senator's campaign responded to the report by attacking the \"liberal media.\"\n\nOver the weekend, CNN reported that Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier's effort to \"defend his homeland\" and had pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War.\n\nIn photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The caption on the post read, \"Mississippi history at its best!\"\n\nEspy's campaign hammered Hyde-Smith with television ads that cast her as an embarrassment to a state that has attempted to overcome its history of slavery and racism.\n\n\"We've worked hard to overcome the stereotypes that hurt our economy and cost us jobs. Her words should not reflect Mississippi's values, either,\" a narrator said in one ad. The ad also called Hyde-Smith \"so embarrassing, she'd be a disaster for Mississippi.\"\n\nSeveral companies that had donated to Hyde-Smith's campaign, including Walmart, publicly withdrew their support for the senator over the \"public hanging\" comment.\n\nIn her debate with Espy, Hyde-Smith said she would \"certainly apologize\" to anyone who was offended by her remark. But she quickly pivoted into attack mode.\n\n\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" she said.\n\nGOP fights to avoid embarrassment\n\nThe controversies surrounding Hyde-Smith set off a major push by national Republicans to avoid the same embarrassment they'd suffered last year in Alabama and save Hyde-Smith.\n\nWhile Hyde-Smith largely stayed off the campaign trail, the party's infrastructure rallied to her defense. GOP groups spent $4 million on the Mississippi runoff -- much more than Democrats' $1.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Republican groups spent more than twice as much as Democrats on television advertisements, per the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.\n\nTrump's visits to Mississippi on Monday night were also seen as bid to rally the Republican base to vote in an election taking place two days after the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nFor Democrats, the best-case scenario is similar to how Democratic Sen. Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore in Alabama a year ago: a narrow victory fueled by massive turnout from black voters.\n\nBut Mississippi is, in some ways, more challenging than Alabama. Moore faced allegations that, as an adult, he had sought sexual relationships with teenage girls.\n\nAnd the state is more rural than its eastern neighbor. Like Alabama, Mississippi hasn't voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Trump won Mississippi by 18 percentage points in 2016."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: Civil War ghosts haunt the Mississippi runoff vote", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Qn5z5RJhgYA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst and anchor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Every Southerner knows the truth of William Faulkner's words: \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\"\n\nHistory hangs over Southern politics with a heaviness less known in the North. While it is a lazy northern stereotype to dismiss the South as irredeemably racist, the legacy of slavery, the Civil War and segregation plays a disproportionate role in Southern politics.\n\nJust take a look at the high-stakes Senate runoff occurring Tuesday and a far less noticed but almost equally impactful judicial nomination to fill a lifetime federal court seat in North Carolina.\n\nLet's start with the biggest federal race left in the nation, the Mississippi senate runoff between incumbent Republican senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and former Democratic congressman and Clinton agriculture secretary Mike Espy. First, a reality check: Mississippi hasn't sent a Democrat to the US Senate since the 1980s. Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by an almost 18-point margin in 2016.\n\nBut after Doug Jones shocked the world with his Senate win over Roy Moore in Alabama all things seem possible, if not likely. CNN's Harry Enten estimates that Espy will need to pull more than 23% of the white vote and see record African-American turnout to pull out a win.\n\nGiven that Espy would be the first African-American senator from the state since Reconstruction, the second half of that requirement does not seem like mission impossible. But the need for a historically large chunk of the white vote reveals the ghost of the Civil War that huddles in the wings of the Senate race. And Senator Hyde-Smith keeps bringing the subject back by her words and actions.\n\nThe first incident in this primary was in the form of an odd joke that doesn't travel for good reason: the senator made a comment about be willing to take a front row seat at a \"public hanging\" if one of her prominent supporters invited her. Lynching humor isn't really a thing for obvious reasons and the fact that this phrase slipped off her tongue speaks to the way the darkest legacies of the South can endure in phrases that white folks say without thinking.\n\nMore culpable to my mind was the social media post the senator made after visiting the home of the traitorous Confederate President Jefferson Davis, wearing a confederate cap and calling it \"Mississippi history at its best.\" This is a good example of the \"heritage not hate\" argument you often hear in the South -- but the truth is that it can be both.\n\nThis was not just a moment of historic enthusiasm on Hyde-Smith's part. CNN's K-File found that she sponsored a resolution to honor the last living daughter of a Confederate soldier in what she called \"the War Between the States,\" while the Washington Post found she'd sponsored a resolution to re-name a road the \"Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway.\"\n\nThis is perhaps a reflection of the culture Hyde-Smith grew up in: the Jackson Free Press found she'd attended a so-called \"segregation academy\" in the 1970s -- a private all-white school established as part of so called \"massive resistance\" to desegregation championed by white citizens councils at the time.\n\nAll of this is just more evidence of why it's important to learn our history and use it to impose perspective on our political judgments today.\n\nThat's also why debates over judicial nominations can matter beyond simple questions of filling a vacancy. You probably haven't heard the name Thomas Farr, but he's a North Carolina lawyer who's been nominated to fill the longest open court seat in our country. So why is this controversial?\n\nFarr cut his teeth working on the campaign of North Carolina's notorious Jesse Helms -- a conservative who crusaded against civil rights legislation. More recently he served as a lawyer representing North Carolina's attempts to roll back voting rights through the use of Voter ID (which the Richmond-based 4th Circuit said impacted African-American voters with \"almost surgical precision.\")\n\nPerhaps most troubling, Farr represented the North Carolina state legislature in putting forward a racial gerrymandered map which had key elements struck down by the US Supreme Court.\n\nWith the Senate narrowly divided -- and Obama's African-American nominees for the seat never brought up for a vote -- all eyes will be on South Carolina's Tim Scott to see whether Farr's record on voting rights represents a serious concern for the Palmetto state's conservative, African-American senator.\n\nWhile Tim Scott is the first African-American from a Southern state to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction, it's worth noting that South Carolina posited a more diverse statewide elected slate when he and then-Gov. Nikki Haley served in office than most liberal northern states.\n\nHistory casts a long shadow and can shape culture in ways that aren't always apparent to residents of a particular state. But the stereotypes often break down upon closer inspection. The culture of the country doesn't entirely change when you drive from a red state to a blue state.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn fact, it might amaze some casual political observers to know that Hillary Clinton won the counties where there are big cities in Southern states like North Carolina (Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Greensboro), South Carolina (Charleston and Columbia), Tennessee (Nashville and Memphis) and Alabama (Birmingham and Montgomery). Obviously, Trump won all these states. But it's evidence that the larger cultural divisions in our country are not red state versus blue state as much as urban versus rural. And according to CNN's Enten, Democrats gained 5% in their percentage of the vote in urban and suburban areas of the Deep South in the 2018 midterms compared to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNone of this means that Mike Espy should be considered a likely victor in Tuesday's Mississippi runoff. But the mere fact of a competitive Senate election between an African-American Democrat and a female Republican is a sign of civic progress that defies stereotypes and marks progress toward rebuking some of the ugliest aspects of our shared history."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Photo surfaces of senator with Confederate artifacts", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/sLzliFmDT3g/cindy-hyde-smith-mississippi-confederate-artifacts-dnt-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Mississippi Sen.

Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi accused Democrats at a debate Tuesday night of weaponizing her recent remark about attending a \"public hanging\" at the invitation of a local rancher.\n\nThe comment, which was captured on tape and quickly went viral, called up dark memories of lynchings in the state. Asked about it by a moderator, Hyde-Smith said she would \"certainly apologize\" to anyone who was offended, but then pivoted to an attack on her opponent, Democrat Mike Espy, a former congressman and US agriculture secretary running to become the state's first African-American senator since Reconstruction.\n\n\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" Hyde-Smith said. \"A political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That's the type of politics Mississippians are sick and tired of.\"\n\nHyde-Smith set off the furor earlier this month when, at a campaign event in Tupelo, she used what her campaign has since dismissed in a statement as \"an exaggerated expression of regard.\"\n\n\"If he invited me to a public hanging,\" she said of the man, \"I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, inside a small television studio with no live audience, Espy rejected Hyde-Smith's claim that her words had been taken out of context.\n\n\"I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth,\" Espy said, before channeling the message he put out in an ad earlier in the day. \"It's caused our state harm. It's given our state another black eye that we don't need. It's just rejuvenated old stereotypes that we don't need anymore.\"\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy will face off next week, on November 27, in a runoff for the Mississippi US Senate seat she was appointed to earlier this year.\n\nGiven the chance to rebut Espy, Hyde-Smith repeated her earlier response almost to the word, saying, \"My comments were taken and twisted and used as a political weapon against me by my opponent. That is just wrong. It is unfortunate, and that's the type of politics Mississipians are tired of.\"\n\nHyde-Smith's \"public hanging\" riff and a subsequent tape, which showed her joking -- as her campaign put it -- about suppressing the votes of students at liberal colleges, have triggered a backlash among Democrats nationwide and more recently from large corporations like Walmart, which on Tuesday withdrew its support for her campaign and asked for its donations to be returned.\n\nA recent filing with the Federal Election Commission showed Walmart had given Hyde-Smith's campaign $2,000.\n\n\"Sen. Hyde-Smith's recent (hanging) comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates,\" Walmart said on Twitter. \"As a result, we are withdrawing our support and requesting a refund of all campaign donations.\"\n\nGoogle, which gave Hyde-Smith $5,000, backed away from the freshman senator last week.\n\n\"This contribution was made on Nov. 2 before Sen. Hyde-Smith's (hanging) remarks became public on Nov. 11,\" the company said in a statement. \"While we support candidates who promote pro-growth policies for business and technology, we do not condone these remarks and would have not made such a contribution had we known about them.\"\n\nUnion Pacific and Boston Scientific also defended their initial decisions to give, saying on social media that they had made their donations before the \"public hanging\" video become public, but requested that they be returned.\n\nIt is not clear whether Hyde-Smith has agreed to recoup the donations. Her campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Monday, Hyde-Smith returned a $2,700 donation from a Seattle businessman, Peter Zieve, whose company, Electroimpact, was sued by Washington state for discriminating against Muslims.\n\nBut the comment that first got the country's attention took place at a campaign event alongside a cattle rancher she described on Tuesday as \"a supporter who has a big piece of my heart.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night, she compared the \"hanging\" comment to another she had made about the same person, saying, \"To express my deep regard for and my sincere commitment to this young man, I used a phrase: I told him would fight a circle saw off for him.\"\n\n\"Well, obviously I would not stick my arm in a circle saw,\" she said, explaining her rhetorical exaggeration and comparing it to her comment about public hanging. \"Nor did any of my comments ever mean I would enjoy any type of capital punishment sitting there witnessing this.\"\n\nIn a new ad released Tuesday, Espy warned Mississippi voters -- much as he did during their debate -- that electing Hyde-Smith would reinforce \"the stereotypes that hurt our state.\"\n\n\"We can't afford a senator who embarrasses us and reinforces the stereotypes we've worked so hard to overcome,\" a narrators says. \"We're better than this, Mississippi -- and that's no joke.\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have campaigned for Espy in Mississippi in recent days. On Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden announced his endorsement of Espy, while others, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have sent out fundraising emails.\n\nHyde-Smith, whose Mississippi colleague Sen. Roger Wicker won re-election earlier this month by nearly 20 percentage points, has run into an assortment of self-made roadblocks during the runoff campaign.\n\nPhotographs from 2014 of Hyde-Smith posing with Confederate artifacts also surfaced on Tuesday, another headache for her campaign a week out from the runoff election.\n\nShe posted one image with a caption -- \"Mississippi history at its best!\" -- after touring the home and library of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In the same post, Hyde-Smith appears in four additional photos with Confederate rifles, soldiers' hats and documents.\n\nSome Democrats believe Espy is now within striking distance of flipping a Senate seat in a state that President Donald Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. Trump is scheduled to lead a pair of rallies, in Biloxi and Tupelo, for Hyde-Smith on the day before the election.\n\nHyde-Smith began the debate by plugging Trump's planned appearances, using her opening statement to thank him for coming.\n\n\"The President of the United States is coming to Mississippi to campaign on my behalf,\" she said before ticking off the dates, times and locations of his rallies.\n\nEspy, following the lead of other successful Democrats in 2018, pledged to cut an independent figure in Washington if elected and he attacked the state's Republican leadership for turning down Medicaid expansion funding under Obamacare.\n\n\"That's why now we have all these rural hospitals in Mississippi closing,\" he said, \"because we did not accept the Medicaid expansion money and we have uncompensated care.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Nooses found at Mississippi state Capitol one day before the special election", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/irXwy1Rp4S0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Mississippi Department of Public Safety is looking for several suspects believed responsible for placing a pair of nooses and signs on the Mississippi state Capitol grounds Monday morning.\n\nThe items were placed the day before a runoff election between Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith and former Democratic congressman Mike Espy for a US Senate seat.

Kramer has them because his company sued Facebook and accused the social media giant of having a disregard for user privacy. Six4Three also claimed that Zuckerberg devised a plan that forced some of Facebook's rivals, or potential rivals, out of business.\n\nFacebook had fought for months to keep the documents from being made public. It's now possible that their contents could be revealed during the committee's hearing this week.\n\nIn Monday's court filing, Kramer's lawyers claimed that during a recent trip to London, he resisted demands from UK lawmaker Damian Collins that he give Collins the documents. But Kramer eventually \"panicked\" after a UK official showed up at his hotel room and ordered him to surrender the documents, the filing says.\n\nFacebook and Six4Three declined to comment. Collins, who heads the committee investigating Facebook, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHow the documents ended up in the United Kingdom\n\nKramer's story begins with Carole Cadwalladr, a reporter for The Guardian who has covered Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. His attorneys suggested in Monday's court filing that she somehow tipped off members of the UK parliament to Kramer's movements so they would know when he was in the country.\n\nAccording to the court filing, Cadwalladr told Kramer in August \"that she would like to raise Six4Three's case with Damian Collins.\" A few months later, Collins told Kramer that Cadwalladr told him about the Facebook-related documents in Kramer's possession.\n\nAt the time, Kramer told Collins that he couldn't hand over the documents because they were under seal in California, the filing says.\n\nThings escalated earlier this month. Kramer told Cadwalladr that he was taking a business trip to London. According to Monday's filing, the reporter suggested that they meet to talk about the case. Kramer agreed and gave her the address of his hotel.\n\nOnce he arrived, Kramer received an email from Collins and his committee that demanded he produce the documents. The court filing says he declined, citing the California order sealing them.\n\nThat back-and-forth culminated in a visit to Kramer's hotel last Wednesday by the Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, according to the court filing. Kramer's attorneys claim the Serjeant-at-Arms served him with an order demanding that he produce the documents.\n\nThe attorneys say their client \"does not know how\" the committee discovered where he was staying and that the only person he told about the location of his hotel was Cadwalladr.\n\nMonday's court filing does not provide any evidence that Collins learned any information about Kramer's visit from Cadwalladr.\n\nCadwalladr declined to comment for this article.\n\nAfter the hotel visit, Kramer received another email from the committee which threatened to hold him in contempt of Parliament, according to the court filing. Fearing that he'd be barred from leaving the country, he eventually went to Parliament to meet with Collins without telling his lawyers.\n\nThe filing claims that Collins and his staff kept Kramer \"for two hours\" and told him \"that he was under an active investigation, that he was now in contempt of Parliament, and that the penalty could include fines and potential imprisonment.\"\n\n\"At this point, Mr. Kramer panicked,\" the filing says. Kramer downloaded the documents to a USB drive and handed them over to the committee.\n\nThe court filing notes that neither Kramer's company nor its lawyers \"condones or approves of the manner in which Mr. Kramer resolved that dilemma.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nCollins said the committee is reviewing the documents \u2014 which he has called \"clearly of significant interest to the committee's inquiry\" \u2014 so it can decide how to proceed.\n\nThe committee is holding an unprecedented meeting Tuesday during which it will question witnesses on so-called \"fake news\" and disinformation. The meeting will feature representatives from nine countries and will take place in London. An executive from Facebook is scheduled to attend\n\nThe documents could be made public during the hearing. Members of the UK Parliament have \"parliamentary privilege,\" which gives them a great deal of leeway to discuss issues without legal ramifications.\n\nFacebook is also expected to file a brief about the consequences of Collins' having demanded the documents from Kramer, despite the US court order prohibiting their release, including what issues it may raise under the US Constitution.\n\nEarlier this year, CNN filed jointly with The Guardian a motion in the California court asking for the documents to be unsealed. That motion was not successful.

Officials there also refused to comment.\n\n'Threw a fit'\n\nThe reason for the delay continues to be a White House worry about angering Saudi Arabia, which strongly opposes the resolution, multiple sources say. CNN reported earlier this month that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, \"threw a fit\" when presented with an early draft of the document, leading to a delay and further discussions among Western allies on the matter.\n\nSources say US concerns, which are shared by other nations -- including the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, both of which support Saudi in the conflict -- hinge on the real possibility that if the Security Council resolution is voted through, Saudi Arabia or the Houthis, or both, won't show up for hoped-for talks that are expected to take place next month in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThis latest delay comes a week after President Donald Trump indicated that he will not take strong action against Saudi Arabia or the crown prince for the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will brief lawmakers about the Khashoggi killing on Wednesday.\n\nThe move to slow the resolution could increase tensions with lawmakers from both parties who have expressed deep reservations about US support for the kingdom's war in Yemen and would like to censure Saudi Arabia for what its officials admit was a premeditated murder.\n\nAnd it will continue to fuel questions about Trump's unusual deference to the kingdom.\n\nJUST WATCHED Houthis ready for Yemen ceasefire, leader says Replay More Videos ...

And (the crown prince) brings a whole new level of paranoia about this.\"\n\nThe situation in Yemen is now viewed as the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet, with some 13 million Yemenis at risk of starving to death, according to the United Nations and human rights groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, five human rights groups had issued an unusually stark statement, saying the US will bear shared responsibility for what may be the largest famine in decades if it doesn't cease support for the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nSave the Children said Wednesday that an estimated 85,000 children under the age of 5 may have died from extreme hunger or disease since the war began.\n\nBut one source says that any language on human rights or accountability should not be expected in the UN resolution, as that would be \"unwelcome to the coalition\" fighting the Houthis.\n\nThe source told CNN that the crafters of the draft resolution know it is unbalanced in its criticism solely of the Houthis, but \"we are faced with a very stubborn set of allies. When you see this resolution not being critical of Saudis, some of that is because if they feel the entire world is against them, they'll continue this war.\"\n\nThe conflict, which began in 2015 as a civil war after the ouster of a strongman leader, gathered force when Saudi Arabia and allies entered the battle to counter what they saw as Iranian influence. The Gulf coalition received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France, which have also been selling weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter nearly four years, the war has killed around 57,000 people, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a crisis mapping project."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Ukraine approves martial law as Russia tensions escalate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/sSCJsgnD_1k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Moscow (CNN) Ukrainian lawmakers on Monday voted to introduce martial law in the border areas with Russia after it seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in a key waterway that holds strategic importance for both countries.\n\nIt's the first time Ukraine has enacted martial law since the conflict with Russia began in 2014, indicating a major escalation in tensions between the two former Soviet Republics.\n\nThe law -- which could give the government extraordinary powers over civil society -- will start on November 28 and will last 30 days. In Parliament, 276 members voted for the motion.\n\nUkranian MPs speaking ahead of a parliamentary vote on whether to impose martial law in the country.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said martial law would be introduced only in regions bordering Russia, or adjacent to regions where Russian troops are posted. That includes regions bordering the Azov and Black Seas and a portion of the border with Moldova's Transnistria region, where Russian troops are stationed.\n\n\"This is where the blow can be struck,\" Poroshenko said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government's introduction of martial law follows a confrontation with Russia Sunday around a waterway linking the Azov Sea and the Black Sea.\n\nUkraine said two of its small gunboats and one tugboat were attacked by Russian naval forces Sunday after entering the Kerch Strait en route to the city of Mariupol.\n\nVideo of the incident released by Ukrainian officials appeared to show a Russian ship ramming the Ukrainian tugboat.\n\nThe incident provoked fury in Kiev, while Russia accused Ukraine of acting as the aggressor, calling the incident a \"dangerous provocation\" by Kiev.\n\nDuring an emergency UN Security Council meeting to defuse rising tensions after Sunday's confrontation, US Ambassador Nikki Haley called the incident \"yet another reckless Russian escalation\" and demanded that the Kremlin release the sailors.\n\n\"This is no way for a law-abiding, civilized nation to act,\" Haley said, adding that it was an \"outrageous violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n\"Impeding Ukraine's lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law. It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept.\"\n\nUS Ambassador to the United Nation Nikki Haley addresses the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday called for restraint by Ukraine and Russia following the incident.\n\n\"The United States condemns this aggressive Russian action. We call on Russia to return to Ukraine its vessels and detained crew members, and to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters,\" he said in a statement.\n\nUkraine's navy said six of its sailors were injured in the incident on Sunday. It added that the tugboat and one of the gunboats were disabled and towed away by the Russian navy. The other gunboat was undamaged but was also seized by Russia, Ukraine said.\n\nOn Monday, Russia's state news agency RIA reported that all 24 sailors aboard the three boats were detained by Russia, citing sources in Crimea's security agencies. Three of the sailors were now in a hospital, it added.\n\nThe Kerch Strait -- a shallow, narrow stretch of water just 2 to 3 miles wide at one point -- connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea.\n\nIt's also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, a peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait was opened in May.\n\nRussia has 'no justification' says NATO\n\nAhead of an extraordinary meeting of NATO-Ukraine ambassadors in Brussels late Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia had \"no justification\" for seizing the Ukrainian ships.\n\n\"What we saw yesterday was very serious because we actually saw Russia use military force against Ukraine in an open and direct way,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that NATO has increased its presence in the black sea region. \"We have to show Russia that its actions have consequences.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Stoltenberg pledged the alliance's \"full support for Ukraine's territorial integrity\" following a morning phone call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nSimilarly, European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic condemned Russia at a press briefing on Monday. She called on Russia to \"immediately release the vessels and the crew.\"\n\nEuropean member states of the UN Security Council -- including France, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the UK -- also called on Russia to restore freedom of passage at the Kerch Strait, in a statement.\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the incident as a \"dangerous provocation\" by Kiev that required \"special attention and special investigation,\" the state news agency TASS reported.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been locked in long-simmering conflict since the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and a war with Russian-backed separatists in the country's east has claimed more than 10,000 lives.\n\nProtesters gather outside the Russian embassy in Kiev on Sunday evening.\n\nWhat happened\n\nUkraine and Russia offered conflicting accounts of the incident, each accusing the other of violating the laws of the sea. A 2003 agreement confirms the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait as domestic waters of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service (FSB) Border Service in Crimea reported that three Ukrainian warships had illegally entered Russia's territorial waters and were carrying out dangerous maneuvers, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nTASS reported the three Ukrainian vessels were detained by Russian forces and that \"weapons were used to force them to stop.\"\n\n\"They did not respond to legitimate demands by the ships and boats of Russia's FSB Border Guard Service escorting them to stop immediately and performed dangerous maneuvers,\" the FSB said, according to TASS.\n\nThree Ukrainian servicemen were wounded and received medical care from the Russians, TASS said.\n\nThe Ukrainian navy, on the other hand, said Russian border patrol vessels \"carried out openly aggressive action\" against the Ukrainian ships.\n\nPresident Poroshenko's office described the Russian action against the Ukrainian navy ships as \"an act of aggression aimed at deliberately escalating the situation in the waters of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait,\" and called for international condemnation of Moscow and the imposition of new sanctions.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov also tweeted video he claims shows the two ships colliding.\n\nThe video appears to be shot from on board a Russian vessel. A commander can be heard speaking Russian, swearing and ordering his crew to \"slam him from the right,\" \"squeeze him\" and finally warning those on board to \"hold on\" before the moment of impact.\n\nIt's unclear how Avakov obtained the video.

What happened next would rock his family.\n\nSmith, 41, was shot multiple times by an alleged burglar running from officers, police said. He spent the next eight days in a hospital, his wife said, dying on Thanksgiving day.\n\nThe incident began November 14 in Barstow, a city 115 miles northeast of Los Angeles, when police received a call about a burglary, according to a news release from the Barstow Police Department. The caller said their neighbor's home was being broken into and that flashlights could be seen inside the neighbor's home. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Smith said, a different neighbor called their house because she heard noises outside.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they chased two teenage boys on foot to the back of the burglarized home and lost sight of them.

Evidence technicians confirmed the handgun found by the officers matched the caliber of the shell casings found at the scene of the shooting, police said.\n\nFour teenage boys, ages 15 to 17, were arrested at the scene.

The couple are huge Pittsburgh Steelers fans, she said. So when the Steelers were playing the Jacksonville Jaguars that Sunday, she knew she had to find a way to download a game and invite family over.\n\nElizabeth Smith streamed the Pittsburgh Steelers-Jacksonville Jaguars game for her husband, Patrick Smith, while he was in the hospital.\n\n\"We were able to have a Steelers game party,\" she said.\n\nThe group ended up watching the game on Elizabeth's laptop in Smith's hospital room, she said.\n\n\"He told me days later that it was one of the greatest things,\" she said. \"He was really looking forward to watching the Steelers-Broncos game\" on Sunday.\n\nBut things took an unexpected turn. The night before Thanksgiving, Elizabeth Smith said, she and her husband stayed up late watching the finale of \"American Horror Story\" and discussing their differing theories on the show.\n\n\"That's what we did, we were nerds together,\" she said. The couple had been together 10 years and married for seven.\n\nOn Thanksgiving day, Smith was rushed to the intensive care unit after he began vomiting, Elizabeth Smith said.

In response, CBP deployed additional personnel to San Ysidro in expectation of demonstrations on both sides of the border.\n\nAs migrants reached the border area, some protesters split off toward multiple locations, CBP said. Some attempted to enter through San Ysidro and were turned away, the agency said.

He was not involved in the new report.\n\n\"What is happening is that these studies use methods that are a bit more liberal and inclusive than the CDC's methods,\" Frazier said, adding that he prefers the CDC's numbers but understands \"that they are likely a bit conservative.\"\n\nThe new study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, which was conducted by the US Census Bureau and which collected information from parents of more than 50,000 children up to age 17. To be included in the estimate, parents would have had to report that their child had ever received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and that they currently had the condition.\n\nThe new numbers were also slightly lower than those in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey. It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN

recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to

with the Justice Department by lying to the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller's office two months after he started cooperating in the Russia probe, prosecutors said in a new court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing was an astonishing break from the bare-bones updates given by the special counsel's office in other cases where cooperators continue to help Mueller pursue Russian interference in the 2016 US election and alleged coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe brief but remarkable development indicates that not only has the former Trump campaign chairman shared extensive information with Justice Department prosecutors since he began cooperating, but that prosecutors also believe they are able to verify or refute that information. And it signals that Mueller's team may be prepared to reveal the depths of what they have learned.\n\nManafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters,\" violating his plea agreement, prosecutors allege in the three-page filing signed by both the defense team and the prosecution. The special counsel's office says it will provide more details at a later date.\n\nBoth sides ask the judge to now move Manafort's case toward sentencing.\n\nThe filing says Manafort does not agree with prosecutors' assertion that he has lied.\n\n\"He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government's characterization or that he has breached the agreement,\" it says.\n\nIt's rare for criminal defendants' cases to near their end in this manner. Large-scale criminal conspiracy investigations are often built around prosecutors' ability to turn criminals into cooperators, who guide them to other, more significant targets or testify against their former colleagues in court.\n\nIt's not immediately clear what impact the development has on Mueller's work or on other possible criminal cases. But the announcement raised the possibility that President Donald Trump could again see Manafort as an ally and antagonist of Mueller, and consider pardoning him.\n\nManafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy and witness tampering on September 14, almost a year after he was first charged and following his conviction by a jury in a separate but related case on eight tax and banking crimes.\n\nManafort, though he has not made public statements since his plea, was thought to be the star cooperator in the special counsel's ongoing probe. In September and October, he met with Mueller's team at least nine times, amounting to hours of discussions.\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Manafort admitted to committing a host of money laundering and foreign lobbying crimes and fraud, giving the federal prosecutors leverage over him. The cases that Mueller's team brought against Manafort largely focused on his Ukrainian political consulting work, his US lobbying over the last decade and the financial management of his business proceeds. Except for one aspect of their bank fraud case, in which Manafort appeared to dangle access to the Trump campaign in exchange for a bank loan, the cases did not publicly describe Manafort's work as campaign chairman.\n\nFor more than a year now, Manafort has been at the heart of several unresolved threads of the Mueller investigation. He had been in the room for the Trump Tower meeting with Russians who touted they had incriminating information about Hillary Clinton; he had allegedly offered private briefings on the campaign to a Russian oligarch to whom he was indebted, according to The Washington Post ; and he had overseen the Trump campaign in the months when Russian military intelligence allegedly hacked Democratic Party officials.\n\nOne of Manafort's closest business contacts for several years has been Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russia-based political operative who prosecutors have alleged has ties to the same Russian military intelligence service that allegedly hacked the Democrats.\n\nManafort has been held in a Virginia jail since June, after he and Kilimnik were accused of attempting to tamper with possible witnesses before his trial. Kilimnik, though also charged by Mueller, has not surfaced in the US court system.\n\nWhen he was last seen in public, in a Virginia federal courtroom about a month ago, Manafort was in a wheelchair and suffering from a health issue similar to gout. He'll be sentenced in February in his criminal case in Virginia, which he took to trial and lost. It's not clear how Monday's development might affect his situation there.\n\nEven though Mueller's team alleges he's breached his plea agreement, Manafort must comply with the prosecutors' demands going forward. With a circumstance like this, only one side of the deal gets torn up -- and that's the prosecutors' promises of mercy, they said in the filing Monday.\n\nThe judge in DC District Court who received the update Monday night has not yet weighed in, and a sentencing for Manafort's guilty plea has not yet been scheduled."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "READ: Court filing accusing Manafort of lying", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/UsDuHyAl5BE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Paul Manafort has \"breached\" his plea agreement with the Justice Department by lying to the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller's office, prosecutors say."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump disapproval increases in new poll", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/KLC3chcb7A8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Six-in-10 Americans disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing as President, according to a Gallup poll out Monday.

The horse rolled onto Anderson, who hit her head, briefly lost consciousness and broke three ribs.\n\nThe 911 transcript shows that an ambulance reached the 60-year-old judge from Bismarck within 20 minutes. Anderson was secured on a backboard and ready to go when an air ambulance, a helicopter with a medical crew, also landed at the scene. Anderson says her husband asked repeatedly whether the ground ambulance crew could take her by ground; there was a hospital less than an hour's drive away.\n\n\"But he was told that [the air ambulance] was necessary. They never told him why it was necessary or how much it cost, but they insisted I had to go by air ambulance,\" Anderson said. \"But it's so odd there is nothing in the record that indicated it was time-sensitive or that I needed to be airlifted.\"\n\nFor that one helicopter ride, to a hospital farther away in Bismarck, records show that Valley Med Flight charged Anderson $54,727.26. Sanford Health Plan, her insurance, paid $13,697.73. That left Anderson with a $41,029.53 bill.\n\nValley Med Flight did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"It shocked me,\" Anderson said. \"I kept thinking, 'my God.' I got a copy of the 911 and air ambulance report to see how long they actually spent with me, when really, it was only around 45 minutes. I wrote [the air ambulance company] a letter telling them that I thought it was all outrageous.\"\n\nShared outrage\n\nabout air ambulance bills have Anderson is not alone. CNN reached out to every state's insurance regulatory office. Nearly every one said it has heard from patients like Anderson, and complaintsabout air ambulance bills have \"increased rapidly,\" according to the Mississippi commissioner of insurance.\n\nCharges vary wildly. CNN saw bills ranging from nearly $34,000 to more than $533,000.\n\nflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state 2017 federal investigation found that costs for an average air ambulanceflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state investigation found.\n\nEach state's law varies in what can be disclosed about these complaints due to its interpretation of patient privacy. In some cases, CNN could see details about the patient's condition, how far and where they were flown, how much they were charged, how much insurance paid and the nature of the complaint. Some states released much less. Some would acknowledge only that there had been complaints. However, it's clear that these bills can be devastating for families.\n\nOne complaint sent to the Michigan insurance office says a family flew a dying relative home after he got sick in Arizona. To get him to a hospice in Michigan cost $547,725.\n\nIt cost another family $62,749.35 to fly a child with a malignant brain tumor from Wisconsin to Houston to see a specialist.\n\nBut these high prices aren't just for cross-country flights. An air ambulance transferred a man from a hospital in Winter Haven, Florida, to one in Orlando for tests, which would be a one-hour drive. The complaint to the Michigan insurance office about that Florida flight said the family faced a $31,253.33 bill.\n\nJUST WATCHED $4,680 bill for air ambulance hits 17 years later Replay More Videos ...

Instead, they fall under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act , which removed a state's ability to control airfares and routes long before air ambulances were common. October's Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act created a committee to address the problem, but it failed to design a definitive solution, experts say.\n\nAir ambulances take off\n\nAir ambulances became necessary out of a desperate need to save lives, but some question whether their value remains.\n\nIn 1966, civilian deaths from accidental injuries were \"a public health problem second only to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars,\" the National Academy of Sciences wrote at the time.\n\nAir ambulances weren't a regular civilian option then, but when researchers discovered that soldiers wounded in the Vietnam War had better survival rates than California motorists injured in car accidents, the US government decided to fund two medical helicopter experiments in 1969. They were successful, and hospitals slowly started creating their own programs.\n\nThe golden hour\n\nA 'cash cow'\n\nthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion Demand for services wasn't the industry's only growth driver. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new fee schedule that was much more generous to independent operators and paid more for rural trips. Almost immediately, new companies entered the market. Private equity firms, not hospitals, now ownthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion in 2010 and sold it five years later for $2 billion\n\nAs private companies got into the market, prices went up. Between 2010 and 2014, the median price that air ambulance companies charged Medicare doubled to nearly $30,000 a ride, according to a 2017 US Government Accountability Office investigation\n\n\"They have a cash cow on their hands,\" New Mexico state Rep. Liz Thomson said.\n\nThomson said a state analysis also found a 98% increase in the amount charged by air ambulance providers that weren't covered by insurance between 2009 and 2015. When patients travel on helicopters that are not in-network, insurance will cover little or nothing at all.\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services says more firms are accepting insurance -- about a dozen announced that they were going in-network this year -- but still too many do not, Thomson said, and that can be a serious issue.\n\n\"If they aren't in a network, they don't have to adhere to the usual customary fees that insurance will pay,\" said Susan Rider, an employee benefits and human capital HR consultant with Gregory & Appel Insurance in Indianapolis. \"They don't have to participate, so they don't, and then essentially, they can charge what they want.\"\n\nIn 2017, Thomson introduced a bill to cap reimbursement rates and let consumers off the hook for \"balance bills,\" meaning what consumers owe above what insurance pays. The bill failed in the New Mexico Legislature, but she hopes to introduce it again.\n\nThe air ambulance industry packed the committee hearing room when Thomson introduced the bill, but it was not alone.\n\n\"I'm a Democrat and introduce a lot of legislation around patient protection, so I had a running joke that while I don't drink, I would drink a bottle of champagne if the [insurance?] industry ever stood up for any of my bills,\" Thomson said. \"Sure enough, I needed to buy a bottle, because when the chair asked who was in favor of the bill, all these insurance people stood up and said, 'we are.' This practice is costing them a mint. It's outrageous.\"\n\nMike Castleberry , senior vice president of network services and business development for HealthSCOPE Benefits , a national firm that helps major companies manage health plans, said the costs for these services don't add up. \"When you really get into the math, it starts to get embarrassing for the folks running those businesses,\" he said.\n\n\"We know what their fuel costs. We know how many hours they fly and how much it costs for a pilot,\" Castleberry said. \"Add up all those factors, even if you give them a 20% profit on top of that, that's still not even half what they are charging me, which is more like 300 to 400 times what it actually costs to fly our customers. When I can go rent a private plane and put medical personnel on board for less than some of these bills, I know it shouldn't cost this much.\"\n\nHe also notes that a lot of patients whose bills the firm sees, who are told to take these flights, aren't trauma cases. \"They are not for a wreck on the side of the road needing Level I trauma care,\" Castleberry said. \"Only about 15% of the air ambulance charges we see involve those kind of accidents. The vast majority are patient transfers from one facility to the other.\"\n\nCastleberry, who has clients across the country, said private operators aren't the only ones making money. \"County governments and city hospitals [which can have their own air ambulance services] also see it as a revenue stream that supports their overall programs,\" he said.\n\nThe actual costs\n\nThe air medical transport industry argues that although single flights \"may appear to be expensive,\" they are \"very cost-effective\" compared with building new rural specialty care or expanding ground ambulance capabilities.\n\nStaffing an independent helicopter around the clock is expensive. It costs about $3 million to run an independent air medical base that does roughly 300 transports a year, said Chris Eastlee , vice president of government relations for the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nSome in the industry argue the problem is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services don't pay enough. They created current rates in 2002, based on an estimated 1998 cost pool, increasing reimbursement for inflation only. \"It was never based on real cost collection,\" said Rick Sherlock , the association's ex-officio president and CEO.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the patients whom air ambulances transport fall into these categories that the industry argue significantly underpay, like patients with Medicare. This payment is significantly less than the cost of the transportation, Sherlock said.\n\n\"Medicare pays about 60% of the cost of the flight; Medicaid pays 35% or less. Self-paid patients pay a few cents on the dollar, and that has led to a crisis of being able to sustain the service,\" Eastlee said. That means about 7 out of 10 of the association's flights are under-reimbursed, he said.\n\nIf the government reimburses the industry more, Sherlock said, \"you eliminate the need to balance bill.\"\n\nThe insured pay the costs\n\nAnderson, who was billed $54,727.26 total for her air ambulance rescue from the Badlands, got a letter from the air ambulance company's lawyer when she wrote to protest the price. HIs letter explains that 75% of that company's patients are covered by the government or have no insurance at all.\n\n\"This governmentally mandated cost shifting means that their cost per transport must be borne by others,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"In other words, I may not have had $54,000 worth of treatment, but essentially, they have to make up their costs somehow,\" Anderson said. \"It's not fair at all.\"\n\n\"Some of these bills are pretty egregious, and these are consumers who have done everything right,\" Godfread said. \"They have health insurance, they ask questions ahead of time, and often, they don't get to make the choice. It's often the hospital or the EMTs that decide to fly, but consumers are the ones left paying the bills, and there's really no way for consumers to protect themselves.\"\n\nAndrei Courier learned that the hard way in June. He got a $41,063.78 bill after the in-network hospital where he took his son Jacob with breathing problems transferred the boy to an out-of-network hospital.\n\nJacob Courier's air ambulance hospital transfer cost $41,063.78.\n\n\"First, I could have driven to that other hospital faster,\" Courier said. \"We also had tried to do everything in-network. We did everything right insurance-wise, but we still faced this huge bill.\"\n\nHis insurance company picked up $8,960.49 of the bill, that meant he would be left paying $32,103.29 out-of-pocket.\n\n\"We work hard, we pay our bills on time, and this is how we are repaid,\" Courier said. \"It was so frustrating. That's money we would use for my son's college, not for a short helicopter ride.\"\n\nCourier made multiple phone calls to the company, a lawyer and the Mississippi insurance commissioner. He learned that the state has a law that prevents balance billing , which is when insurance covers part of the bill and the patient owes the rest. Eventually, the cost of the flight was forgiven.\n\n\"I don't know what the insurance commissioner said to the company, but I finally got a call and was told they weren't going to balance bill me,\" Courier said, but he's still upset.\n\nMed Trans Air Medical Transport, which ran the air ambulance that day, referred questions to the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nStates try to help\n\nOther state insurance offices say usually there's little they can do, beyond holding insurance companies to the letter of their policies. Most offices encourage patients to call with complaints.\n\nThough states like Mississippi have balance billing protection, that tactic has had limited success elsewhere, as the courts have ruled that laws affecting air ambulances are federal, not state, jurisdiction.\n\nNorth Dakota tried another approach. Its 2015 law required providers to disclose prices before the flight, upon request. Hospitals that referred a patient to the air ambulance company had to let the patient know the cost ahead of time unless the hospital determined that doing so would jeopardize their health or safety, in which case they would be exempt. The courts overturned that legislation, ruling that it was a federal matter.\n\nNorth Dakota's 2017 legislation requires hospitals to notify patients in non-emergency situations if the helicopter takes their insurance. \"We are optimistic. It is squarely in the claims process that we have the authority to regulate,\" Godfread said. \"It will, however, likely be appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services believes that the states can \"help patients right now and help address the issue of balance billing and take patients out of the middle,\" Eastlee said. \"Some insurance only covers a fraction of the price for those transports. We can work together.\"\n\nThe Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\" Virginia is trying another approach. Starting in March, its new law will require hospitals tell patients who don't have an \"emergency medical condition\" that they have a choice between air and ground transportation.The Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\"\n\nCongress and the law\n\nIt will probably take an act of Congress to regulate the air ambulance industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act , passed in October, created an advisory committee with all the players involved who will focus on improving price transparency. The law gives the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to create new rules. It establishes a hotline and website to track complaints, and it creates an aviation consumer advocate position.\n\n\"It was important to me that we craft a solution that not only empowers consumers and patients but lays the groundwork for long-term solutions in the industry,\" said US Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia, who added the air ambulance-specific language to the bill. \"By creating an aviation consumer advocate, much like the taxpayer advocate for those with complaints against the IRS, my amendment provides a clear mechanism through which consumers can pursue enforcement or corrective actions -- which to this point had been absent in these situations.\"\n\nThe industry association said that it supports the FAA Reauthorization Act because it \"enhanced consumer protection\" and that the industry does want more transparency and accountability, Eastlee said, \"but we also have to work to sustain the service.\"\n\nSherlock added, \"the amendment does not address the underlying problem to reduce the patient's balance bill .\"\n\nFor Anderson, Congress is too late. She took her own action. Instead of paying $41,029.53 out of pocket, she offered to settle for $4,100, on top of the $13,000 her insurance paid.\n\n\"I thought, I didn't want them to sue me and wanted to get this out of the way and thought 10% more was reasonable,\" Anderson said. For three months, she heard nothing from the company, so she wrote to withdraw her offer. The next month, the company offered to negotiate, documents show, but eventually, it accepted her offer.\n\nAnderson's recovered from her injuries. And Cody, her horse, is OK. She brought him some extra feed to thank him, as the X-rays detected another medical issue she is now in treatment for. But the experience with the air ambulance still bothers her.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"For a little more than 45 minutes of service, they were asking for more than what my surgeon charged. It's not fair,\" Anderson said. \"I've since talked to other people who have been transported with no surprise bills, I think air ambulances can run in a fair manner, but the way it is currently done seems unfair and unreasonable.

He was not involved in the new report.\n\n\"What is happening is that these studies use methods that are a bit more liberal and inclusive than the CDC's methods,\" Frazier said, adding that he prefers the CDC's numbers but understands \"that they are likely a bit conservative.\"\n\nThe new study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, which was conducted by the US Census Bureau and which collected information from parents of more than 50,000 children up to age 17. To be included in the estimate, parents would have had to report that their child had ever received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and that they currently had the condition.\n\nThe new numbers were also slightly lower than those in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey. It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study's authors also note that universal screening recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to Frazier.\n\n\"Having prevalence estimates -- even if there is some variation -- helps us to advocate for improved screening, diagnosis, interventions and supports,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "AFM: CDC identifies 31 states with 116 confirmed cases of polio-like disease", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Xzbu7vS_wy4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There are now 286 cases of possible and confirmed acute flaccid myelitis in the United States this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThat includes 116 confirmed cases of the rare polio-like illness, also known as AFM, that leads to sudden onset of paralysis.

The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \"no convincing alternative explanation\" for the changing climate other than \"human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe report's findings run counter to President Donald Trump's consistent message that climate change is a hoax.\n\nBut the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear: Climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week; it's demonstrated by long-term trends. Humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history . Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWithout significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says.\n\nThe expense\n\nThe costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat.\n\nFarmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield.\n\nHeat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years -- having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010.\n\nRed tides, or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent. When it comes to shellfish there will be a $230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification, which is already killing off shellfish and corals.Red tides,or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent.\n\nImpacts on our health\n\nHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090.\n\nWest Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. There will be more mosquito- and tickborne diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures.\n\nExpect asthma and allergies to be worse due to climate change\n\nParticularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death. No one's health is immune from climate change, the report concludes. People will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases.Particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death.\n\nHeat and flooding\n\nWildfire seasons -- already longer and more destructive than before -- could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050.\n\nDependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures.\n\nAlong the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges.\n\nEnergy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said.\n\nThe number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days.\n\nSea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater.\n\nBy midcentury, it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, \"possibly significantly.\"\n\nWhat can be done\n\nThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country.\n\nBut the The Defense Department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security.But the Trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the Paris climate accord, aimed at lowering global temperatures, claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the US economy.\n\nA report from the UN in October urged all governments to take \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" to avoid disaster from climate change. That report predicted that the Earth will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. It also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nTime for action\n\nReactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community.\n\n\"If we're going to run this country like a business, it's time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost,\" said Robert Bullard, an environmental scientist at Texas Southern University.\n\n\"In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause.

President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that \"to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers.\"\n\nInSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator. Before landing, Nasa had dubbed it the \"biggest parking lot on Mars\".\n\nThe first picture of this landscape came back very quickly, within minutes. It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings.\n\nThe image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon.\n\nA later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance\n\nWhat happened in the landing?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California\n\nLike all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair.\n\nStage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress.\n\nIt had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop.\n\nInSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent.\n\nThe robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing.\n\nOne of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander.\n\nIt was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions.\n\nAnd as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars.\n\n\"Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,\" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth\n\nWhat is different about the InSight mission?\n\nThis will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German-led \"mole\" system will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bruce Banerdt: \"Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries\"\n\nWhy do we need to know this?\n\nScientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time.\n\nInSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: \"The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Spectators gathered in New York's Times Square to watch the landing\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Matthew Hedges release: Academic praises 'brave' wife", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-46355134", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:31", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Daniela Tejada Image caption Daniela Tejada helped secure her husband's release\n\nThe British academic jailed for spying in UAE has thanked his \"brave and strong\" wife Daniela Tejada for helping secure his release.\n\nMatthew Hedges, 31, landed back at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday morning after receiving a pardon.\n\nHe said: \"I could not have done this without Daniela.

And 33% of male graduates went to a university in which there was a \"negligible or negative impact\" on earnings compared with those without a degree.\n\nThese figures have been adjusted to take into account the background of students and previous academic achievement - making it a like-for-like comparison.\n\nHigh-income subjects\n\nThe report comes as a review is examining the future of tuition fees in England - with suggestions that fees of \u00a39,250 per year and average loans debts of \u00a350,000 are to be reduced.\n\nBut the report shows that apart from gender, the type of university and subject have a significant influence on future income.\n\nMedicine, economics, maths and science are likely to deliver higher earnings.\n\nBut studying art, English and philosophy, particularly for men, can leave graduates on average earning lower than those who did not go to university.\n\nGoing to a Russell Group university is linked to increased earnings - but the data suggests at least one of the leading universities, so far unnamed, has graduates with salaries no higher than non-graduates.\n\nThese factors can combine to increase or decrease earnings - so that women taking medicine can earn 75% more than female non-graduates, while men taking an arts degree have likely earnings 14% below male non-graduates.\n\nThe graduates least likely to be high earners are the men who have studied an arts degree at a modern university.\n\n'Excellent investment'\n\nThe figures are a snapshot of the position at the age of 29 - and they do not show what might happen next, which could include women's earnings being affected by having children and male graduates pulling further ahead of non-graduates.\n\nJack Britton, co-author of the report with Chris Belfield, says the study shows \"university is an excellent investment for women\".\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nFor men, the figures might look \"disappointing\", says the IFS researcher.

By 2015, this proportion had risen to 72%.\n\nMeanwhile, five-year survival has increased from 42% to 53%.\n\nBut other nations have improved too. The Health Foundation highlighted the UK's performance against five other nations - Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThis was done for six key cancers - colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian and prostate.\n\nFor each, the UK has remained in the bottom two since 2000 for five-year survival. Only on breast cancer has it actually closed the gap with the best.\n\nThe think tank highlighted figures showing 10,000 deaths could be prevented each year with better diagnosis. That represents one in 13 deaths from the disease.\n\nWhat is the problem?\n\nSir Mike talks about the \"tight gate-keeping\" in the NHS.\n\nHe said GPs were under pressure not to refer too many patients, while the NHS did not have enough equipment or staff to carry out all the tests and scans it ideally should.\n\nTackling this would require major investment, the report said.\n\nGPs refer nearly two million patients a year for urgent tests and scans - nearly four times the number they did over a decade ago.\n\nBut the rise in referrals has coincided with long waiting times, with the NHS now struggling to meet its targets.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnd despite the extra numbers being referred, one in five cases is still diagnosed via an emergency presentation in places such as accident and emergency units.\n\nPatients diagnosed via this route are less likely to survive as the cancer has been diagnosed late.\n\nSir Mike said services had also been undermined by the 2012 Health and Care Act, which led to regional cancer specialist groups being scrapped as part of the wider shake-up of the health service.\n\nHe said this had prompted lots of experienced professionals to leave the NHS.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nSir Mike welcomed the fact the government had promised extra funding - \u00a320bn extra a year by 2023 - and that cancer would be a key focus for that.\n\nLast month, the prime minister promised a new strategy to ensure three-quarters of cancer were diagnosed early - currently only half are.\n\nNHS England is already piloting rapid diagnostic clinics. These are basically one-stop testing centres where patients can get access to a range of different specialists and procedures often on the same day.\n\nSir Mike said these steps would help.\n\nHe also called for more to be done to raise awareness among the public of the signs and symptoms to look out for - research shows people in the UK are sometimes reluctant to come forward when they are showing signs of cancer.\n\nAnd he said the NHS needed to look at new approaches, pointing to research showing people at high risk of lung cancer could benefit from a new form of screening for the disease by using low-dose CT scans.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said improving early diagnosis was a \"key priority\", pointing out from next year a new 28-day target for diagnosis would be rolled out.\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Safety concerns raised over breast implants", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46329824", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:00:50", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Implants can be \"textured\" or \"smooth\"\n\nAn investigation has raised safety concerns about the most commonly used type of silicone breast implant in the UK.\n\nWomen in France are now being advised not to use \"textured\" silicone implants while authorities investigate links with a rare form of cancer.\n\nBritish women are still having the implants put in and there has been no warning from the UK regulator to stop.\n\nIt says it will take action when it sees there is a problem.\n\nA Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) spokesman said: \"We know that there are ongoing concerns about the safety of silicone breast implants - we're keeping a very close eye on that.\"\n\nManufacturers say the safety of the implants is supported by extensive testing and studies, as well as more than a decade of use in America and Europe.\n\nThe BBC's Panorama programme has been investigating implants with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and organisations around the world, including the Guardian newspaper and the British Medical Journal.\n\n'Mortified'\n\nJanet Trelawny had breast cancer over 20 years ago.

It is less common in women who have been through the menopause\n\nIt is a long-term condition that can have a significant impact on your life, but there are treatments that can help\n\nSymptoms include: Pain in your lower tummy or back (pelvic pain) - usually worse during your period; pain when going to the toilet during your period; feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, or blood in your urine during your period; difficulty getting pregnant\n\nFor some women, endometriosis can have a big impact on their life and may sometimes lead to feelings of depression\n\nDiagnosis and surgery\n\nMs Roach had surgery following the diagnosis.\n\n\"Half of my left side of my organs had all fused together [because of scarring and adhesions].

She was also told the condition had affected her chances of promotion at work.\n\nShe also knows she is likely to need surgery in the future and does not know how her chances of having children will be affected, adding her partner had \"been to hell and back with me\".\n\n\"There needs to be a recognition that there isn't enough being done to recognise and diagnose the disease. It's horrendous being in pain but it's even worse when you have no idea why,\" Ms Roach said.\n\n\"It's the leading cause for infertility and it would make a huge difference to my life, to so many different women's lives, if diagnosis could happen earlier and the damage prevented and the fertility preserved.\"\n\nThe report found current provision across all levels of service from GPs to specialists was not meeting need, and a lack of understanding of the condition led to delays in diagnosis, poor management of symptoms and negative outcomes for patients.\n\nThe report makes a number of proposals, including:\n\nEarly education in menstrual well-being from primary school age onwards and timely response to symptoms by GPs, with onwards referral for further investigation with an endometriosis specialist gynaecologist if necessary\n\nEach health board in Wales should identify one or more endometriosis consultant leads and provide a specialist nurse.

President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that \"to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers.\"\n\nInSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator. Before landing, Nasa had dubbed it the \"biggest parking lot on Mars\".\n\nThe first picture of this landscape came back very quickly, within minutes. It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings.\n\nThe image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon.\n\nA later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance\n\nWhat happened in the landing?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California\n\nLike all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair.\n\nStage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress.\n\nIt had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop.\n\nInSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent.\n\nThe robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing.\n\nOne of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander.\n\nIt was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions.\n\nAnd as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars.\n\n\"Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,\" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth\n\nWhat is different about the InSight mission?\n\nThis will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German-led \"mole\" system will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior.

Around Aberystwyth in Wales, they range from 0.9C to 5.9C warmer while Cookstown in Northern Ireland could be 0.8 to 4.9C hotter.\n\nBut even under a low emissions scenario, the Met Office says that the UK will see an increase in the average yearly temperature of up to 2.3C by 2100.\n\nSummers as warm as the one just past, are likely to be very common, with a 50% chance of occurring.\n\n\"With really hot summers like this year's - in the 1990s that was a less than 5% chance of getting those,\" said Met Office chief scientist Dr Stephen Belcher.\n\n\"Now we are up to a 15-20% chance.

Tens of thousands are believed to have died since the war began.\n\n\"Simply said, we came here today to say that the Tunisian people - who have exported the revolution to the rest of the [Arab] world and who fought for justice, dignity and human rights - cannot welcome a criminal like bin Salman,\" Hamza Nasri, the mime artist playing MBS, said.\n\nTunisia made world headlines in 2011 after long-time autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali was deposed following mass demonstrations, triggering a wave of uprisings across the Middle East that saw the departure of three other Arab presidents.\n\nBut the deposed leader has been a fugitive in Saudi Arabia since 2011, and Riyadh has consistently ignored extradition requests from Tunis.\n\nInstead, Ben Ali was handed lengthy prison sentences and hefty monetary fines in a series of trials in absentia, on charges ranging from complicity in the killing of several hundred protesters during the uprising to misappropriating public funds, to trafficking in drugs, weapons and archaeological artefacts.\n\n\"Perhaps as a people in the past we [Tunisians] could not speak our minds. But today we can,\" said Emna Mizouni, another protester.\n\n\"It is shameful for Tunisia, which received the Nobel Peace Prize, to receive someone like this,\" she said of the Saudi crown prince.\n\nIn 2015, the Tunisian National Dialogue Quarter, a democracy group credited with staving off another uprising in the country, was awarded the international peace prize.\n\nMBS also visited the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt - all staunch allies of Saudi Arabia - and is expected in Argentina for the G20 summit on Friday.\n\nBecause Tunisia is a pioneering country when it comes to promoting human rights, \"there is no reason why not to come out and say no to MBS\", said Mizouni.\n\n\"Everyone is against whitewashing oppression. Unfortunately, our Arab brothers could not organise similar protests,\" she said, adding the demonstration not only highlighted Tunisians' anger but spoke \"in the name of all oppressed Arab people\" who could not organise publicly to condemn the crown prince's policies.\n\nSimilar performance art protests took place when Ben Ali invited late Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to Tunis in 2005, and several Tunisians also protested a visit by Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\n\n\"This is not new,\" said Aouadi. The point is, \"post-revolution Tunisia continues to receive leaders and officials with blood on their hands,\" he continued. The same people who protested Sharon and others are here to express their rejection of that, said Aouadi.\n\nSymbolic lawsuits\n\nMBS' trip to Tunis, made known last week, has generated widespread condemnation among civil society for days.\n\nOn Monday, the Tunisian Journalists' Syndicate (SNJT) announced it planned to file a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed at an international court for \"war crimes committed by the Saudi regime in Yemen\".\n\nIn an open letter addressed to President Beji Caid Essebsi days prior, the union slammed MBS as a \"danger for the safety and the peace of the region and the world, and a real threat to freedom of expression\".\n\n\"Tunisians reject the war crimes being committed in Yemen and the obvious human rights transgressions against Saudi activists like Jamal Khashoggi,\" Sakina Abdel Samad, an SNJT member, told reporters during a press conference.\n\nA giant poster of the Saudi prince holding a chainsaw has been hung outside the group's office. \"No to the desecration of Tunisia, land of the revolution,\" read the banner.\n\nIn another symbolic move, a group of 50 lawyers announced they too filed a lawsuit with a Tunisian court to pressure the government to cancel the crown prince's visit.\n\n\"We have officially requested an investigation into crimes committed by bin Salman,\" Nizar Boujalal, a spokesman for the lawyers, told reporters.\n\nMBS's involvement in Yemen - in addition to his alleged role in Khashoggi's killing and the detention of the female activists - has put the country's ties with Western allies under tight scrutiny.\n\nIt remains to be seen which leaders shake hands and pose for photos with the crown prince at the G20 in Buenos Aires later this week."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "British scholar Matthew Hedges arrives in London after UAE pardon", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/british-scholar-matthew-hedges-arrives-london-uae-pardon-181127072248539.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "British academic Matthew Hedges, who was jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has arrived in the United Kingdom a day after being pardoned by the Emirati president, ending a seven-month ordeal.\n\nA flight carrying the 31-year-old scholar landed at London's Heathrow airport on Tuesday morning, according to Reuters news agency.\n\nAbu Dhabi's Federal Court of Appeal had sentenced the British scholar to life in prison last week after he was convicted of spying and supplying sensitive security information to external actors.\n\nHe was among more than 700 people pardoned by President Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan on Monday, the country's national day.\n\nEmirati officials made a point on Monday to insist that the arrest came on solid grounds, showing journalists in Abu Dhabi short video clips of Hedges purportedly acknowledging his intelligence work.\n\nIn one video clip, Hedges is seen describing himself as a captain in MI-6 during what appears to be a court hearing in the Gulf Arab country.\n\nAnother clip appears to show Hedges speaking to someone in an office and saying: \"It helps the research to go in an easy way.\"\n\nThen, Hedges is seen snapping his fingers and adds: \"Then it becomes MI-6.\"\n\nEmirati officials did not allow journalists to record the video.\n\n\"He was a part-time PhD researcher, a part-time businessman, but he was a 100 percent full-time secret service operative,\" said Jaber al-Lamki, an official with the UAE's National Media Council.\n\n\"Mr Hedges has been found guilty of espionage.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "'There Were Children,' says Migrant Mother Tear-gassed at US Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/there-were-children-says-migrant-mother-tear-gassed-at-us-border/4675369.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "A migrant mother photographed running with her daughters from tear gas at the U.S.-Mexico border said she never expected the U.S. Border Patrol to fire gas canisters at children and families.\n\nAfter traveling north from Honduras and spending a week in the Mexican border town of Tijuana, Maria Meza, 35, set out on Sunday with her five children to claim asylum at the U.S. border crossing.\n\nShe and hundreds of other Central American migrants were blocked by Mexican police and staged a protest in front of the border, some rushing the U.S fence.\n\nThree tear gas canisters shot from the U.S. side landed around Meza and her children, who range in age from toddlers to teenagers, she said in an interview at a Tijuana migrant shelter.\n\n\"The first thing I did was grab my children,\" said Meza.

Deval Patrick \u2014 have been to Mississippi to campaign for the former congressman who served as agriculture secretary in 1993 and 1994 under Democratic President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nFor Espy, turnout is key. He has to close the gap in a state where Trump received 58 percent in 2016. Mississippi hasn't elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1982.\n\n\n\n\"I know I can't win only with black votes,\" Espy said Monday in the Jackson suburb of Ridgeland. \"That's never been where we are. We've got to get votes from everybody. I tell everyone. I need Republicans, I need independents, I need those who have never voted before to come out tomorrow and vote for me.\"\n\n\n\nAbout a third of Mississippi voters were African-American in the four-way race on Election Day, and Espy won support from about 80 percent of them, compared to about 20 percent from white voters, according to VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press.\n\n\n\nEspy hasn't hammered Hyde-Smith on Trump at every turn. His campaign has focused more on issues such as social justice, health care and raising wages.\n\n\n\nEspy also has carefully picked his time to talk about race. He does remind voters that while Hyde-Smith attended a white private school founded after court-ordered desegregation of public schools, he and his twin sister were being called racial slurs while integrating Yazoo City High School in 1969.\n\n\n\nHyde-Smith has apologized to \"anyone that was offended\" by the hanging comment, saying she meant no ill will. She and her campaign have refused to talk about the Confederate hat and have called the school issue a personal attack on her family meant to draw attention away from issues.\n\n\n\nWalmart asked Hyde-Smith to return a $2,000 campaign contribution because of the hanging remark."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "The Power and Headaches of Capitol Hill's Top Job", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/power-headaches-capitol-hill-top-job-speaker-house/4674495.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "When Democrats hold leadership elections this week, they will be choosing the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives for the 116th Congress \u2014 the 55th person in U.S. history to serve in this critical government position.\n\nFormer House speaker Nancy Pelosi of California is favored to win the role for the second time, returning as the only woman to serve in the job, and the only woman to serve twice. If she wins, Pelosi will take over the position when the new Congress is sworn in next January, claiming the role from Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, who has served as speaker since 2015.\n\nRyan is retiring from the U.S. Congress at the end of this term, but he would have been unable to continue as speaker even if he had decided to stay on. The position ostensibly is elected by the full membership of the House, but in fact the party in power gets to select one of its own to lead the House. Democrats won back control in the November midterm elections and likely will hold at least 233 of the 435 seats in the chamber.\n\nSelection process\n\nBy tradition, the speaker is chosen from within the majority party's senior leadership, but there are few official rules governing the process.\n\nTechnically, anyone \u2014 even someone who is not a member of the House of Representatives \u2014 could be elected speaker. But this has yet to happen. The speaker of the house continues to serve as the representative of his or her congressional district, handling constituents' concerns and voting on legislation, as well as tending to the larger administrative duties of running the House.\n\nSpeaker elections are held every two years when a new Congress is sworn into office. The selection of a new speaker also occurs if a speaker dies in office, is removed for wrongdoing, or steps aside partway through a Congress. This was the case when Speaker John Boehner resigned in 2015 under pressure from his own Republican members, initiating the election that resulted in the selection of Ryan.\n\n\u200bBroad powers\n\nThe position of speaker was established in 1789 by an article of the U.S. Constitution. Over time, the speaker assumed important political responsibilities beyond the procedural responsibilities laid out by the founders of the United States.\n\nOf utmost importance, the speaker is second in line to succeed the president \u2014 behind the vice president, and ahead of the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate. If the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker would become acting president of the United States. This scenario has yet to occur in U.S. history.\n\nIn modern times, the speaker has wielded power in a number of ways. He or she is key in setting the legislative agenda for the majority party, serving as his or her congressional party's public face, making committee assignments, and governing the bill debate process. The speaker is also in charge of managing the complicated rules and procedures governing the House.\n\nAll government spending and tax legislation must originate in the House under the Constitution, which gives the speaker and his or her committee chairmen considerable leverage in negotiating with the Senate and the White House.\n\nOver the decades, power has shifted back and forth between the speaker and House committee chairmen. In the mid-1990s, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years during the Clinton administration, Speaker Newt Gingrich consolidated power within the speaker's office and enhanced its role as a political force.\n\nGingrich, an iconoclastic Georgia Republican, said he saw his position \"as essentially the political leader of a grassroots movement seeking to do nothing less than reshape the federal government along with the political culture of the nation.\"\n\n\u200bChallenges\n\nThis broad political power can generate significant problems. The speaker has to manage the often-conflicting demands of factions within his or her party and marshal enough votes to pass pieces of legislation.\n\nRyan's tenure was marked by the challenges of governing his own caucus \u2014 including negotiating the concerns of the House Freedom Caucus, a powerful conservative voting bloc within the Republican Party.\n\nRyan also had to find a way to pass legislation while contending with President Donald Trump's mercurial leadership style. He was often called upon to answer for some of Trump's more controversial public statements and tweets.\n\nSpeaker elections are usually decided in party meetings before the decision goes to a full House floor vote in January. By tradition, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes from all members to be elected. The last time a speaker election was contested on the House floor was in 1923.\n\nPelosi faces a challenge from within her own party from younger and newly elected members who have publicly said it is time for Democrats to have fresh perspectives in leadership. Sixteen Democrats signed a letter last week vowing to oppose Pelosi for speaker on the House floor, while several others including freshmen Mikie Sherill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia have threatened to do the same.\n\nPelosi, 78, who was first elected to the House in 1987, can only afford to lose 15 Democratic votes and still win the speakership. If she can't secure the necessary majority of Democrats in Wednesday's party caucus, the battle will move to the House floor, where she could use the additional time for further negotiations with dissident members of her own party or \u2014 far less likely \u2014 attempt to win over Republican votes for a majority.\n\nSo far, no one within the House Democratic Caucus has emerged to challenge Pelosi. Representative Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio weighed a run but announced last week she would vote for Pelosi in return for support of her legislative priorities."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Scientists Warn New Brazil President May Smother Rainforest", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-warn-new-brazil-president-may-smother-rainforest/4675371.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Scientists warn that Brazil's president-elect could push the Amazon rainforest past its tipping point \u2014 with severe consequences for global climate and rainfall.\n\n\n\nJair Bolsonaro, who takes office Jan. 1, claims a mandate to convert land for cattle pastures and soybean farms, calling Brazil's rainforest protections an economic obstacle.\n\n\n\nBrazilians on Oct. 28 elected Bolsonaro, a far-right candidate who channeled outrage at the corruption scandals of the former government and support from agribusiness groups.\n\n\n\nNext week global leaders will meet in Poland for an international climate conference to discuss how to curb climate change, and questions about Brazil's role in shaping the future of the Amazon rainforest after Bolsonaro's election loom large. New Brazilian government data show the rate of deforestation \u2014 a major factor in global warming \u2014 has already increased over the past year.\n\n\n\nBrazil contains about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest, and scientists are worried.\n\n\n\nIt's nearly impossible to overstate the importance of the Amazon rainforest to the planet's living systems, said Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\n\nEach tree stores carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. The Amazon takes in as much as 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year and releases 20 percent of the planet's oxygen, earning it the nickname \"the lungs of the planet.\"\n\n\n\nIt's also a global weather-maker.\n\n\n\nStretching 10 times the size of Texas, the Amazon is the world's largest rainforest. Billions of trees suck up water through deep roots and bring it up to their leaves, which release water vapor that forms a thick mist over the rainforest canopy.\n\n\n\nThis mist ascends into clouds and eventually becomes rainfall \u2014 a cycle that shapes seasons in South America and far beyond.\n\n\n\nBy one estimate, the Amazon creates 30 to 50 percent of its own rainfall.\n\n\n\nNow the integrity of all of three functions \u2014 as a carbon sink, the Earth's lungs, and a rainmaker \u2014 hangs in the balance.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bolsonaro promised to loosen protections for areas of the Brazilian Amazon designated as indigenous lands and nature reserves, calling them impediments to economic growth. \"All these reserves cause problems to development,\" he told supporters.\n\n\n\nHe has also repeatedly talked about gutting the power of the environmental ministry to enforce existing green laws.\n\n\n\n\"If Bolsonaro keeps his campaign promises, deforestation of the Amazon will probably increase quickly \u2014 and the effects will be felt everywhere on the planet,\" said Paulo Artaxo, a professor of environmental physics at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\n\nBolsonaro's transition team did not respond to an interview request from the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nBrazil was once seen as a global environmental success story. Between 2004 and 2014, stricter enforcement of laws to safeguard the rainforest \u2014 aided by regular satellite monitoring and protections for lands designated reserves for indigenous peoples \u2014 sharply curbed the rate of deforestation, which peaked in the early 2000s at about 9,650 square miles a year (25,000 square kilometers).\n\n\n\nAfter a political crisis engulfed Brazil, leading to the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, enforcement faltered. Ranchers and farmers began to convert more rainforest to pastureland and cropland. Between 2014 and 2017, annual deforestation doubled to about 3,090 square miles (8,000 square kilometers). Most often, the trees and underbrush cut down are simply burned, directly releasing carbon dioxide, said Artaxo.\n\n\n\n\"In the Brazilian Amazon, far and away the largest source of deforestation is industrial agriculture and cattle ranching,\" said Emilio Bruna, an ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville.\n\nNow observers are parsing Bolsonaro's campaign statements and positions as a congressman to anticipate what's next for the Amazon.\n\n\n\nBolsonaro \u2014 who some call \"tropical Trump\" because of some similarities to U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 is a former army captain with a knack for channeling outrage and generating headlines. As a federal congressman for 27 years, he led legislative campaigns to unravel land protections for indigenous people and to promote agribusiness. He also made derogatory comments about minorities, women, and LGBT people.\n\n\n\nMuch of his support comes from business and farming interests.\n\n\n\n\"These farmers are not invaders, they are producers,\" said congressman and senator-elect Luiz Carlos Heinze, a farmer and close ally of Bolsonaro. He blamed past \"leftist administrations\" for promoting indigenous rights at the expense of farmers and ranchers.\n\n\n\n\"Brazil will be the biggest farming nation on Earth during Bolsonaro's years,\" said Heinze.\n\n\n\nIndigenous-rights advocates are worried about the new direction signaled. \"Bolsonaro has repeatedly said that indigenous territories in the Amazon should be opened up for mining and agribusiness, which goes completely in the opposite direction of our Constitution,\" said Adriana Ramos, public policy coordinator at Social Environmental Institute in Brasilia, a non-governmental group.\n\n\n\nIn a Nov. 1 postelection interview with Catholic TV, Bolsonaro said, \"We intend to protect the environment, but without creating difficulties for our progress.\"\n\n\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly said that Brazil should withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, a treaty his predecessor signed in 2016 committing to reduce carbon emissions 37 percent over 2005 levels by 2030. After the election, he has publicly wavered.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile he has named a climate-change denier, Ernesto Araujo, to become the next foreign minister.\n\n\n\nNelson Ananias Filho, sustainability coordinator at Brazil's National Agriculture and Cattle Raising Confederation, which backed Bolsonaro's campaign, said, \"Brazil's agribusiness will adapt to whatever circumstances come.\"\n\n\n\nWhether or not Brazil formally remains in the Paris Climate Accord, the only way for the country to make its emission targets is to completely stop deforestation by 2030 and to reduce agricultural emissions, said Nobre, the climate scientist. \"If Bolsonaro keeps moving in the current direction, that's basically impossible.\"\n\n\n\nThere's another danger lurking in deforestation.\n\n\n\nAside from the oceans, tropical forests are the most important regions on the planet for putting water vapor in the air, which eventually becomes rainfall. \"It's why we have rain in the American Midwest and other inland areas \u2014 it's not just the Amazon, but it's the largest tropical rainforest,\" said Bill Laurance, a tropical ecologist at James Cook University in Cairns, Australia.\n\n\n\nCarlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy, an environmental scientist at George Mason University, have estimated that the \"tipping point for the Amazon system\" is 20 to 25 percent deforestation.\n\n\n\nWithout enough trees to sustain the rainfall, the longer and more pronounced dry season could turn more than half the rainforest into a tropical savannah, they wrote in February in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\n\nIf the rainfall cycle collapses, winter droughts in parts of Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina could devastate agriculture, they wrote. The impacts may even be felt as far away as the American Midwest, said Laurance.\n\n\n\nBolsonaro's rhetoric about potentially dismantling the environmental ministry and rolling back indigenous rights worries Nobre who says, \"I am a scientist, but I am also a Brazilian citizen, and a citizen of the planet.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Ocean Shock: Fishmeal Factories Plunder Africa", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ocean-shock-fishmeal-factories-plunder-africa/4674766.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "This is part of \"Ocean Shock,\" a Reuters series exploring climate change's impact on sea creatures and the people who depend on them.\n\nGreyhound Bay was once a place where old ships came to die. A wild stretch of coast on the western edge of the Sahara, its shallows made a convenient, if desolate, spot to scuttle an obsolete trawler, freighter or tug. So many vessels went to their graves here, the nearby port of Nouadhibou seemed captive to a ghostly armada keeping vigil over the dunes.\n\nToday, navigators plotting a course for this gateway to the West African nation of Mauritania have no intention of abandoning ship. Turkish fishing boats bob at anchor, laundry strung out to dry above deck. In the open sea, the convex hulls of Chinese vessels carve V-shaped wakes through the swells.\n\nNearer shore, nomads-turned-octopus-catchers scan the surface through the eye-slits of headgear that once shielded them from sandstorms.\n\nBut the most lucrative activity of all takes place behind high walls. It would be easy to miss entirely \u2014 were it not for the stomach-turning stench.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, factory manager Hamoud El-Mami watched through a warehouse gate at Africa Prot\u00e9ine SA as two of his workers trudged knee-deep through a silvery, undulating heap of sardinella, a sardine-like fish that thrives by the billion in the Canary Current off northwest Africa.\n\nSeemingly oblivious to the smell, the rubber-booted laborers shoveled the fish into a proboscis-like chute. Armed with a giant rotating screw, the device liquidized each sardinella on contact, then sucked the resulting gray goo through a hole in the wall and into the bulky contraptions of the factory proper.\n\nThe hungry machines of Africa Prot\u00e9ine are producing fishmeal -- a nutrient-laden powder that fuels the $160 billion aquaculture industry. One of the world's fastest-growing food sectors, aquaculture is rapidly overtaking wild-capture fisheries as the biggest source of fish for human consumption.\n\nFrom the shrimp ponds of China's river deltas to the salmon cages of Norway's fjords, the industry thrives by feeding fish to other fish. Its needs are so voracious, roughly 20 percent of the world's wild-caught fish don't even go near anyone's plate but are instead ground up to make fishmeal.\n\nWith relentless demand from China pushing fishmeal prices to record highs, companies have set their sights on West Africa as a new source of supply. From state-owned conglomerates to adventurous entrepreneurs, Chinese investors are racing to build new factories on the shores of Mauritania and its two neighbors to the south, Senegal and Gambia.\n\nBut in the rush for sardinella, global business interests are snatching a staple of West Africa's diet from the people who need it the most. And the blades of the grinding machines are posing a new threat to the species at a time when climate change already has sardinella swimming for its life.\n\n\"In four or five years, there won't be any fish stocks left; the factories will close, and the foreigners will leave,\" said Abdou Karim Sall, president of an association of small-scale fishermen in Senegal known by its French acronym, Papas. \"We'll be left here without any fish.\"\n\nSatellite data indicate that the waters off northern Senegal and Mauritania are warming faster than any other part of the equator-girdling belt called the tropical convergence zone, once known to sailors simply as the \"doldrums.\" This hidden-from-view climate change has had an ominous impact: A new study by researchers at the Marseille-based institute IRD-France found that the rising temperatures have pushed sardinella an average of 200 miles north since 1995.\n\nThe findings, the results of which were shared with Reuters, provide the first clear evidence that West Africa's sardinella are joining a worldwide diaspora of sea creatures fleeing poleward or deeper as waters warm. The sheer scale of this mass migration dwarfs anything taking place on land: Fish are moving 10 times farther on average than terrestrial animals affected by rising temperatures, according to Professor Camille Parmesan, an authority on climate impacts on marine life at the University of Plymouth.\n\nClimate change is not only displacing sardinella from their traditional habitat, it's putting pressure on the fish in another, indirect way, by increasing the incentives for West African fishmeal production even further.\n\nPeru is by far the world's biggest exporter of fishmeal, manufactured from its vast shoals of anchovies. As such, the country exerts an influence on fishmeal prices comparable to Saudi Arabia's role as a swing producer of crude oil. Since the early 1970s, the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon has periodically caused catastrophic losses to Peru's gigantic anchovy catch by disrupting the upwelling mechanism that provides that fish with nutrients. In the past decade, climate change appears to have increased the frequency of El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s effects, which can in turn cause fishmeal prices to track significantly higher.\n\nThis growing volatility might bode well for West Africa's fishmeal producers, who stand to make more money each time prices spike. But overproduction could have dire consequences for millions of the region's people, by endangering the fish they depend on for their primary source of employment, income and protein.\n\nDemand for fishmeal has already caused Mauritania's annual catch of sardinella to surge from 440,000 tons to 770,000 tons within the space of a few years, according to a European Union-funded report published in 2015. Senegalese boats working under contract to the plants increased their landings tenfold between 2008 and 2012 alone, the report found. The Canary Current's fish stocks, marine scientists say, won't be able to withstand this kind of pressure for much longer.\n\nCoastal communities in West Africa are already among the populations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n\nRising seas have begun to swallow coastal villages whole, while rougher weather is making fishing ever more perilous. Droughts and irregular rainfall have forced farmers to abandon their land and head for the shore, swelling the fast-growing ranks of men whose best hope of feeding their families lies beyond the breakers.\n\nBut on the spit of land in Nouadhibou where laborers await the arrival of the next truckload of fish, factory bosses shrug their shoulders at talk of the swirling shoals of sardinella ever running out.\n\n\"Fish are still abundant,\" El-Mami said, gesturing toward a nearby beach with a grin. \"If you take your fishing rod over there now, you'll catch a beautiful fish.\"\n\nChanging fortunes\n\nPainted eyes stare from the prows of the pirogues wallowing in the surf at Joal-Fadiouth, the frenetic hub of Senegal's fishing industry. Emblazoned with the names of revered spiritual leaders whose influence permeates all tiers of Senegalese society, some also reflect more worldly aspirations: the neatly rendered crest of Manchester City football club or the words \"Barack Obama.\"\n\nA gold-rush mentality has doubled the size of the country's small-scale fishing fleet in the past decade. Eager to win votes, the government has subsidized outboard motors to allow fishermen to rove even farther. Now directly or indirectly employing 600,000 people, or 17 percent of the workforce, the fast-growing fleet is threatening to throttle the very resource that sustains it.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday, captain Doudou Kot\u00e8 clambered out of his boat and onto a cart pulled by a horse evidently at home in the waves. Borne regally through the surf in this amphibious taxi, Kot\u00e8 echoed what many of his fellow fishermen are saying: Sardinella, a talismanic species in Senegal, is in the midst of a vanishing act.\n\n\"Nowadays, there are more pirogues: People who didn't own any pirogues now own one, and people who used to own one now have two,\" said Kot\u00e8, a stout mariner who wore green waders and a conical lambskin hat. \"Often we come home without catching anything \u2014 not enough to buy fuel, or even to eat.\"\n\nA naturally jovial man with two wives and six children, Kot\u00e8's expression darkened as he predicted that pressure on sardinella would soon cause stocks of the fish to collapse. \"If I had any other job to do, I'd stop fishing,\" he said.\n\nIt's not just Senegalese who are losing out because their staple is being turned into fishmeal. In Mauritania, the industry has been grinding at least 330,000 tons of fish a year that were previously sold in West African markets such as Ghana, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, researchers estimate. That's nearly equivalent to the entire annual fish consumption of Senegal's population of 15 million.\n\nAlthough Senegal produces only a fraction of the volume of fishmeal exported by the roughly 30 Mauritanian factories, its dozen plants could pose a disproportionate risk by disrupting a delicate market mechanism that once limited how much fishermen would take.\n\nIn the past, in seasons when sardinella migrated closer to shore, Kot\u00e8 and his comrades could easily land more than the local market could absorb. Crews would dump the fish they couldn't sell to rot on the sand, then stay home until the glut passed. With the factories now willing to buy every last fish, there's nothing to stop the fishing fleet from pushing stocks to the point of collapse.\n\n\"We could face a catastrophic situation,\" said Patrice Brehmer, a marine scientist at IRD-France, who co-authored the study revealing that warming waters are pushing sardinella northward.\n\nThe growing imbalance between people and nature in the Canary Current has fishermen wondering if they will soon be forced to return to the poverty of their ancestral villages.\n\nIbrahima Samba once scratched a living by growing peanuts and millet on his family plot outside the Senegalese town of Mbour. When the rains began to arrive either too early or too late, he joined other farmers swapping their hoes for nets.\n\n\"We could see the climate changing: Things never worked out like we hoped, and there were always surprises,\" Samba said.\n\n\"With the sea, you go out today, you fish today, and you sell straight away \u2014 and you don't need to be a real professional to do it. We saw the fisherman had beautiful cars and were building houses, so we joined them.\"\n\nAfter 22 years as a fisherman, Samba says climate change is once again threatening his livelihood, this time by chasing away sardinella. \"Climate change doesn't just affect the agricultural sector, but fishing as well,\" he said. \"People who sold their land may well have problems, because there's a good chance we'll have to go back to farming.\"\n\nThe impact of the fishmeal factories is already apparent in the faces of local women. Not far from the beach at Joal-Fadiouth, lazy pillars of smoke spiraled from a complex of outdoor ovens where tightly packed rows of sardinella dried slowly over glowing cinders. Many were destined to be marinated and served on a bed of spicy rice in Senegal's national dish, known as thi\u00e9boudi\u00e8ne.\n\nWhen times were good, the thousands of workers at this outdoor fish-drying facility \u2014 almost all of them women \u2014 could make more money than the fishermen many had married, saving enough to buy them new engines, or even boats.\n\nAmong them was Rokeya Diop, a matriarchal figure of good standing among the community that dries, smokes and salts fish for sale in local markets. These days, the acrid pall hanging over the near-deserted complex matched her mood.\n\nAs Diop watched, fire-keepers still dutifully fed straw kindling into the empty ovens and used long poles to give the smoldering ashes an occasional stir. But the fishmeal factories are willing to pay twice as much as Diop and her friends can for fresh sardinella, leaving them with nothing but time on their hands.\n\n\"Each day I stay until 10 o'clock at night but I go home empty-handed,\" Diop said, slapping her palms together.\n\nAlthough demand from factories is just one of many factors affecting the availability of fish from season to season in Senegal, whispering is growing louder along the coast of more monumental changes taking place at sea.\n\n\"We can't just blame everything on the factories,\" Maimouna Diokh, the treasurer for a local council that manages fishing activity in Joal-Fadiouth, said as men loaded crates of iced fish into trucks parked in a beachside loading bay. \"Climate change is warming the waters, so there are fewer fish.\"\n\nWarming seas\n\nYears of sun and saltwater have conspired to give the Amrigue, a catamaran moored in Nouadhibou harbor, a distinctly weather-beaten aspect. But the twin-engined vessel is still seaworthy enough to ferry teams of scientists out into Greyhound Bay to gather data on the warming seas.\n\nOne Saturday, the Amrigue weighed anchor near a sandbar called Gazelle Bank, about two nautical miles from the harbor.\n\nAbdoul Dia, a laboratory chief at the Mauritanian Institute of Oceanographic Research and Fisheries, or Imrop, heaved a device used to gather sediment from the seabed off the vessel with a splash.\n\nHoisting a sample onto the deck, he dumped the gravel into a plastic tub and began rummaging through it with a sieve and hose. He was looking for micro-organisms that could help his colleagues build a more detailed picture of how conditions are changing.\n\nThe big picture is already clear: Thirty years of measurements show that the balmy waters off Mauritania are getting hotter. \"If you look, you'll see an increase in average temperature that confirms the warming trend,\" Dia said, an orange life jacket slung over his white lab coat.\n\nAt Imrop's headquarters, on a bluff overlooking the bay, Dia explained why this warming was so significant. Nouadhibou sits near a convergence zone where cooler waters to the north collide with tropical waters to the south. The precise latitude of this thermal front oscillates a little every year. But as waters have warmed, it has begun fluctuating much farther north, even roving as far as the Moroccan city of Casablanca, 870 miles away. The center of gravity of the sardinella stock has moved northward in tandem as the species has sought to maintain an optimal temperature.\n\nThe shift is good news for Mauritania's fishmeal factories, because the sardinella are now concentrated closer by. But it's bad news for fishermen to the south in Senegal and Gambia, whose lifeline fish stocks are migrating farther away.\n\nSome researchers believe that, over time, the warming trend might actually increase the abundance of fish in the Canary Current as new species find a foothold in the changing conditions. But others see a more dystopian future.\n\nVicky Lam, a fisheries economist at the Institute for Oceans and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and three researchers published a study in 2012 of the possible impact of climate change on fisheries in 14 West African nations, including Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia. Their projections for 2050 were bleak: a 21 percent drop in the annual landed value of catches, a 50 percent decline in fisheries-related jobs and an annual loss of $311 million to the regional economy.\n\nThe fishmeal industry is only adding to the pressure. Ad Corten, who chairs the sardinella committee in a stock assessment group that advises the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, said fishing vessels were taking too much from the Canary Current even before the factories came.\n\n\"This is going to burst within one or two years,\" Corten told Reuters. \"We're already noticing a scarcity of sardinella in Mauritanian waters. We hear the same stories from Senegal.\"\n\nFishermen sense that the sea's character is changing. Last year, the coldest snap off Nouadhibou in 20 years hurt catches of sardinella and octopus. Swallows migrating through the nearby dunes turned up six weeks late. The fierce wind that normally roils the ocean from March to June refused to blow. In Morocco, snow fell in the desert city of Zagora \u2014 the first in half a century.\n\n\"Last year the ocean was completely crazy,\" Abdel Aziz Boughourbal, manager of Omaurci SA, one of the biggest Mauritanian fish-processing and fishmeal companies, said over a dish of fried octopus at a waterfront restaurant where visiting sailors crack open cans of imported beer. He said a Chilean crewman on one of his vessels was astonished recently when his boat ran into a huge shoal of anchovies \u2014 the kind normally found off Peru.\n\nRush of Chinese investors\n\nSome Chinese investors don't seem to share the fishermen's fears. Over the past few years, major fishing companies have signed deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars to establish fish-processing and fishmeal plants around Nouadhibou, their giant new complexes towering above the sand. Even the port's smaller Chinese players want to expand.\n\n\"If we have the opportunity, we'll do other projects \u2014 from more fishmeal to processing and freezing,\" said Fan Yongzhen, a harried manager at Continental Seafood, one of the fishmeal factories in Nouadhibou.\n\nIn the capital, Nouakchott, the China Road and Bridge Corp., which has built giant infrastructure projects across Africa, has submitted proposals to develop a 40-square-mile marine industrial park south of the city. According to the company's feasibility study, seen by Reuters, the plant will feature facilities to process, freeze and export fish \u2014 and, of course, fishmeal.\n\nWith everyone from Chinese industrialists to Senegalese subsistence farmers looking to the Canary Current to make their fortune, tensions have started to flare.\n\nIn January, fishermen rioted in the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis after one of their colleagues was shot dead by Mauritanian coast guards. A senior coast guard official told Reuters the man was accidentally killed when an officer opened fire to try to disable the engine of a Senegalese pirogue intent on ramming the Mauritanian patrol craft.\n\nSardinella migrate across a 1,000-mile zone shared by Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia. Officials from each country insist that they want to manage their fish sustainably and develop the kind of processing, freezing and export industries that could create thousands of jobs. But with no effective regional management system yet in place, this goal may not be compatible with installing ever-more grinding machines for the benefit of fish farms producing food for Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nBamba Banja, permanent secretary to Gambia's fishing ministry, said his government's priority was to make sure local people had enough fish to eat. \"If it comes to the crunch, we would rather close the fishmeal factories and allow ordinary Gambians \u2014 women and the vulnerable \u2014 to have access to these resources,\" he said.\n\nDespite the government's assurances, the Gambian town of Gunjur has emerged as a symbol of the conflict that fishmeal can unleash.\n\nIn 2016, a Chinese industrialist opened a beachside plant called Golden Lead. Although many in Gunjur are grateful to work as porters for the factory, one of three to spring up along the tiny country's 50-mile coast, others fear that the company's demand for fishmeal is putting the community's long-term survival at risk.\n\nIn March, dozens of people assembled on the beach and dug up a pipe pouring factory effluent into the sea. Local activists accuse Golden Lead of fouling a nearby lagoon, a spawning ground and feeding area for migratory ospreys where crocodiles emerge to lounge on sandbanks in the mid-morning heat. They later showed Reuters photos of floating dead fish and an ugly red stain clouding the water.\n\nGolden Lead has since been ordered by Gambia's environment agency to extend its waste pipe 350 yards into the sea, according to an official document seen by Reuters. A few weeks after the youths dug it up, workmen arrived to make the required extension. Factory managers marked the occasion by hoisting a Chinese flag on the beach.\n\nGolden Lead says it respects Gambian regulations and has benefited the town in multiple ways, including by providing work for dozens of laborers, making improvements to a school and donating sheep to elders at Ramadan.\n\n\"We are a business,\" said a member of staff, who declined to be named. \"If we didn't do it, somebody else will come.\"\n\nLamin Jassey, an English teacher, played a leading role in the protests against Golden Lead. He is among a small group of activists who have since been charged with criminal damage, trespass and \"intimidating and annoying\" the company. He had to post an $8,400 bail \u2014 almost 20 times the annual average income in Gambia.\n\n\"Today Gunjur is booming \u2014 we have a lot of fishermen. We have thousands of others coming from Senegal,\" he said, watching as porters waded waist-deep into the water to unload fish to carry to the factory door. \"But if the fish stock is under pressure, and at the end it's very scarce, what do you think about the future?\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Taiwan's 'Notebook Boy' Commits His Memories in Writing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-notebook-boy-commits-his-memories-in-writing/4674673.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Chen Hong-zhi's notebooks are his life.\n\nNine years ago, Chen seriously damaged his hippocampus, a part of the brain associated with forming memories, in a traffic accident.\n\nThe 26-year-old has lost the ability to make and retain short-term memories.

Its full-scale skeleton on display in the museum is almost eight meters long.\n\nIn addition to top predators like the monster-like mosasaur, the exhibit also includes fossils of gentler creatures; small fish and an ancient giant sea turtle.\n\n\u201cWe have a snapshot of this moment in time 72 million years ago that has preserved all of these animals that were living together in one place,\u201d Polcyn said.\n\nThe big dig\n\nJacobs says the fossil find in Angola was a big deal for a number of reasons:\n\n\u201cFirst of all because it's going into a country that never really had a heritage of fossils,\u201d he said. \u201cIt basically was unknown at the level that we are opening it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cFossils,\u201d he says, \u201cinstill a sense of pride in what\u2019s in the country, and it provides something to use for education, and it builds science. And the way it builds science is because every country has fossils, so every country has something to offer, so every country is a piece of the puzzle and the Angola piece is now there.\u201d\n\nMichael Polcyn agrees that unearthing this cache of ancient fossils has been a huge breakthrough on a number of fronts.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely scientific point of view it gives us an incredible window into an ecosystem 72 million years ago that is relatively complete,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom a very human point of view this really shows the people of Angola, and the people of the world, what incredible resources we have in our natural environments.\u201d\n\nAnd lastly, he says, \u201cThese fossils are the patrimony of Angola, these are their heritage, and for us to be able to bring them to the Smithsonian and ultimately back to Angola, on a very personal level, is a thrill for us.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "China Orders Probe After Scientist Claims 1st Gene-Edited Babies", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/first-gene-edited-babies-claimed-in-china/4674145.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Chinese health and medical ethics authorities started an investigation on Monday into claims by a scientist who released videos on YouTube saying he had altered the genes of twins born earlier this month, creating the first gene edited babies.\n\nThe Southern University of Science and Technology in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, where the scientist, He Jiankui, holds an associate professorship, said it had been unaware of the research project and that He had been on leave without pay since February.\n\nHe Jiankui defended what he claimed to have achieved, saying he had performed the gene editing to help protect the babies from future infection with the AIDS virus.\n\nBut his university said it was a \"serious violation of academic ethics and standards\" and scientists around the world condemned it as monstrous and dangerous.\n\nThe university issued a statement after He said in five videos posted on Monday that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the genes of twin girls.\n\nChina's National Health Commission said it was \"highly concerned\" and had ordered provincial health officials \"to immediately investigate and clarify the matter\".\n\n\"We have to be responsible for the people's health and will act on this according to the law,\" it said in a statement.\n\nShenzhen's medical ethics committee said it was investigating the case.

That 1977 ruling limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others.\n\nApple was backed by Republican President Donald Trump's administration. Some liberal and conservative justices sharply questioned an attorney for Apple and U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of the administration on the company's side, over their argument that the consumers were not directly affected by purchasing the apps from Apple.\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan, explaining how an App Store purchase is handled, said, \"From my perspective, I've engaged in a one-step transaction with Apple.\"\n\nSome conservative justices, including Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, wondered whether the 1977 ruling was still valid in a modern marketplace.\n\nConservative Chief Justice John Roberts' questions suggested he agreed with Apple's position. Roberts expressed concern that, for a single price increase, Apple could be held liable by both consumers and App developers.\n\nThe iPhone users, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, have argued that Apple's monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources.\n\nThough developers set the prices of their apps, Apple collects the payments from iPhone users, keeping a 30 percent commission on each purchase. One area of dispute in the case is whether app developers recoup the cost of that commission by passing it on to consumers. Developers earned more than $26 billion in 2017, a 30 percent increase over 2016, according to Apple.\n\nClosing courthouse doors\n\nApple, also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, told the justices in legal papers that siding with the iPhone users who filed the lawsuit would threaten the burgeoning field of e-commerce, which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in U.S. retail sales.\n\nThe plaintiffs, as well as antitrust watchdog groups, said closing courthouse doors to those who buy end products would undermine antitrust enforcement and allow monopolistic behavior to expand unchecked. The plaintiffs were backed by 30 state attorneys general, including from Texas, California and New York.\n\nThe plaintiffs said app developers would be unlikely to sue Apple, which controls the service where they make money, leaving no one to challenge anti-competitive conduct.\n\nThe company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to bring the lawsuit. A federal judge in Oakland, California threw out the suit, saying the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers.\n\nBut the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case last year, finding that Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Here's What Happened In Russia And Ukraine's Naval Clash", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ukraine-russia-martial-law-naval-clash_us_5bfc5674e4b0eb6d93129295", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Sergei Malgavko via Getty Images The Kerch Strait, near where Russia seized three Ukrainian military ships this weekend.

Ukraine\u2019s government declared martial law on Monday in response to the attack, and the incident led to public protests and international condemnations of Russia.\n\nThe naval clash is one of the most significant events in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s hostilities since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, potentially setting up further conflict if tensions aren\u2019t brought under control.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the incident and its fallout:\n\nRussia Seizes Ukrainian Military Ships\n\nRussia and Ukraine have differing versions of events, and each one blames the other for instigating the incident.

Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty in 2003 that allows the two countries full access to the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, but Russian coast guard vessels on Sunday moved to stop the Ukrainian ships from passing through the strait. A Russian ship rammed a Ukrainian military tugboat before coast guard vessels opened fire on the two Ukrainian gunships it was accompanying.\n\nA video taken aboard the Ukrainian tugboat captured the start of the attack:\n\nAll three Ukrainian ships were badly damaged and six of their crew were wounded, according to Ukraine\u2019s military, which said Russia then seized the ships and detained 23 Ukrainian crew members. Russia, however, claimed that only three Ukrainians were lightly injured, and accused Ukraine and \u201cits Western patrons\u201d of provoking the attack as \u201cpretext for stepping up sanctions\u201d against the Kremlin. There is also dispute between the two countries over whether Ukraine notified Russia in advance about the ships passing through the strait, with Moscow denying Kiev\u2019s statement that its military alerted the Russian forces multiple times of its intentions.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what will happen to the Ukrainian crew members whom Russia is holding captive. The status of the damaged ships is unknown, and it\u2019s likewise not clear whether Russia will take further action to block access to the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe Dispute Over A Valuable Sea\n\nTensions over both the Kerch Strait and access to the Sea of Azov have been building ever since Russia annexed Crimea, a seizure that gave the Kremlin de facto military control of the strait. About half of Ukraine\u2019s coastline is on the Azov Sea, and many of its shipping routes go through the strait, which means Russia has power over a crucial bottleneck.\n\nIn the past year, the dispute over access to the sea has intensified. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of military buildups and illegal activity in the area, with Kiev alleging that the Russians were preventing ships from passing through the strait. Ukraine also condemned the opening of a multibillion-dollar bridge in May that spans the strait to connect Russia and Crimea. Last month, Ukraine announced it would build a new military base on the Azov Sea to counter the Russian presence.\n\nThe increasingly fraught situation around the sea has unfolded in parallel to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting in recent years between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian military has killed more than 10,000 people. Russia has denied direct involvement in that conflict \u2015 but one of the things that makes Sunday\u2019s incident so notable is that the Kremlin has made no attempt to hide its hostile actions.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Petro Poroshenko addresses the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nMartial Law And What Happens Next\n\nThere are a number of big questions about where the crisis goes from here, and whether the international community can de-escalate the situation. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the incident, while a number of Western nations and NATO officials criticized Russia for aggression and violating international law.\n\nUkraine\u2019s government has declared a 30-day period of martial law, a move that gives authorities sweeping powers to limit freedoms in the country. Ukraine\u2019s parliament approved the measures late on Monday, after President Petro Poroshenko called on lawmakers to support the move. It is the first time Ukraine has imposed martial law since its conflict with Russia began in 2014, and it could have major domestic implications.\n\nSome of Poroshenko\u2019s critics allege that the measures are a political ploy to shore up support for his presidency. His approval ratings have fallen in recent months, and he faces the likelihood of being voted out of office in the country\u2019s presidential elections in March. Declaring martial law could potentially allow Poroshenko to postpone the vote and rally more support through anti-Kremlin appeals.\n\nAfter the naval clash on Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kiev to demonstrate. An embassy car was set aflame. Far-right protesters also gathered outside Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Monday, demanding strong action against Russia and waving nationalist banners."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Uganda Party Boat Accident On Lake Victoria Leaves At Least 33 Dead", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uganda-party-boat-lake-victoria_us_5bfbf08de4b0771fb6bb7ba7", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "KAMPALA (Reuters) \u2015 The death toll from a boat accident on Lake Victoria over the weekend rose to 33 on Monday, Ugandan police said, as survivors described moments of heavy drinking and raucous fun before the vessel, slammed by powerful waves, tilted and sank.\n\nThe Saturday evening tragedy occurred hundreds of feet off shore as the boat, carrying an estimated 100 partygoers, was en route from one beach to another in Mukono district near the capital Kampala.\n\nPolice spokesman, Patrick Onyango said the number of bodies retrieved from the water stood at 33 on Monday while 27 people have been rescued alive.

The historic temple, which had barred women age 10 to 50 from entering, opened to Hindu pilgrims for a day. The last time it was opened, conservative protesters blocked women of menstruating age from going to the temple, defying a recent ruling from India's top court to let them enter.\n\n\u201cHuffPost Her Stories\u201d is a new series highlighting HuffPost\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s lives from across our 15 global editions.

It was a groundbreaking but deeply controversial decision, and still no woman has entered the shrine to Lord Ayyappa in the southern state of Kerala. Violent protesters blocked the first women who attempted the steep trek to the hillside Sabarimala temple complex. The threats followed the women back home, where some even encountered violence, HuffPost India reported.\n\nIncredibly, none of this has deterred hundreds of other women from registering to visit the holy site during the ongoing pilgrimage season. HuffPost India\u2019s Chithira Vijayakumar spoke with three of them \u2014 a young developer, a housewife and school teacher \u2014 about their decisions to embark on the risky journey.\n\n\u201cThese interviews, and subsequent interactions I\u2019ve had with other women who plan to climb, challenge two of the dominant narratives that exist vis-\u00e0-vis the Sabarimala issue,\u201d Chithira explained. \u201cThe first is the straw feminist argument that the women who want to make the climb are only doing it to \u2018prove a point.\u2019 ... The second one is that this is a plan masterminded by the Left, to destroy the sanctity of Sabarimala, and part of a larger ploy to attack and weaken Hindu faith.\u201d\n\nThe framing of the conflict as one between true devotees and godless feminist activists, Chithira said, is \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor one, the original case for the entry of women was filed as a public interest litigation by a few members of the Indian Young Lawyers Association, and not a feminist organization,\u201d she said. \u201cSecondly, the women who are observing the fast to visit the forest shrine seem to be motivated by a genuine curiosity about the effects of pilgrimage, as well as an abiding sense of faith.\u201c\n\nChithira\u2019s piece is an engrossing read about faith and courage in the face of intimidation, as well as the complex views the devout have about women and tradition.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nJo Hale via Getty Images Pop group Little Mix has released an unapologetically feminist album.\n\nThe biggest female pop group in the U.K. has used its platform to send empowering messages to its young female fan base for years.

It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nEarlier that year Wolikow had been laid off from the General Motors plant in Lordstown, where he\u2019d worked since 2008. He had high hopes that the plant might once again ramp up production and call him back. The president bolstered those hopes.\n\n\u201cI believed what he said, and at that moment it turned me into a Trump supporter,\u201d Wolikow said. \u201cIt made me feel that he wasn\u2019t lying and he was being honest.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, GM announced the plant would be \u201cunallocated.\u201d If the Lordstown jobs are coming back, it\u2019s not happening soon.\n\nThe company has been dialing down production at the Lordstown plant since 2017 primarily because of weak demand for the Chevrolet Cruze manufactured there. Thanks in part to low gas prices, Americans have been buying more SUVs and crossovers (like the Honda CR-V) than smaller cars like the Cruze.\n\n\u201cIn the past four years, GM has refocused capital and resources to support the growth of its crossovers, SUVs and trucks, adding shifts and investing $6.6 billion in U.S. plants that have created or maintained 17,600 jobs,\u201d the company said Monday. It announced that two other plants, in Detroit and Ontario, Canada, would also be shut down. Several thousand factory workers are expected to lose their jobs.\n\nWolikow, 36, had hoped either that consumers would change their minds about the Cruze or that GM would repurpose the plant to make the Chevy Blazer. Instead, the company said this year it would make the Blazer in Mexico.\n\nTrump said Monday that he was unhappy about the Lordstown plant stopping production, and that GM should use the factory for another car.\n\n\u201cThey say the Chevy Cruze is not selling well. I say, \u2018Well then, get a car that is selling well and put it back in,\u2019\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House. \u201cI have no doubt that in the not-too-distant future, they\u2019ll put something else. They better put something else in.\u201d\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise of protecting American manufacturing workers from cheaper foreign labor, but so far his trade agenda has not stopped companies from making moves that are unfavorable to their U.S. employees.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who represents the area, said Trump should keep his word about jobs coming back to the Mahoning Valley.\n\n\u201cSo far, President Trump has been asleep at the switch and owes this community an explanation,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cHe promised us that his massive corporate tax cut would lead to dramatic reinvestments in our communities. That clearly is not happening.\u201d\n\nThe United Auto Workers union said it would fight GM\u2019s decision to close the plants. UAW Vice President Terry Dittes called the decision \u201cprofoundly damaging to our American workforce.\u201d\n\nBy the end of this summer, Wolikow\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump had faded, so much so that he attended counter-rallies organized by Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed worker advocacy group that has been calling attention to U.S. companies\u2019 habit of offshoring American jobs.\n\nWolikow said he\u2019s got three kids, and that he and his fiancee, who works at a Cracker Barrel, are racking up credit card debt just to pay for basic living expenses. He said he\u2019s applied for dozens of jobs with no luck, even though he\u2019s gotten a trucking license and a diesel mechanic certification."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amanda Bynes Opens Up About Drug-Fueled Downfall In New Interview", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amanda-bynes-paper-magazine_us_5bfc6d10e4b0771fb6bd14ac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "After shying away from the public eye for a few years, Amanda Bynes opened up about her past \u2015 and her present \u2015 in the annual \u201cBreak the Internet\u201d issue of Paper Magazine.\n\nThe former child star spoke about her struggles with drug use and added that she didn\u2019t start partying until she was 25 \u2015 and never really drank alcohol.\n\n\u201cI started smoking marijuana when I was 16,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get addicted [then] and I wasn\u2019t abusing it.

The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that\u2019s causing problems.\n\nAll of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.\n\nInstead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.\n\nHe recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym \u201cBai Hua,\u201d told the AP that it\u2019s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.\n\nHere is how He described the work:\n\nThe gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was \u201cwashed\u201d to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.\n\nWhen the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.\n\nTests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.\n\nSeveral scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.\n\nThey also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like not editing at all\u201d if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.\n\nChurch and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.\n\n\u201cIn that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you\u2019re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,\u201d Musunuru said.\n\nThe use of that embryo suggests that the researchers\u2019 \u201cmain emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,\u201d Church said.\n\nEven if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it\u2019s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.\n\nThere also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it \u2014 on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an \u201cAIDS vaccine development\u201d program.\n\nThe Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d thinks they were able to understand the risks.\n\nDeem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.\n\n\u201cThat might be a layman\u2019s way of describing it,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.\n\nThe Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks.

But do you find yourself on the cold side all the time? Are you constantly fighting with your significant other over the thermostat? Wearing a jacket when your pals are comfortably rocking t-shirts? And continuously plastered with goosebumps?\n\nThere are specific factors that can help to explain why you are always so cold. Here are some expert-backed explanations, plus what you can do about them:\n\n1. Your thyroid is out of wack\n\nHypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland is under-active, may be to blame, according to Chirag Shah, a board-certified emergency medicine physician and co-founder of Accesa Labs, a thyroid lab-testing service. While the gland is responsible for a number of metabolic processes, it\u2019s also involved with temperature regulation in the body.\n\n\u201cPeople with hypothyroidism often feel cold because they do not make enough thyroid hormone. The result is that the metabolism slows down, resulting in the sensation of feeling cold,\u201d Shah said.\n\n2. You\u2019re older\n\n\u201cThe elderly can be more prone to being cold because their metabolism is slower and they produce less heat,\u201d said Marcelo Campos, an internal medicine doctor at Atrius Health, a large nonprofit independent medical group based in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nYour normal body functions may also decline the more you age.\n\n\u201cStudies show that from around the age of 60, the ability of our bodies to conserve heat declines, resulting in more cold sensation,\u201d said Dawne Kort, an attending physician and partner at CityMD, New York-based urgent care provider. And as you get older, you can experience decreased muscle mass, which can also play into this.\n\nLumina Images via Getty Images\n\n3. It could be something you\u2019re eating\n\nJosh Axe, a clinical nutritionist and founder of Ancient Nutrition and DrAxe.com, said that certain foods may be to blame.\n\n\u201cPeople who eat lots of water-dense, cold foods are going to feel cooler,\u201d he said. Examples of these are smoothies, iced drinks and salads. To combat this, try switching to items like soups instead of smoothies and stir-fry meals in lieu of salads.\n\n4. You\u2019re anemic\n\nShah said that iron deficiency anemia can definitely cause a person to feel more frigid than usual, noting that iron is a mineral that is a key component of red blood cells.\n\n\u201cRed blood cells are important for carrying oxygen around the body. Without enough iron, the red blood cells cannot function properly and can lead to the sensation of feeling cold in addition to other symptoms,\u201d Shah said.\n\nAdditional signs of anemia include: feeling tired, lightheaded, experiencing a rapid heart rate or shortness of breath.\n\nJacqueline Jacques, the senior vice president of medical affairs at Thorne Research, a nutritional supplement and at-home health testing brand, said anemia can also be caused by having low levels of B12. This can be an issue for vegetarians or vegans, as foods rich in the vitamin include eggs, poultry, meat, and dairy.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images\n\n5. You\u2019re pregnant\n\nGenerally, body temperature goes up in pregnancy. Jacques said that normal core temperature rises from 98.6 to around 100 when a woman is carrying a child.\n\n\u201cThat said, pregnant women are both more likely to have anemia and poor circulation, especially in their legs,\u201d she said. So pregnant women may occasionally complain about feeling like they have a chill, especially in their hands and feet.\n\n6. You\u2019re dehydrated\n\nCarol Aguirre with Nutrition Connections, a nutrition counseling center in South Florida, said that water drives the metabolism by helping break down food, which creates energy and heat.\n\n\u201cNot enough water slows your metabolism and prevents your body from making enough energy to keep you warm,\u201d she said.\n\nPeter Muller via Getty Images\n\n7. It could be your hormones\n\nDifferent hormones produced by males and females can affect body temperature, according to experts.\n\nFor example, \u201cestrogen generally promotes dilated blood vessels, heat dissipation, and lower body temperature,\u201d Kort said. \u201cProgesterone, or progestins, generally has the opposite effect.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, depending on a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle and hormone levels, changes in body temperature and cold sensitivity can occur. \u201cIn men, higher testosterone levels may reduce sensitivity to the cold by desensitizing one of the main cold receptors in the skin,\u201d Kort added.\n\n8. Women tend to be colder than men\n\nA study by the University of Utah found that women\u2019s hands tend to run consistently colder than those of males. And according to Jacques, women are more prone to both anemia and hypothyroidism, which are both linked to coldness.\n\n9. You have poor circulation\n\nIf your hands and feet feel like ice but the rest of your body is comfortable, a circulation problem that keeps blood from flowing to your extremities might be to blame. Kort said cardiovascular disease can be one cause.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that your heart is not pumping blood effectively or that an artery blockage could be preventing blood from getting to your extremities,\u201d she said. \u201cSmoking can also bring on circulation issues, as smoking constricts blood vessels.\u201d\n\nArtur Debat via Getty Images\n\n10. Your anxiety may be to blame\n\n\u201cPeople with anxiety usually feel cold more than others,\u201d said Maryam Jahed, founder and COO of the anxiety-tracking wearable device Airo Health.\n\nShe added that this occurs because when you\u2019re experiencing anxiety, the feeling activates your amygdala \u2015 the part of the brain responsible for protecting the body and responding to danger. \u201cThis makes your body put all of its reserves and energy into keeping you \u2018safe,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nJahed also said this can make you feel cold because your body is focusing on calming you down and therefore does not have enough blood flow to keep you warm. \u201cThat\u2019s why you usually feel colder in your extremities. It\u2019s harder for blood to reach there and keep you warm,\u201d she said.\n\n11. Your BMI is too low\n\nYour body mass index or weight affect whether you feel cold, but the amount of fat and muscle you have are also factors.\n\n\u201cMuscles are metabolically more active and this generates more heat. Fat is an insulator and this can reduce the amount of heat you lose,\u201d Campos said.\n\nConversely, rapid weight loss or a restricted diet may be to blame for feeling cold. Jacques said that since your body burns calories to make heat, \u201cwhen you restrict calories, you are literally reducing the fuel that keeps your body warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, our bodies are programmed to try to prevent starvation. If you severely restrict calories or reduce your weight too quickly, especially with crash diets or eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia, then your body will try to save you from starving by slowing down your metabolism \u2015 which means you are not burning as much energy so you feel cold,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen To Be Concerned\n\nIf you are tired and run down from having a virus or being really overworked, you may experience feeling cold as just a temporary symptom from your body being over stressed. But if you notice that you are substantially colder than people around you on a regular basis, or you never used to feel cold and now you are cold all the time, you should see a doctor.\n\nIf you have a new symptom of coldness together with other symptoms like weight gain or loss, fatigue, rapid heart rate, hair loss, constipation or shortness of breath, then you should see a qualified health professional as well, Jacques said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Here's How Different Types Of Coffee Drinks Impact Your Body And Brain", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coffee-drinks-espresso-affects-body-brain_us_5bed8ff7e4b03af89267a915", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Guido Mieth via Getty Images\n\nIf you\u2019re a coffee drinker, you know there\u2019s nothing more blissful than that first sip of hot (or iced) coffee in the morning. Sure, it tastes delicious, but that\u2019s the least of it: With coffee running through your veins, you suddenly feel energized enough to take on the day ahead.\n\nMost studies have found that coffee is also pretty good for your health. As long as you\u2019re not overdoing it (by that we mean more than six cups per day), coffee has been correlated with decreased risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes. And some research has found it could even decrease your risk of depression.\n\nSo we know \u2014 thankfully \u2014 that most of us don\u2019t have to give up coffee. But most coffee drinkers have tipped over into uncomfortable territory at one point or another, whether that means the jitters, spikes in anxiety or a stomachache. And it never feels great.\n\nIf you\u2019re on a mission to enjoy your favorite comforting, steaming-hot beverage without the negative side effects, read on \u2014 because we may just have some answers for you.\n\nLet\u2019s Talk About Caffeine\n\nFirst and foremost, everybody\u2019s body is different, and we all metabolize caffeine differently. So while one person may be able to drink four cups of coffee after lunch, feel great and get an excellent night of sleep, another person might drink a smaller amount first thing in the morning, suffer a massive case of the jitters and stay up all night.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to figure out exactly how you react to coffee until you try it, but most people can experience some not-so-great side effects from the caffeine \u2015 like the jitters, insomnia, a racing heart or even a full-blown panic attack.\n\n\u201cCaffeine has several physiological effects on the body, one of the most potent being its ability to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to produce adrenaline from your adrenal glands,\u201d nutritionist Tamar Samuels told HuffPost. \u201cAdrenaline is a powerful hormone that is part of the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response. The release of adrenaline into the bloodstream increases blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, all of which may contribute to the jittery feeling some get when they consume too much coffee.\u201d\n\nAs a general rule, the higher the caffeine content in your coffee, the more likely you are to experience these symptoms. Interestingly, while we may associate espresso shots with a jolt of caffeine, two shots (which is a standard serving for many coffee shops) actually has significantly less caffeine (about 150 mg) than a 16-ounce cup of Starbucks coffee (at 330 mg).\n\nIf you\u2019re a cold brew fan, you\u2019re getting 200 mg of caffeine from Starbucks\u2019 standard 16-ounce cup. If you\u2019ve hopped on the nitro brew train, you\u2019re looking at caffeine content that\u2019s similar to that of drip coffee: 325 mg for a 16-ounce cup.\n\nWhat About Acidity?\n\nWhile the biggest indicator of how coffee will make your body and brain feel is caffeine, if you\u2019ve ever struggled with stomach problems while drinking coffee, acid content could be the culprit.\n\n\u201cPeople with inflamed esophageal, stomach and/or intestinal tissues may be especially sensitive to higher acid drinks like coffee because the acidity from coffee drinks can cause a burning sensation upon exposure to sensitive tissue,\u201d Samuels said.\n\nIf that sounds like you, consider opting for coffee drinks that are less acidic.\n\n\u201cOne study found that espresso, French roast and other dark-roasted coffees may be less irritating because they contain a compound \u2014 N-methylpyridium, which is only produced during roasting \u2014 that inhibits stomach acid production,\u201d said Samuels.\n\nThat Triple-Shot Caramel Coffee Thing ...\n\nAnother thing that complicates coffee? All the stuff we add to it. For example, pouring a lot of milk into your coffee could increase its acidity.\n\nWe\u2019re also adding sugar, artificial sugar, butter, MCT oil \u2014 and all of that is affecting our bodies and brains in one way or another.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Bulletproof coffee [which is supposed to be made with butter and MCT oil], MCTs may increase metabolism and improve mental clarity, but can also cause indigestion,\u201d Samuels explained.\n\n\u201cCoffee drinks with added sugars can cause weight gain and potentially increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really all comes down to the individual and what works for their body.\u201d\n\nCoffee Alternatives To Try\n\nIf you find that coffee simply doesn\u2019t jibe with your body, that\u2019s OK \u2014 there are tons of options out there that are just as delicious and can provide a little caffeine jolt without the side effects. Matcha, for example, delivers caffeine and a compound called L-theanine, which produces a feeling of \u201ccalm alertness\u201d in the body.\n\nIf you like the taste of coffee but don\u2019t do well with caffeine, nutritionist Stacy Leung suggests trying chicory root. \u201cChicory root is an herb that tastes similar to coffee when brewed and is naturally caffeine free,\u201d she told HuffPost."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "The Most Important Tool For Doctors Fighting DRC's Ebola Crisis Isn't Medicine", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-ebola-drc-trust_us_5bf57664e4b0eb6d930a81e5", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "My experience as a public health practitioner has convinced me that a lack of trust has become a critical driver of modern epidemics. We are seeing this unfold right now in the Ebola epidemic raging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2015 an epidemic that has been declared the worst in the country\u2019s history.\n\nTrust is the most important part of the doctor-patient relationship. I know that if I lose my patients\u2019 trust, it will be impossible for me to effectively treat them. In order to establish a trusting relationship, I must understand my patients as more than just their diseases\u2014I must understand them within the complex fabric of their social, political, religious and cultural belief systems.\n\nI do this while they are healthy, so when illness does strike they can trust me to make the right decision for them. International responders\u2019 failure to locate the DRC\u2019s current Ebola epidemic within the country\u2019s larger social, political, religious and cultural belief systems is precisely why trust was so weak when they arrived weeks ago to deploy vaccines and begin tracking the infection.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen this happen before. During the West African Ebola epidemic of 2014, a lack of community trust helped allow the virus to evolve into a pandemic, killing more than 11,000 people over two years and spreading overseas. Many international public health experts were blindsided by local community members\u2019 hesitancy and fear. West Africans went so far as to hide their funeral services from international Ebola treatment teams; funerals are now thought to be one of the most important modes of transmission between dead victims and family members later infected.\n\nMany West Africans turned to the familiar \u2014 traditional healers \u2014 rather than seeking modern medical treatment. Ultimately, anthropologists were deployed to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural nuances that needed stronger appreciation before the right interventions could be designed for specific communities. From this research, we learned that trust is the vehicle by which epidemic responses are executed effectively.\n\nYet that same lesson is catching us off-guard once again. In the North Kivu, an already awful situation is worsening, fueled by mistrust and conspiracy fears. Civilians are questioning if Ebola is possibly a political tool being used by opposition parties to alter upcoming elections. As a result, they are avoiding not just vaccinations but also testing and treatment. This means efforts at keeping track of who is infected \u2015 and vaccinating those who have come into contact with an infected individual \u2015 are failing. And the mistrust is not only directed at international responders \u2014 many locals don\u2019t trust the DRC government, either.\n\nWorse yet is that we knew this was coming. Conspiracies like these also plagued the last Ebola epidemic. In Liberia, civilians questioned if Ebola was a Western ploy to infect Africans; others wondered if Ebola was artificially created to sell vaccines to the poor.\n\nIf I was approached by a doctor with whom I didn\u2019t already have a therapeutic relationship and was told to take a pill or a shot, I\u2019d be understandably hesitant.\n\nWhen I put myself in the mind of the patient, I am not surprised by any of this. If I was approached by a doctor with whom I didn\u2019t already have a therapeutic relationship and was told to take a pill or a shot, I\u2019d be understandably hesitant. Trust must be established before \u2014 not after \u2014 a disease infects an individual or ravages a country.\n\nIf public health efforts emphasized the building of ground-level trust when communities are predominately healthy (the same way I establish rapport with my patients over many years), we\u2019d see responders and community members working together when an epidemic strikes. This would prevent a few cases from becoming hundreds or thousands.\n\nEpidemics require quick action, but we cannot cut corners when it comes to understanding a community\u2019s knowledge, attitudes and practices before employing interventions. What does the community understand about Ebola? What types of experiences are driving their belief systems? How can we best work within those systems to identify misunderstandings at their roots?\n\nFrom there, how can we work with community leaders to best teach people in a way that is culturally appropriate and locally understood? That same thoughtful approach must be taken when it comes to vaccines, diagnostics and treatment.\n\nTake vaccines, for example. U.S. physicians are very familiar with vaccine hesitancy. Almost every day, at least a handful of my patients refuse to get the flu vaccine. They often recount personal experiences in which they received the vaccine and still got sick that year. Some mistakenly believe the vaccine actually caused their flu.\n\nThis means I must take the time to explain that not every upper respiratory infection is the flu, and that the flu vaccine may very well have lessened symptoms that would have otherwise been much worse. Even then, my patients don\u2019t always agree, but we continue to have a rapport that allows me to treat them for other conditions.\n\nThe same is likely to happen with Ebola. Some patients may be amenable to vaccination, some to treatment, some to testing and some to none of these. Nonetheless, public health responders must use every opportunity to build rapport, establish trust and prove to communities that they are there in the best interests of the community\u2019s health.\n\nBuilding trust with my patients has allowed me to convince people to undergo treatments that ultimately saved their lives. This trust was earned, not given. It required me to understand my patients at a very human level, and it required me to lose many battles to ultimately win the larger war.\n\nThe same must happen with our response to epidemics. We may not convince every single person to do everything we ask, but if we can convince a community to trust that we are there because we are concerned about them as people \u2014 not just as transmitters of disease \u2014 we will begin to see a very different response."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Announces New Headquarters In Virginia, New York City", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-hq2-new-york-virginia-queens_us_5beae68fe4b0783e0a1c8db0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "SEATTLE \u2015 Amazon today announced that it has selected New York City and Arlington, Virginia, as the locations for the company\u2019s new headquarters.\n\nAmazon will invest $5 billion and create more than 50,000 jobs across the two new headquarters locations, with more than 25,000 employees each in New York City and Arlington.\n\nThe new locations will join Seattle as the company\u2019s three headquarters in North America.

Among the questions were inquiries about what Mr. Trump knew about Russian offers to Mr. Manafort during the campaign to assist Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The president\u2019s lawyers have declined to discuss what he told Mr. Mueller, and it is not clear whether any of his answers conflicted with what Mr. Manafort told investigators.\n\nMr. Manafort\u2019s allies have hoped that his sessions with the special counsel would end soon so he could be sentenced and transferred to a federal prison, where conditions are comparatively better than in a local jail. At a recent court hearing in Alexandria, Mr. Manafort came into the courtroom in a wheelchair, his foot wrapped in a white bandage, possibly from an attack of gout.\n\nBut few of Mr. Manafort\u2019s friends predicted that his sentencing would be hastened by prosecutors declaring him to be a liar.

He won few points by calling Mr. Trump \u201cDonald\u201d in his first CNN appearance, as if he were Mr. Trump\u2019s peer. Some aides suggested he was unfamiliar with all the changes in politics \u2014 most notably the rise of the internet \u2014 since 1996, when he last worked on an American presidential campaign. Others described him as lazy, carefully noting when he took off on Fridays for the Hamptons. Mr. Manafort said he had built a television studio at his home there so he could appear on Sunday talk shows remotely.\n\nHe lasted only five months, three of them as campaign chairman. When The New York Times revealed that a ledger found by Ukrainian investigators had listed $12.7 million in off-the-books cash payments to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm, one former campaign aide said that Mr. Trump was enraged. But another article detailing how Mr. Manafort and others were begging Mr. Trump to stop picking public fights equally angered Mr. Trump. When Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told Mr. Manafort he was out, Mr. Trump was barely speaking to him.\n\nBy then, Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial house of cards was on the verge of collapse. Less than two weeks after he left the campaign, one lender informed him that it had started to foreclose on his Brooklyn brownstone. He had paid cash for it when he was financially flush four years earlier, then borrowed $5.3 million against it that February. Five months had passed with no payments.\n\nMr. Gates managed to retain his affiliation to Mr. Trump as a liaison between the campaign and the Republican National Committee, although Mr. Trump disliked him so much that he was barred from flying on the candidate\u2019s private plane. Mr. Manafort tried to use his lingering connection to Mr. Trump to land consulting work and to persuade banks to bail him out. He dangled a possible cabinet secretary post in front of Stephen Calk, chairman of Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, pressing Mr. Gates to promote him as a possible secretary of the Army.\n\nHe continued to treat Mr. Gates as his aide, asking him how to convert profit-and-loss statements from PDF format into Word in order, prosecutors said, to inflate his income and appear more creditworthy to banks. After the election, Mr. Calk approved two loans to Mr. Manafort for a total of $16 million. Mr. Manafort used some of it to save his Brooklyn property from foreclosure.\n\nBut even Mr. Calk was getting worried. On Dec. 7, 2016, he wrote to another top bank official: \u201cNervousness is setting in.\u201d Less than a year later, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team filed the first of a series of indictments against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Mueller granted a plea deal to Mr. Gates and immunity from prosecution to five of the nearly dozen witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Manafort celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary in jail. He was allowed three visits limited to 30 minutes each.

The last permanent shutdown of a plant in the United States came in 2016 when Mitsubishi Motors shuttered one in Normal, Ill. Before that, Ford closed a truck plant in St. Paul in 2011.\n\nMore typically since rebounding from the recession, carmakers and their suppliers have restarted shuttered plants, adding new ones across the South and hiring tens of thousands of workers a year.\n\nBut demand for small and midsize cars has plunged. Two-thirds of all new vehicles sold last year were trucks and S.U.V.s. That shift has hit G.M.\u2019s Lordstown plant hard. Just a few years ago, the factory employed three shifts of workers to churn out Chevy Cruzes. Now it is down to one. In 2017 the plant made about 180,000 cars, down from 248,000 in 2013.\n\nMore broadly, the yearslong boom in car and truck sales in North America appears to be ending, said John Hoffecker, vice chairman at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm with a large automotive practice. \u201cSales have held up well this year, but we do see a downturn coming,\u201d he said. AlixPartners forecast that domestic auto sales will fall to about 15 million cars and light trucks in 2020, from about 17 million this year.\n\nEven though they are facing a potential slump, carmakers continue to spend heavily to develop electric vehicles and self-driving technology, both to meet regulatory mandates and to anticipate the future of driving. That shift is expected to remake the global industry and enable companies to enter new and potentially lucrative businesses, such as driverless taxi and delivery services.\n\nAt the same time, automakers have had to contend with a new political agenda in Washington. One benefit has been the corporate tax cuts enacted last year. The changes, championed by Mr. Trump and his party, saved G.M. $157 million in federal taxes in the first nine months of the year, according to the company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Pain and Sense of Betrayal as Canada G.M.

We\u2019ve been married for 15 years, we had a lot of memories in the home that we just didn\u2019t have enough time to get.\n\nAfter leaving his house, Captain Chavez found people frozen in fear on the street, staring at the flames.

At a recent court hearing in Alexandria, Mr. Manafort came into the courtroom in a wheelchair, his foot wrapped in a white bandage, possibly from an attack of gout.\n\nBut few of Mr. Manafort\u2019s friends predicted that his sentencing would be hastened by prosecutors declaring him to be a liar. The development stunned some people close to the White House, as well as legal experts.\n\n\u201cEverybody who lies to Mueller gets called on it \u2014 so he had to know that Mueller would catch him. So the question is: What was he hiding that is worse than going to jail for the rest of your life?\u201d said Joyce Vance, a professor of law at the University of Alabama law school and former federal prosecutor. \u201cThere are often rocky dealings with a cooperator, and Mueller didn\u2019t cut bait at the first sign of trouble. It was likely more than one lie and this would not have been a minor detail \u2014 it had to be something material and significant and intentional.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "The Rise and Fall of Paul Manafort: Greed, Deception and Ego", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/us/politics/manafort-trump-trial.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Manafort soon had plenty of detractors among the campaign staff. He won few points by calling Mr. Trump \u201cDonald\u201d in his first CNN appearance, as if he were Mr. Trump\u2019s peer. Some aides suggested he was unfamiliar with all the changes in politics \u2014 most notably the rise of the internet \u2014 since 1996, when he last worked on an American presidential campaign. Others described him as lazy, carefully noting when he took off on Fridays for the Hamptons. Mr. Manafort said he had built a television studio at his home there so he could appear on Sunday talk shows remotely.\n\nHe lasted only five months, three of them as campaign chairman. When The New York Times revealed that a ledger found by Ukrainian investigators had listed $12.7 million in off-the-books cash payments to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm, one former campaign aide said that Mr. Trump was enraged. But another article detailing how Mr. Manafort and others were begging Mr. Trump to stop picking public fights equally angered Mr. Trump. When Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told Mr. Manafort he was out, Mr. Trump was barely speaking to him.\n\nBy then, Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial house of cards was on the verge of collapse. Less than two weeks after he left the campaign, one lender informed him that it had started to foreclose on his Brooklyn brownstone. He had paid cash for it when he was financially flush four years earlier, then borrowed $5.3 million against it that February. Five months had passed with no payments.\n\nMr. Gates managed to retain his affiliation to Mr. Trump as a liaison between the campaign and the Republican National Committee, although Mr. Trump disliked him so much that he was barred from flying on the candidate\u2019s private plane. Mr. Manafort tried to use his lingering connection to Mr. Trump to land consulting work and to persuade banks to bail him out. He dangled a possible cabinet secretary post in front of Stephen Calk, chairman of Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, pressing Mr. Gates to promote him as a possible secretary of the Army.\n\nHe continued to treat Mr. Gates as his aide, asking him how to convert profit-and-loss statements from PDF format into Word in order, prosecutors said, to inflate his income and appear more creditworthy to banks. After the election, Mr. Calk approved two loans to Mr. Manafort for a total of $16 million. Mr. Manafort used some of it to save his Brooklyn property from foreclosure.\n\nBut even Mr. Calk was getting worried. On Dec. 7, 2016, he wrote to another top bank official: \u201cNervousness is setting in.\u201d Less than a year later, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team filed the first of a series of indictments against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Mueller granted a plea deal to Mr. Gates and immunity from prosecution to five of the nearly dozen witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Manafort celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary in jail. He was allowed three visits limited to 30 minutes each. A notice on the website for his legal defense fund read: \u201cPaul and his family are reaching out to anyone who can assist him at this time.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Ringleader of Democratic Rebels Softens Tone on Pelosi", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/pelosi-democrats-house-rules.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "The demands of those Democrats, members of a bipartisan coalition calling itself the Problem Solvers Caucus, put another wrinkle in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s effort to win the speakership, a painstaking campaign she has undertaken in the wake of Democrats\u2019 midterm election victories that has involved trying to put down a mini-rebellion among her longtime foes and newcomers demanding change. The preliminary test will be when Democrats meet on Wednesday to cast secret ballots for their leaders.\n\nBut the ultimate verdict will not come until January, when the new Congress must elect a speaker on the House floor. The threat of a leadership fight has given rank-and-file Democrats a tantalizing opportunity to air their grievances and make demands in the hopes of winning concessions from Ms. Pelosi, who has said she is certain she will have enough votes to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\n\u201cFor us, our rules proposal isn\u2019t about changing leadership; it\u2019s about changing a system that stymies the will of the common-sense majority,\u201d the group said in a statement on Monday, adding that its proposals would \u201chelp spur immediate action on health care, immigration and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe group is essentially asking Ms. Pelosi and the incoming Democratic leadership to fundamentally alter the procedures of the House, where the majority rules absolutely and its leaders have ultimate say on what legislative proposals are considered. It instead supports allowing bipartisan measures to have a chance of being debated and voted upon.\n\nAmong the group\u2019s proposals is mandating that any bill receiving 290 co-sponsors would go to the House floor for debate and a timely vote, an idea that a senior Democratic aide said Ms. Pelosi had already agreed to include in proposed rules she will present when the new Congress convenes in January. Another would guarantee that any amendment that has at least 20 Democratic and 20 Republican co-sponsors would get a debate and a vote. The third request, aimed at empowering rank-and-file lawmakers, is that each member be allowed to introduce one bill, co-sponsored by a member of the other party, to be debated and considered on a committee on which he or she serves.\n\nThe effort has infuriated newly empowered liberals, who have accused the Problem Solvers Caucus of being \u201ccorporatist\u201d Democrats beholden to the same political donors that Republicans rely on. They question why Democrats are always the ones to cede power when they attain it.\n\nThe nine Democrats are in addition to the group that signed the letter last week vowing not to support Ms. Pelosi, a coalition initially numbering 17 that has shrunk since its leaders first sought to form it. There are also at least four newly elected Democrats who did not sign the letter, but have said they will keep their campaign pledge not to back Ms. Pelosi. Another new member who said during his campaign that he would not back Ms. Pelosi, Representative-elect Gil Cisneros of California, added his name to the letter on Monday."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Mia Love Criticizes Trump in Scathing Concession Speech", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/mia-love-trump-utah.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 09:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cMia Love gave me no love, and she lost,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cToo bad.
