Chuck Schumer did not immediately reject the offer the White House made last Saturday night, which included more than $1.3 billion but less than the $5 billion Trump initially wanted.

A Schumer spokesperson provided this readout of that meeting: \"The Vice President came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we're still very far apart.\"\n\nAsked on Sunday if the President will sign or veto a bill that Democrats pass, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that \"it depends what's in it,\" but added that Trump is \"ready to negotiate.\"\n\n\"He wants to make a deal on border security.

The employee is considered \"essential,\" so she is working without pay during the shutdown.\n\n\"Personally, I'm like, what federal employees are you talking to? Because it's not people at my institution,\" she told CNN. \"None of us want the government shut down. None of us want to be working and not getting paid.

This means that she and some others at her facility are also working mandatory overtime during this period.\n\nShe expressed frustration with some of the comments being made by lawmakers in Washington.\n\n\"As federal employees, when statements are made, the effects and attitudes that respond from it are negative and frustration, because you are not in our shoes. You're not experiencing what we're experiencing,\" she said. \"If the shoe were on the other foot, if you took a day at my job, would you really feel like what you're doing right now is right?\"\n\nAcross the country, the Esparza family in Kent, Washington, along with some 42,000 other active duty Coast Guard members, will not be paid during the shutdown.\n\nThe Coast Guard is the only military branch that isn't paid during the government shutdown; they technically are part of the Department of Homeland Security.

Her husband, Joshua, has been in the Coast Guard for 14 years.\n\nNow, the Esparzas are trying to get a hold on what bills must be paid, and what can wait.\n\n\"First thing was we can get almost all the bills paid, but what are we going to do about rent, because our rent comes from my husband's pay, which includes housing allowance,\" she says. \"Without that we can't afford the Seattle area.\"\n\nEsparza estimates that they'll incur about $200 in late fees; money her family doesn't have -- especially after the holidays.\n\nThe pain doesn't stop in their bank accounts. Jacqui Esparza is mourning the loss of their grandfather.\n\nThe airfare cost is just another financial hit to their bank account.\n\n\"The politicians can bicker all the want on Capital Hill,\" she says. \"But stop using the military and their pay as a bargaining chip.\"\n\nShutdown stretches into second week\n\nWhile some federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Smithsonian museums were able to use other funds to remain open for the first week of the shutdown, as the shutdown enters week two, those funds have dried up.\n\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an email to agency staff on Dec. 27 informing them that if a shutdown deal was not reached by midnight on Dec. 28, the agency would begin orderly shutdown procedures. The Smithsonian announced that all museums, research centers and facilities, including the National Zoo, would close starting Jan. 2 if a shutdown deal was not reached.\n\nAt the National Zoo in Washington, DC, all animals will continue to be fed and cared for during the shutdown, but live animal cams, including the popular Panda Cam, would no longer broadcast once the zoo closes.\n\nAccording to the zoo's website, the cameras require \"federal resources, primarily staff, to run\" and are \"deemed non-essential.\"\n\nNational Parks across the country remain \"as accessible as possible,\" during the shutdown, according to an agency spokesperson. For some parks, state and city governments have stepped in to cover funding and keep them open.\n\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state would provide funding to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open. In Philadelphia, a local nonprofit organization, VISIT PHILADELPHIA, donated money to keep Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell open for three days starting Dec. 28.\n\n\"People come to New York, they come to see the sights, and it's important at this dark time in our country to keep the torch on the Statue of Liberty lit, metaphorically,\" Cuomo said on radio station WAMC on Dec. 27."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "With an eye to power and profit, Beijing is building influence in the Arctic", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/spWj9Ju-swE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In its quest to become a global superpower, China has regularly become entangled in territorial disputes with its neighbors, butting up against international law.\n\nBut there's one region on its radar with fewer rivals and where the rules are still being decided: the polar Arctic.\n\nChina sees an opportunity in the Arctic's expansive sea of melting ice. Beijing has begun pushing for a greater stake in the region with a view to opening new trade routes, exploring for oil and gas and conducting research on climate change, experts say.\n\nGeographically, China is nowhere near the Arctic Circle, which puts the Asian powerhouse at a major political disadvantage compared to eight countries that make up the Arctic Council, all of whom have territory inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nCouncil members are divided on China's growing interest in the region. Some smaller economies like Iceland and Norway see an opportunity, others with a strategic interest like Russia and Canada are growing wary.\n\nChina isn't the only non-Arctic state interested in the region but it is by far the biggest, China and polar region expert Marc Lanteigne of Massey University in New Zealand told CNN.\n\nIn 2013 it joined India, South Korea, Japan and Singapore in gaining non-voting observer status on the Council.\n\n\"Overall, there's been the acceptance that China is going to be a player there, but there is still some concern about the ambiguity to what China's endgame is,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nArctic Council foreign ministers with then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on May 11, 2017.\n\nPolar silk road\n\nIn January, Beijing published its first Arctic strategy white paper, claiming a vested interest in the region while attempting to allay fears over its territorial ambitions.\n\nIt defines itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in the document, saying environmental changes in the Arctic have a \"direct impact on China's climate system and ecological environment.\"\n\nThe white paper details Beijing's plans for a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure program, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping whose government has spent big to build vast trade corridors across the world.\n\nWhile the Belt and Road initiative has drawn criticism in the West due to concerns that China is ensnaring developing countries in debt, Lanteigne says it's welcomed by some of the smaller Arctic players keen on building economic ties with Beijing.\n\n\"It has excited quite a few of the Nordic states who see the possibility of expanded Chinese sea traffic and potentially new ports,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nThe idea of a mutually beneficial partnership is exactly the reassuring message China sought to drive home in its Arctic policy, with repeated references to \"cooperation.\"\n\nMelting sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast on March 30, 2017 above Greenland.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to Arctic Council concerns before China's admission, when members feared it could seek to repeat its South China Sea territorial grab in the Arctic Circle.\n\nBeijing claims an enormous swath of territory in the South China Sea, and has created heavily fortified artificial islands to help assert its position in the Spratly and Paracel island chains.\n\nIn comparison, the situation in the Arctic is relatively peaceful, according to experts, with no serious territorial disputes. And the Arctic states are eager to keep it that way.\n\n'Brimming with economic potential'\n\nBeijing claims the main reason for its interest in the Arctic is scientific research.\n\nIn the white paper, it detailed a desire to investigate the effects of climate change to \"resolve global environmental issues.\"\n\nBut skeptics have argued that China's Arctic ambitions are largely fueled by the economic and political appeal of dominating a resource-rich area.\n\nIt is estimated that the Arctic may hold nearly one-third of the world's natural gas and 13% of global oil reserves, according to a report by Rachael Gosnell at the University of Maryland.\n\nAnd as rising temperatures melt the region's ice, shipping routes that were once impassible are now an attractive and feasible alternative for the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The Arctic is brimming with economic potential,\" said Gosnell, who estimates that the annual economy of the region exceeds $450 billion.\n\nAccording to NASA, some global climate models predict the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months by the middle of this century, likely making its waters an important shipping route.\n\n\"China really wants to put itself in a position whereby, should there be some kind of scramble or push for Arctic resources, China would be very well placed to take advantage of that,\" said Lanteigne, the polar region expert.\n\nTo secure that position, it is strengthening its Arctic capabilities. In September, China launched a second icebreaker known as Xue Long 2, or Snow Dragon 2, with an expedition scheduled for the first half of 2019, according to state-run media.\n\nThe newly minted vessel is the first Chinese-built icebreaker. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation claims it will be more capable of cutting through ice and carrying out advanced research than its foreign-built predecessor.\n\nChina's first domestically-built icebreaker, Xuelong 2, during a launch ceremony at a shipyard in Shanghai in September.\n\nWashington's loss, Beijing's gain\n\nChina has been quick to recognize the importance of investing in the Arctic at a time when there are few participants and even fewer laws, so that it can eventually restructure Arctic governance in its favor, said Harriet Moynihan, associate fellow at the UK think tank Chatham House.\n\nChina's increasing involvement in the Arctic Circle has also coincided with a growing lack of interest from Washington.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to eliminate a special envoy and representative for the Arctic region in 2017, as climate change dropped down the list of priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet. In 2018 only two functioning icebreakers remain, one of which is a heavy-duty vessel overdue for an update.\n\nThe Obama administration pursued an ambitious Arctic strategy to ensure the US remained a strong power in regional affairs, including plans to replace the heavy icebreaker by 2020.\n\nBut it's unclear where the US now stands on those plans. The US Coast Guard, which runs the icebreakers, faces significant budget cuts as more and more funding is reconsidered for border security.\n\n\"Because of the fact that the Arctic is not a priority for the Trump government, this has allowed China to take the steering wheel and accelerate their own Arctic policies,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nRussia is arguably the most active Arctic state, with a fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, and it is reluctant to allow non-Arctic countries to develop the region.\n\nBut facing mounting Western sanctions, Moscow's attitude toward China has warmed considerably. \"Russia realized that China was one of the few countries left that could really help with Siberian development,\" Lanteigne said.\n\n\"The two countries have cooperated in a number of Arctic ventures, including a liquefied natural gas project.\"\n\nWith large parts of the Arctic still difficult for China to reach, it remains less important to Beijing than investments in other parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia.\n\nBut China's presence in the far north is only likely to grow -- whether the Arctic states are pleased about it or not."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'50-50' chance Brexit won't happen, says senior minister", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/qGBad1OBC2A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) A senior UK government minister has warned there is a \"50-50\" chance Brexit won't happen, if Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is voted down in Parliament next month.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter, told the Sunday Times that the only way to be \"100% certain\" Britain will leave the European Union is if ministers back the deal.\n\nThe UK is scheduled to exit the bloc on March 29 next year.

His crime: he tried to take his own life.\n\nAfter weeks of being hungry and jobless, the 25-year old says he reached breaking point after a security guard pushed him to the ground while he was searching for work at a building site.\n\n\"I was tired of walking around that day. And I was determined to work there... so I tried to force my way in, then he pushed me, and I fell down flat on the floor,\" Ugokwe told CNN.\n\n\"I started begging him because I was tired, I really needed that job because I needed to eat.\"\n\nHumiliated, Ugokwe went to a nearby lagoon and jumped in.\n\nAfter being rescued by passing fishermen, Ugokwe says he was handed over to police officers who arrested him and put him in jail.\n\nAttempting suicide is a criminal offense in Nigeria, under Section 327 of the Criminal Code Act, and carries a penalty of up to one year in prison. A holdover from when Nigeria was a British colony, the law was abolished in Britain under the Suicide Act of 1961, which happened after Nigeria gained its independence in 1960.\n\nUgokwe says he's speaking out about his attempt to take his own life despite stigma around the subject in Nigeria because he doesn't want people to suffer as he did.\n\nWhen he woke up on the fisherman's boat, Ugokwe says he was angry that his attempt had failed.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Ugokwe was held at a cell near the Lagos lagoon, in the country's economic capital, before being transferred one week later to another cell on the Lagos mainland.\n\nUgokwe says he was unaware that attempted suicide was a crime in Nigeria.\n\n\"When they put me in the cell, the first thing that came to my mind was what did I do? I didn't kill anybody. I did not steal. What am I doing here? What did I do wrong? It's my life, not (the) government's life,\" he said.\n\nShortly after his arrest in February, Ugokwe appeared before a magistrate to determine whether he had committed an offense. His case was postponed and he was transferred to another facility on Lagos Island.\n\nIt was there he met Imanuella Ojeah, a criminal lawyer and a member of the Elevation Church in Lagos, whose volunteer prison unit makes weekly trips to local prisons.\n\n\"I remember he seemed tired of life. He begged me to get him out of that place. He told me... I am not mad. I am just depressed and don't have money to eat,\" Ojeah told CNN.\n\nOjeah and her team represented Ugokwe at his next court appearance at Sabo Magistrates Court, a few weeks later, in April 2017. They were asked if someone was willing to act as a guarantor for Ugokwe and look after his welfare if he were released.\n\nOjeah found someone from the Elevation Church who agreed to look after Ugokwe and the magistrate dismissed the case.\n\nAlthough Ugokwe found freedom, the legal process around these types of cases is lengthy and complicated for people suffering from serious mental health issues, says health law expert Cheluchi Onyemelukwe who is campaigning to abolish the suicide law in the country.\n\n\"What happens in the legal process is the police arrest you, put you in a cell, and then charge the matter to court and you are arraigned before a magistrate who determines whether it appears an offense has been committed,\" she says.\n\nAs in Ugokwe's case, the survivor is then remanded to jail to wait for a trial date. If found guilty, they may be imprisoned for a maximum of one year.\n\nAlthough jail terms for suicide survivors are rare, Onyemelukwe says it is the process of arresting and taking them through a legal process that is particularly cruel.\n\n\"I believe it doesn't reflect who we are as Nigerians... it is inhumane and I know that we can do better than that. I think it is probably the worst possible thing that you could do to somebody who finds themselves in that sort of situation,\" she said.\n\n\"People who are thrown into a cell right after... wonder why the suicide wasn't successful. It makes people that I have spoken to feel helpless and feel like there really isn't a reason to go on.\"\n\nUgokwe says he contemplated suicide again while in jail because of the conditions he was held in.\n\n\"The worst part of it was not just that they put me in prison, it was that they locked me in a cell with crazy people. I was with mentally disturbed people. Most of the people there were talking to themselves and jumping around.\"\n\nIn jail, Ugokwe says he and other inmates were forced to take pills.\n\n\"At first, when they brought the pills to me, I refused... there was nothing wrong with me, but then I was beaten and forced to take the pills.\n\n\"Those pills had terrible effects on me... all I want to do is sleep and eat.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Lagos division of the Nigerian Prisons Service, which operates prisons in the country, denied Ugokwe's allegations.\n\n\"Allegations and incidents of force-feeding, beating and or forceful admission of medication on inmates are false and do not occur in any prison within the Lagos Command,\" Rotimi Oladokun told CNN in an emailed statement.\n\n\"The Controller of Prisons, Lagos Command has no tolerance for such excesses and will not condone such under his command,\" he added.\n\nThe Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Adeniji Kazeem told CNN that although attempted suicide is criminalized in the country, the state does not recommend that anyone should be locked up.\n\nSuicide rates are usually underreported in Nigeria because of the stigma associated with it. However, the World Health Organization estimates that there are 9.5 suicides per every 100,000 people in the country.\n\nSome common causes are depression and anxiety linked to high levels of poverty.\n\nA 2017 WHO report found that Nigerians have the highest incidences of depression in Africa , with around 7,079,815 suffering from depression, a figure that represents 3.9% of the population.\n\nIn 2015, Lagos State amended its law to recommend hospital treatment for those who have attempted suicide.\n\nBut the law has yet to be changed at a national level and is not currently being considered for review, according to health law expert Onyemelukwe.\n\n\"We are guided by what the law says,\" Kazeem says. \"But in the hierarchy of offenses, this is a simple offense, and the recommended action is hospitalization.\n\n\"The law does not say anyone should be incarcerated. Attempted suicide is not a crime. It shows some form of disorder which needs medical attention.\"\n\nKazeem added: \"My office has not prosecuted anyone. The state government does not prosecute attempted suicide victims.

It is estimated that 18% of the population is unemployed. This is particularly high among young people who make up 60% of the country's population. Nigeria recently overtook India as the nation with the most extreme poverty in the world. Around half of the country's population are thought to be living on less than $1.90 a day. Despite being the largest oil producer in Africa, Nigeria has struggled to translate its resource wealth into decent living standards for people like Ifeanyi Ugokwe and many others who attempt suicide because of hunger and hopelessness.\n\nThere are frequent reports in local media of survivors being arrested and tried for attempting suicide.\n\nIn July this year, a 27-year-old man was charged in court with attempting suicide in June.\n\nOther African countries like Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Gambia, and South Sudan also outlaw suicide.\n\nOnyemelukwe says the suicide law, a legacy of the colonial era, has no place in Nigeria today.\n\n\"I want Nigerians to see real people who have attempted suicide and have survived and realize that these are people who could be our friends, our brothers, our sisters, our mothers, our fathers.\n\n\"Attempted suicide in itself is a risk factor for contemplating suicide. In fact, it is the predictor of the fact that somebody will commit suicide. We are in a place where all of these laws deserve a second, a third, a fourth look until we change it,\" she added.\n\nShe believes police need to be given the power to refer survivors for treatment rather than arrested and put through the legal system.\n\n\"The person doesn't have to spend any time in prison,\" she says.\n\nLife has started to get better for Ugokwe in recent months. He's found friends he can call on when he's feeling sad but he's still trying to get back on his feet.\n\nThinking back on his time in jail, Ugokwe says he wouldn't want anyone to go through what he experienced.\n\n\"No one deserves that,\" he said.\n\n\"At that time, I needed love. I didn't need to be put in prison and punished for something I don't even understand.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'Third gender' law hailed as a revolution", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/x41stpW7LoM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Berlin (CNN) By the time Lynn D. turned 2, he had already undergone seven surgeries. His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Opinion: The unintended consequences of killing Jamal Khashoggi", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/U4Gpl7VTFH4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Sam Kiley is a CNN senior international correspondent. The opinions in this article belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Details of what happened October 2 were being drip-fed by Turkish officials with the narrative skill of TV scriptwriters hooking a global audience into an addictive box set.\n\nThe popular journalist and affable raconteur Jamal Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nHe'd been suffocated. His body had disappeared. He was allegedly chopped into pieces with a bone saw brought on a private plane.\n\nThere were various suggestions that his remains had been dissolved into acid, stuffed down a well or wrapped in a blanket and taken away by a local \"collaborator.\"\n\nAs the saga unfolded, the US Senate voted to accuse Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of being behind the killing.\n\nBut there's a subplot that might give this body bag of a story a silver lining.\n\nSaudi Arabia admitted, eventually, that The Washington Post columnist had indeed been killed, but that this was not sanctioned by the royal court. Rather, it was a unilateral decision taken on the ground by the head of a team that was supposed, at worst, to abduct Khashoggi and drag him back to the kingdom.\n\nWhatever the Saudis claim, the abiding result of the Khashoggi tragedy has been to paint Saudi Arabia as a vicious, uncivilized land run by a despotic family. Not as the forward-thinking nation and leading light of the modern Islamic world that its crown prince would like to project.\n\nOne Saudi critic of the royal court replied to a text I sent him from Riyadh in the first fortnight of covering the story in which I asked, \"Whodunnit?\"\n\n\"Don Corleone.\"\n\nBy referring to the fictitious mafia leader in \"The Godfather,\" the man was perhaps risking his life. Most other contacts in Riyadh to whom I spoke were circumspect to say the least -- sticking firmly to whatever the prevailing narrative was being spun out of the royal court.\n\nSo I deleted his text, removed his number from my contacts' list both in my phone and on the cloud -- and destroyed any notes that could have led an investigator to him.\n\nNot since the 1980 docudrama \"Death of a Princess,\" which alleged that Princess Mishaal bint Fahd al Saud was executed on the orders of her grandfather, and her alleged lover beheaded, has Saudi Arabia suffered such reputational damage.\n\nJUST WATCHED Time magazine names 2018 Person of the Year Replay More Videos ...

Indeed, it's a stalwart of the West's fight against violent political Islam, part of the US-led coalition standing against Iran's regional meddling, and the world's second-biggest producer of crude oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a vital economic partner, a major consumer of American weapons and an intimate friend when it comes to regional intelligence sharing.\n\nIt's also involved in a war in Yemen, which has killed an estimated 85,000 children , according to Save the Children. Another 14 million are at risk of starvation -- among them 400,000 children who are, the United Nations says, on the brink of hunger.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which supports the internationally recognized government of Yemen in its fight against the Iranian-backed Houthis, shows no signs of being able to win the war or stave off the humanitarian disaster.\n\nSo it's agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nSaudi Arabia cannot afford to be seen, or accused, of causing a famine on its doorstep.\n\nReeling from the fallout of the Khashoggi case, which it can do little about given the presumption of guilt that's attached itself to the kingdom's most powerful figure, Saudi Arabia needs to do and be seen to be doing \"the right thing.\"\n\nThat means backing away from war into peace in Yemen.\n\nIt's an unintended but welcome potential ending to the Khashoggi saga's subplot."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Hotel employees who asked black guest to leave fired", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/6YJYXz8Vm9M/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two employees seen on video asking a black guest to leave a Portland, Oregon, hotel after he took a phone call in the lobby have been let go, the facility said Saturday on Twitter.\n\nThe incident took place December 22 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Portland.\n\nJermaine Massey was in the hotel lobby when a security guard informed him that police were on their way to escort him off the property.\n\nMassey accused the guard of \"harassing\" him, and in a statement provided to CNN by his attorneys, characterized the incident as \"calling his mother while black.\"\n\n\"We have terminated the employment of the two men involved in the mistreatment of Mr. Massey,\" the hotel said on Twitter.\n\n\"Their actions were inconsistent with our standards & values.

He said, \"But many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall.\" On Thursday, he tweeted, \"Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?\"\n\nTrump offered no evidence that most of the 800,000 people working without pay or not working belong to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The federal government is an apolitical workforce comprised of hardworking veterans, law enforcement officers, scientists, analysts, janitors, nurses and many other civil servants all with diverse backgrounds and demographics,\" J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told CNN in a statement. \"A government shutdown doesn't hurt any one political party or any one federal employee more than another, it hurts all of them.\"\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees is a labor union that represents over 700,000 federal employees at several agencies.\n\nA representative of AFGE local chapter 1637, who is an employee at the Bureau of Prisons in Texas, said that she does not support the shutdown. The employee is considered \"essential,\" so she is working without pay during the shutdown.\n\n\"Personally, I'm like, what federal employees are you talking to? Because it's not people at my institution,\" she told CNN. \"None of us want the government shut down. None of us want to be working and not getting paid. Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, Green parties, all of us that work, at least at my facility, we want to get paid.\"\n\nThis federal employee works the overnight shift at her job. She is engaged and planning a July wedding. This week, she missed putting deposits down at her wedding reception venue and church. She also canceled an appointment to start getting her wedding dress made next week. She's worried that if she puts those payments down now, and the shutdown continues, she won't be able to pay her rent and other more pressing bills in the coming months.\n\n\"That's thousands of dollars that I can't just put out somewhere not knowing when I'm going to get paid again,\" she said. \"My well-being is not at stake, but my dreams and hopes for something in life are being fractured and highly possibly shattered.\"\n\nShe said that because some people are frustrated they are not getting paid and still have to work, they are not showing up to work. This means that she and some others at her facility are also working mandatory overtime during this period.\n\nShe expressed frustration with some of the comments being made by lawmakers in Washington.\n\n\"As federal employees, when statements are made, the effects and attitudes that respond from it are negative and frustration, because you are not in our shoes. You're not experiencing what we're experiencing,\" she said. \"If the shoe were on the other foot, if you took a day at my job, would you really feel like what you're doing right now is right?\"\n\nAcross the country, the Esparza family in Kent, Washington, along with some 42,000 other active duty Coast Guard members, will not be paid during the shutdown.\n\nThe Coast Guard is the only military branch that isn't paid during the government shutdown; they technically are part of the Department of Homeland Security. However, the Coast Guard announced Friday night that the administration has identified a way to ensure \"military members that served on active duty in the month of December and those reserve military members that drilled prior to the lapse in appropriation\" will get paid on December 31.\n\n\"This isn't our first rodeo,\" Jacqui Esparza says, but she's expecting it to be the worst one ever. Her husband, Joshua, has been in the Coast Guard for 14 years.\n\nNow, the Esparzas are trying to get a hold on what bills must be paid, and what can wait.\n\n\"First thing was we can get almost all the bills paid, but what are we going to do about rent, because our rent comes from my husband's pay, which includes housing allowance,\" she says. \"Without that we can't afford the Seattle area.\"\n\nEsparza estimates that they'll incur about $200 in late fees; money her family doesn't have -- especially after the holidays.\n\nThe pain doesn't stop in their bank accounts. Jacqui Esparza is mourning the loss of their grandfather.\n\nThe airfare cost is just another financial hit to their bank account.\n\n\"The politicians can bicker all the want on Capital Hill,\" she says. \"But stop using the military and their pay as a bargaining chip.\"\n\nShutdown stretches into second week\n\nWhile some federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Smithsonian museums were able to use other funds to remain open for the first week of the shutdown, as the shutdown enters week two, those funds have dried up.\n\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an email to agency staff on Dec. 27 informing them that if a shutdown deal was not reached by midnight on Dec. 28, the agency would begin orderly shutdown procedures. The Smithsonian announced that all museums, research centers and facilities, including the National Zoo, would close starting Jan. 2 if a shutdown deal was not reached.\n\nAt the National Zoo in Washington, DC, all animals will continue to be fed and cared for during the shutdown, but live animal cams, including the popular Panda Cam, would no longer broadcast once the zoo closes.\n\nAccording to the zoo's website, the cameras require \"federal resources, primarily staff, to run\" and are \"deemed non-essential.\"\n\nNational Parks across the country remain \"as accessible as possible,\" during the shutdown, according to an agency spokesperson. For some parks, state and city governments have stepped in to cover funding and keep them open.\n\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state would provide funding to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open. In Philadelphia, a local nonprofit organization, VISIT PHILADELPHIA, donated money to keep Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell open for three days starting Dec. 28.\n\n\"People come to New York, they come to see the sights, and it's important at this dark time in our country to keep the torch on the Statue of Liberty lit, metaphorically,\" Cuomo said on radio station WAMC on Dec. 27."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump issues executive order freezing federal workers' pay in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/6A5_2So5CAU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump issued an executive order Friday freezing federal workers' pay for 2019, following through on a proposal he announced earlier in the year.\n\nThe move, which nixes a 2.1% across-the-board pay raise that was set to take effect in January, comes as hundreds of thousands of federal employees are expecting to begin the new year furloughed or working without pay because of a partial government shutdown.\n\nTrump told lawmakers he planned to scrap the 2019 pay bump for federal workers in August, saying the federal budget couldn't support it. In addition to the 2.1% pay increase, the executive order also cancels a yearly adjustment of paychecks based on the region of the country where workers are posted, called the \"locality pay increase,\" that was due to take effect in January.\n\nThe move does not affect a 2.6% pay increase for US troops next year that was passed as part of the massive defense spending bill Trump signed in August.\n\nLawmakers could include a pay raise for 2019 in a spending bill to reopen the government, but negotiations have been at an impasse over money for Trump's border wall.\n\nAbout 380,000 federal employees are on furlough and 420,000 are working without pay as the new year approaches.\n\nIn a letter to House and Senate leaders in August, Trump described the pay increase as \"inappropriate.\"\n\n\"We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,\" the President wrote.\n\nTrump also stressed that a pay freeze would not affect the federal government's ability to attract qualified workers.

Progressives are pushing for a \"Green New Deal\" -- a comprehensive package that would reimagine the US economy and the government's place in it -- that has been met with skepticism, and a few notes of hostility, by party centrists. Other fights are brewing over raising the national minimum wage, trade and Middle East policy.\n\nThese internal disputes will play out on two stages over the coming year -- the floor of the newly Democratic-controlled House, and in the 2020 primary debates, which begin in June\n\nParty angst over how to beat Trump in 2020 will fuel these fights, with establishment forces worried about alienating the suburban moderates who powered the party's 2018 wave while the insurgent progressives make the case that only bold new initiatives can renew -- and turn out -- its working class base.\n\nHere is a look ahead at some of the debates that will animate the coming year.\n\nGetting real about 'Medicare for all'\n\n\"Medicare for all,\" a form of single-payer health care, is the party's most popular big-ticket proposal for delivering on its promise of universal health care -- a solution to the ongoing challenges facing the Affordable Care Act that even former President Barack Obama seemed to endorse in a speech this past fall\n\nLawmakers and liberal think tanks began to sketch out the narrower terms of the debate in 2018, rolling out a variety of plans that would either chart a path to universal government-backed care or expand coverage by allowing Americans to \"buy in\" to programs like Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nThe push for a \"buy in\" offer, which would effectively create some form of the \"public option\" scuppered by Congressional Democrats during the Obamacare negotiations in 2009, was given a boost during the party's leadership scramble after New York Rep. Brian Higgins, secured an assurance last month from Nancy Pelosi to prioritize a plan to allow people 50 and older to buy into Medicare.\n\nBut with Democrats still in the Senate minority and shut out of the White House, proponents of more comprehensive reform are unlikely to accept compromise terms.\n\nLast year, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a likely 2020 candidate who caucuses with the Democrats, secured 16 cosponsors to his latest and most detailed legislation, which introduced a four-year plan for gradually moving millions of Americans onto the rolls of a beefed-up version of Medicare.\n\nAt least five of the names on the bill, in addition to Sanders', are considering runs in 2020 -- New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who helped write the transition plan, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley.\n\n\"There's going to be a question if any of those (other potential presidential candidates) take power: Do they actually want to create a single-payer program or is it just a messaging strategy to win people over with big ideas?,\" Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the progressive group Justice Democrats, told CNN. \"Do they support the end of private health insurance in the United States of America. Because that is what the bill is proposing to do. We're going to get way more into the specifics than we did in 2016.\"\n\nRaising worker wages\n\nSince Democrats last held the House in 2010, a movement for higher minimum wages has swept through the states, making $15 an hour the new benchmark for a livable income. A bill to move the national minimum wage to that level by 2024 is on the Democratic to-do list \u2014 but already, some on the left think that's too timid.\n\nThe proposals attracting the most attention, if not votes, are those that super-size the federal safety net and provide a public option for employment meant to raise wages by creating more competition for workers.\n\nHarris' LIFT Act would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to so many people that it resembles a \"universal basic income,\" an idea that has gained momentum over the past year. Alternatively, Sanders and Gillibrand have proposed a federal \"job guarantee,\" which would provide employment on public works projects to whomever wants to work.\n\nBut the bulk of the caucus probably won't go that far. Members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition are coalescing behind a proposal from Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell that would create regional minimum wages pegged to the variable costs of living, from midtown Manhattan to Beckley, West Virginia. According to a framework devised by the centrist think tank Third Way, wage floors would range from $9.30 in the cheapest places to $11.90 in the most expensive.\n\nThe debate is playing out against a difference of opinion around the root causes of stagnant wage growth.\n\nCentrists see the problem as a failure to help workers adapt to the trends of automation and globalization, which demands fixes such as more job training, apprenticeships, and vocational programs to equip them for high-demand careers like nursing, advanced manufacturing, and data science.\n\nOn the progressive left, however, a consensus is emerging that the real challenge is the rise of corporate consolidation and the decline of worker bargaining power. That in turn has allowed businesses to funnel excess profits to shareholders rather than higher wages, which would incentivize workers to pursue the type of education that made the most sense for them financially.\n\nIn order to take aim at that issue, Democrats like Booker and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin have introduced bills that would restrict companies' ability to buy back their own stock as well as direct federal regulators to scrutinize corporate mergers more carefully.\n\n\"We think what's really important is that policymakers are articulating a diagnosis of the economy that really centers the role of outsized corporate power, and the role of government to curb that power,\" says Stephanie Sterling, vice president for advocacy and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. \"We're not going to upskill our way to an economy where working people are getting a fair share.\"\n\nHooking infrastructure money to the end of fossil fuels\n\nPretty much everybody in Washington agrees that America's deteriorating roads, bridges, train tracks, transit networks and utilities need a surge of investment. But some Democrats argue those fixes should be wrapped into a plan to phase out fossil fuels entirely and massively scale up capacity for renewable energy generation in an effort to address global warming and lingering joblessness in one fell swoop.\n\nAn energized grassroots coalition led by freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez waged a campaign against House leadership to set up a select committee focused on crafting a \"Green New Deal,\" which would decarbonize the economy and provide universal employment.\n\nThe campaign for a committee failed, and there are still parts of the Democratic Party \u2014 such as transportation and building trade unions, whose members currently depend on continuing investment in highway construction and natural gas pipelines \u2014 who remain skeptical. But activists have vowed to keep fighting for the proposal as infrastructure plans surface in the next session, and they already have the support of 43 current or incoming members of Congress.\n\n\"The more momentum there is for a Green New Deal, the more that pulls the entire infrastructure debate in a bold direction,\" says Adam Green, co-director of a left-wing advocacy group called the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"It's not crazy to think that we could leave this year with 100 or even 150, 200 members who believe the Green New Deal is a North Star for when we have more power in 2021.\"\n\nA delicate line on trade\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic establishment was blindsided by how much anger Trump channeled by invoking the harsh legacy of trade deals in the industrial Midwest. Now they have to figure out how to heed that anger, while also avoiding Trump's chest-thumping rhetoric on tariffs, which turns off voters in both agricultural and urban districts.\n\n\"I think there's a danger with agreeing too much with Donald Trump on trade,\" said Third Way policy vice president Jim Kessler. \"We've seen the price that we're paying for tariffs. There's a difference between getting tough on China and igniting a trade war.\"\n\nThe new Congress will be forced to confront trade issues by way of a vote on the update to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Few Democrats are completely happy with the re-branded U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement, but enough of them view it as a step in the right direction \u2014 curtailing corporations' right to sue nations over restrictions on investments, for example \u2014 that it has a chance of passing, with some tweaks.\n\nThe problem is, the changes demanded by trade-skeptical Democrats may lose votes among more conservative Democrats, not to mention Republicans. A band of progressives led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut have demanded stronger enforcement mechanisms for the new labor and environmental standards, as well as a rollback of the intellectual property protections that grant pharmaceutical companies years-long monopolies on drugs.\n\nWhat happens in this fight will matter in 2020, as Democrats try to avoid letting Trump claim victory on trade while also dropping the established position that globalization creates more winners than losers.\n\nA new direction for the Middle East?\n\nDemocratic leaders have rushed to embrace their historically diverse slate of nominees. But as those newly elected voices enter Congress, a vexing question hangs on the horizon: When it comes to Israel, the Palestinians and the Middle East, does the party establishment really want to hear what they have to say?\n\nTrump's own renewed focus on the Middle East -- including his withdrawal from Syria, his reaction to the killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing war in Yemen -- have returned focus to the region generally at a time when peace negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians have collapsed.\n\nIncoming lawmakers like Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar are all challenging mainstream Democratic orthodoxy over the US' relationship with Israel.\n\nThe first two Muslim women elected to Congress, Tlaib and Omar have expressed support for the movement to boycott Israel over its activities in the West Bank and Gaza. BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, is a controversial program that has been met with harsh opposition by Israel and its supporters \u2014 particularly elected officials in the American government. A Senate bill called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would ban US companies from taking part in international boycotts like BDS, pits sponsors from both parties against progressive rivals and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes it on free speech grounds.\n\nThe bill remains in limbo for now, stalled after Sanders and Caifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated their opposition in a letter addressed to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"While we do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, we remain resolved to our constitutional oath to defend the right of every American to express their views peacefully without fear of or actual punishment by the government,\" Feinstein and Sanders wrote.\n\n\"Straight up, the party is not ready for the debate that is coming,\" one senior Democratic Senate aide told CNN. \"It is an overdue debate and my strong sense is that no, the party is not ready to have it \u2014 look who the foreign policy leaders are. But that doesn't matter because it's coming.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Analysis: The key 2018 lessons ahead of the 2020 election", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/bV2QEJkQBZ8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The final hours of 2018 are ticking down. The 2020 presidential season is about to kick into full swing. It's a time to look ahead, but it's also a time to reflect on the election cycle passed and to gleam from it lessons that can be learned.\n\nPut a less harmonious way, it's a chance to examine what I screwed up on this past year in order to do better in 2020.\n\nBeto O'Rourke and the predictive power of the presidential vote\n\nO'Rourke lost the Texas Senate race by less than 3 points to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. That was far closer than I thought it was going to end up being.\n\nA good portion of O'Rourke's success had to do with the fact that Texas is changing electorally. I don't think I grasped how telling the 2016 presidential result would be. Two years ago, Hillary Clinton lost Texas by less than 9 points , better than any Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s. In addition to O'Rourke's close race, Texas Democrats lost the House of Representative vote statewide by less than 6 points , even with a lot of incumbent Republicans running.\n\nThe idea that the presidential vote is predictive of downballot races isn't new. It is more powerful than it's ever been though. For example, four opposition party senators lost this year in states that Trump carried in 2016. That's one more than the total number of opposition party senators who lost midterm races in states the president won in the prior presidential election from 1982 to 2014.\n\nIf Democrats are going to take back the Senate in 2020, they'll probably need to do it in places where Clinton was competitive in 2016.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the unpredictability of primaries\n\nBy now, Ocasio-Cortez is a household name. That was not the case six months ago. I knew who Ocasio-Cortez was; however, I didn't think she had too much of a chance against New York Rep. Joe Crowley.\n\nIt's easy to overlearn the lessons of one primary, but Ocasio-Cortez's victory points to a lesson that I learned the hard way in 2016: primaries are weird things.\n\nWithout being able to go off party affiliation and often with low turnout, voters can surprise us. They may vote on different issues in one primary versus the last one. Being a woman candidate meant a lot more in 2018 on the Democratic side than ever before, for example.\n\nAdditionally, there is limited public polling (or no polling in the case of the Ocasio-Cortez stunner), and the polling that is available is often not that accurate. Turnout is far less predictable in primaries. Voters are also much more likely to change their minds at the last minute, as they learn more about the candidates.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential primaries, we could very well see candidates come from the polling nether regions at the last minute to win caucuses or primaries. In later contests, where no polling is taken, we could find out that maybe a candidate has unexpected strength in a state.\n\nRon DeSantis and the importance of the size of the polling lead\n\nThe next Florida governor looked like it was going to be Democrat Andrew Gillum. He led in about 90% of the nearly 60 polls taken after the primary and by an average of 3 to 4 points.\n\nYou can see the disconnect here: DeSantis leading in 10% of the nearly 60 polls (1 in 10) compared to a polling average suggesting he would win about 20% (1 in 5) to 25% (1 in 5) of the time based on the historical accuracy of polls.\n\nDeSantis ended up winning by less than a point. I fear that I fell into the trap of seeing lots of polls showing a Gillum small lead and thinking that lead was fairly secure. This didn't impact the words I wrote on the race. I do think it infected my tone, however.\n\nMy biggest worry is that I should have learned this lesson in 2016. Trump trailed in a lot of polls by a relative small margin in some pivotal swing states that he ended up winning.\n\nNext electoral cycle, it will be key to realize that just because a candidate holds a small lead in lots of polls it doesn't mean she or he will win. The size of the polling lead matters.\n\nWhat I got right: Electoral politics are still normal\n\nThe good news was that I didn't screw up anything massively in 2018. This wasn't another case of 2016 and the Republican presidential primary, which I got very, very wrong.\n\nThe success of these predictions wasn't because I had a keen insight. It was because I made a bet that even in the era of Trump, electoral politics would follow a normal path.\n\nSimply put, I made a bet that Trump's unpopularity would cost his party many seats in the House because that's the effect unpopular presidents had in the past during midterms. Meanwhile in the Senate, it was clear that there just weren't that many good pickup opportunities for Democrats compared to seats they had to defend.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, the key lesson of 2018 is to recognize that Trump doesn't defy electoral political gravity . The normal electoral rules of the presidency apply to him.\n\nIf Trump's popular, he'll likely win in 2020. If he's unpopular, he'll likely lose in 2020. Of course like any good forecast, there's an appropriate margin of error around that."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Departing senators warn: There's a problem with the current state of politics", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/CVVOLAs_G7Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As departing senators said their goodbyes to Washington, a number of Democrats and Republicans took the opportunity to express concern about the state of the Senate and the political climate.\n\n\"All the evidence points to an unsettling truth: The Senate as an institution is in crisis,\" retiring Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah lamented in his farewell speech delivered on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill , who was defeated in the November midterm elections, echoed that idea when she delivered her own farewell speech . \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was worried about this place,\" she said. \"It just doesn't work as well as it used to.\"\n\n\"Something is broken,\" the Missouri Democrat went on to say. \"If we don't have the strength to look in the mirror and fix it, the American people are going to grow more and more cynical.\"\n\nAs senators who were either ousted in the elections or decided to retire and not seek another term reflected on their time in Congress, many expressed dismay at how divided Washington has become as lawmakers retreat to entrenched partisan positions that leave little room for compromise or common ground.\n\nMost of them spoke in the final weeks of the year, a time largely overshadowed by a flurry of last-minute legislative activity and an unsuccessful effort to stave off a partial government shutdown. But the shuttering of roughly 25% of the federal government appeared to help illustrate a common sentiment conveyed during many of these farewell speeches: that something would need to change for Washington to function properly.\n\n'This is not a normal time'\n\nMcCaskill and Hatch weren't the only ones sounding alarm bells.\n\n\"To say that our politics is not healthy is somewhat of an understatement,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake said in his farewell speech . \"I believe that we all know well that this is not a normal time and that the threats to our democracy from within and without are real.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump , went beyond a critique of American politics to say he believes an \"authoritarian impulse\" is experiencing a resurgence worldwide and that the \"global commitment to democracy seems now to be on somewhat shaky ground.\"\n\nBut while departing senators had unique messages to impart, the overarching idea that there's a problem with the current state of politics was a consistent theme.\n\n\"What in the world has happened to civility and to humility in our nation's public discourse?\" Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who lost his seat in the midterms, asked in his farewell speech.\n\n\"Tribalism is our problem, and if not corrected, it's going to take our country down,\" he warned.\n\nYear marked by 'loss of comity'\n\nThe farewell speeches came as the most recent session of Congress drew to a close in late December -- a session that has been punctuated by a series of bitterly contentious fights on Capitol Hill.\n\nTensions ran high between Democratic and Republican senators during the confirmation hearings. In one dramatic moment, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina accused his Democratic colleagues of trying to \"destroy\" Kavanaugh's life for political gain.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters 00:42\n\nIn the end, only one Republican -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- opposed the nomination, while just one Democrat -- Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- sided with Senate Republicans to elevate Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nHatch said during his farewell speech that \"many factors contribute to the current dysfunction,\" but added, \"If I were to identify the root of the crisis it would be this: the loss of comity and genuine good feeling among Senate colleagues.\"\n\nIn yet another sign of division between the two parties, 2018 started off with a government shutdown at the end of January and ended with another fight in December, when a standoff between Trump and Democrats over funding for a border wall triggered a partial shutdown that began just days before Christmas\n\nDon't be afraid of 'tough votes' and other advice\n\nAs departing senators outlined concerns in their farewell speeches, many described what they believe has contributed to the highly divisive political climate and what they think needs to change.\n\nMcCaskill urged lawmakers to have the courage to take \"tough votes.\"\n\n\"Solving the toughest problems will not happen without tough votes,\" she said. \"We can talk about the toughest problems ... we can argue about them, we can campaign on them, but we're not going to solve them without tough votes.\"\n\nNelson and outgoing Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who also lost his seat in the midterms, suggested that an influx of big money in politics has had a corrosive effect, making an argument common to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The court's 2010 decision opened the floodgates and allowed the wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections and corrupt our democracy,\" Nelson said, referring to the landmark 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn his farewell speech, Donnelly said that \"the divisive rhetoric, the political campaigns, increasingly funded by tens of millions of dollars, anonymous, dark money interests is really doing damage to this country.\"\n\nNelson argued that another issue is the \"constant attempts to disenfranchise voters and make it more difficult for every American to have their voice heard at the ballot box.\"\n\nHatch, meanwhile, decried \"identity politics,\" a concept often invoked critically by Republicans, who frequently accuse Democrats of subscribing to it.\n\n\"We must reject the politics of division, starting with identity politics,\" the Utah Republican said, adding that \"identity politics is nothing more than dressed-up tribalism. It is the deliberate and often unnatural segregation of people into categories for political gain.\"\n\n'I love this place'\n\nIn their farewell speeches, departing senators also reflected on fond memories of their time in Congress, and some expressed optimism for the future despite their concerns.\n\n\"For all the problems I've outlined, know that I love this place,\" McCaskill said. \"We have fought, we have cried and we have laughed together.

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open .

I don't understand the logic of that,\" he said.\n\nBut Seaborne Freight, which was formed less than two years ago to revive the Ramsgate-Ostend line, insisted it will launch its freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend before 29 March.\n\n'Ready to commence'\n\nChief executive Ben Sharp said the firm had been founded by seasoned shipping veterans.\n\nHe declined to give details on which ships it planned to use for the service, saying the information was commercially sensitive, but said they planned to start operations with two ships before \"very quickly\" increasing to four by late summer.\n\nHe said dredging in Ramsgate Port would start on 4 January in preparation for the freight service.\n\nThe firm said it had originally intended to start the service in mid-February but this had now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.\n\nIt said directors and shareholders had been working during the past two years to restart the service.\n\n\"This phase has included locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure, as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating,\" the firm's statement added.\n\nEasing congestion\n\nThe government has also awarded additional, much larger ferry contracts to French company Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS, worth \u00a346.6m and \u00a347.3m respectively.\n\nThe new contracts are part of the government's contingency planning, which aims to ease the potential for severe congestion at main port Dover if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.\n\nThe department has warned that increased border checks by EU countries in the case of a no-deal Brexit could \"cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed\", and \"significant wider disruption to the UK economy and to the road network in Kent\".\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Joe Miller, BBC Business correspondent\n\nThe government has for some time now acknowledged that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, contingency plans at ports other than Dover would need to be in place.\n\nBut it appears that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's department only started awarding contracts to shipping firms a few weeks ago, with no time left, it says, for a full public tender process.\n\nAnd while the two large international firms enlisted to provide extra capacity have existing fleets and large operations, Seaborne does not, and has given precious little detail on how it will get a service up and running in a matter of months.\n\nThe Department for Transport also wasn't too keen on making much noise about these plans - it quietly posted notices of the awards on an EU portal on Christmas Eve, and the BBC was only alerted to them by a data firm, Tussell.\n\nAnd it's worth noting that without the award to Seaborne, the government would be a position where the two beneficiaries of a no-deal Brexit were a Danish and a French firm -

specialist boats which the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait.\n\nThe Home Office did not say whether the other four cutters would now be called back from search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean to patrol waters off England's south coast.\n\nSince November, more than 220 people have attempted to cross the Channel in small boats.\n\nThey include six men, all Iranian nationals, who were found on a beach at Kingsdown, near Deal, in Kent, on Sunday morning. They have been transferred to immigration officials.\n\nCompared to the number of refugees seeking asylum in the UK every year, the number who have attempted to cross the channel by dinghy is tiny, says BBC political correspondent Ben Wright.\n\nIn 2017, 26,350 people applied for asylum, an average of about 2,200 a month.\n\nImage copyright Lewis Morris Image caption Six men were found on Kingsdown beach on Sunday\n\nImage copyright Lewis Morris Image caption The group was found alongside a rigid-hulled inflatable boat\n\nMr Javid is expected to arrive back in the UK on Sunday, in time to chair a meeting on Monday with senior government officials, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency.\n\nOn Twitter, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner confirmed he had spoken by phone to Mr Javid, and that they were working together \"to combat Channel crossings\".\n\nIn a tweet, Mr Javid thanked him for the \"partnership\", saying the UK and France would \"build on our joint efforts to deter illegal immigration - protecting our borders and human life\".\n\nThe two are expected to meet face-to-face in January to assess whether further action is required.\n\nPre-Brexit 'rush'\n\nMany of the migrants are thought to be Iranian or Syrian. A BBC South East investigation last month found that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before \"the borders shut properly\" after Brexit.\n\nOne man from Afghanistan told the BBC

drowning off the coast of the UK.\"\n\nMs Chapman thought more people were using boats as security had been tightened around Calais, making it more difficult for people to use lorries on ferries or trains.\n\nThe mild weather may also have encouraged more to try the sea route, she said.\n\nChris Hogben, from the National Crime Agency, said it was new to see this level of Iranian migration and these groups would be paying serious organised criminals \"quite a bit of money\" to get across.\n\nHe said his officers were also seeing more migrants organise the crossing themselves, either by buying or stealing a boat, and he expected to see more attempts using that method in the coming weeks.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nSome MPs have called for more vessels to be deployed in the Channel, but Mr Javid said it was \"vital we strike a balance between protecting [migrants] and protecting our borders\".\n\nThe home secretary said he wanted to avoid encouraging more people to take the risk of attempting the crossing and was keeping the number of cutters \"under close review\".\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet: \"We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety.\"\n\nShadow home secretary Diane

shores\".\n\n'Joint security zone'\n\nCharlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, said he wanted to work with France to find the safe houses where people were being trafficked to, as well as identify

it quietly posted notices of the awards on an EU portal on Christmas Eve, and the BBC was only alerted to them by a data firm, Tussell.\n\nAnd it's worth noting that without the award to Seaborne, the government would be a position where the two beneficiaries of a no-deal Brexit were a Danish and a French firm -

When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?\"\n\nThere are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.\n\n\"Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,\" she adds.\n\nAdopt a dog\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are particular health benefits in adopting a dog, says Dr Rhys Thatcher\n\nA gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.\n\nBut though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University.\n\nInstead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping.\n\nBut there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says.\n\nIf you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption.\n\n\"This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,\" says Dr Thatcher.\n\nGet your 30 a week\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say diversity of plant-based foods is also important\n\nWe have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nBut according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity.\n\nWe should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.\n\nThat is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health.\n\nThe bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.\n\nAllergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOne way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi.\n\n\"Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix. Instead of buying one type of seed buy the four-seed mix,\" she says.\n\nSmile more often\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do not spend so much time focusing on arbitrary matters, do something that makes you smile instead\n\nAfter the excesses of the holiday season, many of us will be planning to lose a couple of stone or setting a target for how many times we go to the gym each week.\n\nBut the problem with \"arbitrary\" goals like these is that they are often difficult to achieve and failing to reach them can be demoralising, says Dr James Gill.\n\nInstead, he recommends focusing first on trying to be happier.\n\n\"There are lists of specific things that you can do to actively make your life healthier, but if you are not enjoying your life you probably won't stick to any difficult or challenging changes for the coming year,\" says Dr Gill, a locum GP and researcher at Warwick Medical School.\n\nBut how do you go about becoming happier?\n\nDr Gill recommends making one change in your life that will make you smile more often. At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it.\n\n\"Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year.\"\n\nAnd finally, get enough sleep\n\nIt may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults).\n\nEven being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter.\n\nThere are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.\n\nBut Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa's New Horizons: Excitement ahead of Ultima Thule flyby", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46699737", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alan Stern: \"It's pure science and pure exploration\"\n\nHistory will be made on Tuesday when Nasa's New Horizons probe sweeps past the icy world known as Ultima Thule.\n\nOccurring some 6.5 billion km (4 billion miles) from Earth, the flyby will set a new record for the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System object by a spacecraft.\n\nNew Horizons will gather a swathe of images and other data over the course of just a few hours leading up to and beyond the closest approach.\n\nThis is timed for 05:33 GMT.\n\nAt that moment, the probe will be about 3,500km from Ultima's surface and moving at 14km/s.\n\nWhen its observations are complete, the robotic craft will then turn to Earth to report in and begin downlinking the gigabytes of information stored in its memory.\n\nMission scientists, gathered in a control centre at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, are excited at what lies in prospect.\n\n\"It's electric. People across the whole team are ready. They're in the game and we can't wait to go exploring,\" says New Horizons' principal investigator Prof Alan Stern.\n\nThe probe is famous for making the first ever visit to the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015. To reach Ultima, it has had to push 1.5 billion km deeper into space.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption A blob in the viewfinder: Ultima viewed from New Horizons on 24 December\n\nVirtually nothing is known about this next target for New Horizons, however.\n\nTelescopic measurements indicate it is about 20-30km across, although scientists concede it could actually be two separate entities moving very close to each other, perhaps even touching. The next couple of days will tell.\n\nUltima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of distant, frozen material that orbits far from the Sun and the eight major planets. There are probably hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n\"About one day out we'll turn on all our instruments,\" explains mission scientist Dr Kelsi Singer. \"We'll take black and white images; we'll take colour images. And we'll take compositional information... This is just such a new object because we've never been to an object like this before. It's hard to predict but I'm ready to be surprised by what we find.\"\n\nWhy is New Horizons visiting Ultima Thule?\n\nNasa wanted to explore something beyond Pluto and this object was reachable.\n\nRemarkably, it was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nIt's a Latin phrase that means something like \"a place beyond the known world\".\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its size, it is likely to be composed of a lot of ice, dust and maybe some larger rock fragments, which came together at the dawn of the Solar System.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobate form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nDistant telescopic observations suggested its surface is very dark, with a bit of a red tinge. That darkness (it reflects only about 10% of the light falling on its surface) is the result of having been \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, rotation, composition and environment.\n\nScientists want to know how these far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage caption At this stage, scientists can only speculate what Ultima looks like\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the final hours of the flyby.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed. Features as small as 33m across should be discernible if the pointing of the cameras is spot on.\n\nBecause New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nThe \"hey, I'm healthy and I've got a treasure trove of data\" message should be picked up by Nasa's network of big radio dishes at 15:28 GMT.\n\nImage copyright NASA / JHUAPL / SWRI Image caption The detail in the highest resolution pictures should be better than New Horizons achieved at Pluto\n\nJust how big a challenge is this flyby?\n\nIn some ways, this event is more difficult than the pass of Pluto.\n\nThe object in the viewfinder is almost a hundred times smaller.\n\nNew Horizons will get closer than at Pluto, which is good for image detail; but it means that if the pointing is off, the probe could be sending back pictures of empty space.\n\nAnd this really is a major concern. Because Ultima was only discovered four years ago, its position and movement on the sky are much more uncertain than the coordinates for Pluto.\n\nEvery image taken on approach has been used to refine the navigation and timing models that will be critical to the control of New Horizons during the flyby.\n\nAnd, remember, all this is being done at a distance of 6.62 billion km (4.11 billion miles) from Earth.\n\nAt that separation, radio signals take six hours and eight minutes to reach home.\n\nWhat is more, the data rates are glacial - around 1,000 bits a second.\n\nIt will be late on Tuesday before the first of a few choice images is downlinked, and it will be September 2020 until every last scrap of data from the flyby is pulled off New Horizons.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: Indonesian volcano's dramatic collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46707731", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently\n\nThe scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear.\n\nResearchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea.\n\nThey say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week.\n\nMuch of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement.\n\nIt would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra.\n\nIndonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing.

They were instructed by judicial authorities that she had to see a psychologist at the municipal community centre regularly.\n\nBut then in May this year, her parents brought her back to Leros Hospital, malnourished and faint.\n\nFamily members spoke to the police reluctantly, but an officer got a confession from the parents. Her father was accused of sexually abusing her and physically abusing his other children. His trial is pending.\n\nThese children were not unknown to the authorities. They had been through the child protection system. They had been examined in a hospital. Abuse was confirmed. And yet, a prosecutor decided to remove only the little girl at first and leave her brother with their parents. Then they reversed their decision and returned the girl, while her family had not even been visited by a social worker.\n\nGreece has always lacked a coherent system to efficiently protect minors who are victims of abuse. And in the story of the two children, these problems became painfully obvious.\n\nI have seen cases where four-year-old kids were treated for sexually transmitted rectal HPV for over a year and no investigation had been undertaken to determine how they got it.

However, Giorgos Nikolaidis, a child psychiatrist and head of the Mental Health Department of the Institute of Child Health, is suspicious of such a generalisation, despite his own institution having endured a 50 percent reduction in personnel.\n\n\"The cuts are real enough,\" he says. \"But child protection was underfunded even before the crisis.

A coach with the local basketball team in the town of Rethymno was arrested and convicted of molesting 36 young boys. The abuse had been going on for years and the total number of his victims is believed to be well over 100.\n\nBut no parent, neighbour, teacher, social worker, or police officer ever came forward with a suspicion. After the police and the local prosecutor were eventually alerted by one family, they purposefully, according to their own admission, left him to his devices in order to organise a sting operation that would ensure his conviction.\n\nThis took a full year, throughout which the coach continued to abuse children.\n\nIt took another year before the Institute of Child Health, a semi-independent institution overseen by the Greek Ministry of Health, managed to convince authorities that something should be done for the families. EU funds were redirected and a psychological support unit was set up in Rethymno.\n\nIt didn't last more than two years; as the EU funds ran out, the Ministry of Health decided to shut it down. Nothing has taken its place.\n\nIgnored by successive governments\n\nSuch cases, of which there are many, seem indicative of a structural inability to organise a coherent system of child protection in Greece, child care experts said.\n\nThere are hundreds of services spread across the country that have some measure of participation in child protection; but most operate in isolation from the others, with no protocols for coordinated action.\n\n\"This kind of anarchy where every professional does whatever comes to their mind is destructive,\" Nikolaidis said.\n\n2014414124139195247\n\n\"I have seen cases where four-year-old kids were treated for sexually transmitted rectal HPV for over a year and no investigation had been undertaken to determine how they got it. Because in this type of anarchy, every professional can shut themselves in their own task, however they define it. The dermatologist can just treat the infection and not be concerned with anything else\".\n\nThe Institute of Child Health has developed, with independent funding, a protocol for networking the disparate services and unifying their procedures. It also developed a digital records system for incidents of abuse. \u0392ut despite presenting these to successive Greek governments, they have been ignored.\n\nTo date, all efforts towards coordinating child protection services have similarly failed. One more attempt to streamline the system is in the works by the current government, starting with improving the conditions for child abuse survivors that choose to legally challenge their abusers.\n\nOlga Themeli, an associate professor of forensic psychology at the University of Crete, tells us that according to her research, abused children in Greece are forced to repeat their story to the police \"up to 14 times\".\n\nDespite many cultural similarities when it comes to the treatment of children, Cyprus has already taken the steps that Greece is contemplating only now. The case of a 29-year-old who committed suicide after years of sexual abuse by her foster father, a priest, seems to have been the last straw.\n\n'This is Greece'\n\nLast April, an inter-disciplinary council inaugurated the House of the Child facility in Nicosia, Cyprus, where children's testimonies are recorded in a meticulously efficient procedure.\n\nModelled on similar facilities internationally, where they are known as Child Houses or Child Advocacy Centres, the House of the Child allows for an examination of children by trained professionals, which takes place only once and is as non-invasive as possible.\n\nThemeli is enthusiastic about the prospect of having a House of the Child in Greece.\n\n170222170642666\n\n\"Our prospects are very good,\" she says. A new law stipulates that five such houses will be created throughout Greece. But no actual work has begun on them and the Greek police seem reluctant to submit to the new procedure.\n\n\"This is Greece,\" Konstantina Kostakou, a police officer and psychologist at the Athens Division for Minors, says, implying that things are being done differently. She disputes Themeli's research and believes that children should be brought to police headquarters, so they know \"things are serious\".\n\nEven if the House of the Child programme is implemented, problems with child protection in Greece seem endless. There is no foster care system to speak of, and children who are removed from their families are institutionalised for the long term.\n\nConditions in institutions are poor, child care experts say. One institution for disabled children, in the town of Lechaina in Southern Greece, keeps children in wooden cages or tied to their beds, without releasing them even for brief periods in the day, Nikolaidis says.\n\n\"No court of law has the right to impose such a sentence,\" Nikolaidis said. \"So, who is responsible for doing this to these children?\" As head of a team that is trying to help the children in the Lechaina facility, some of whom have remained tied up literally for years, Nikolaidis is furious that no one is being held accountable.\n\n\n\nMost children, child care experts agree, are abused by those they trust. Such abuse is an assault on the most basic ability to trust another person and to form relationships. So, after the state becomes itself another agent of abuse, where does that leave victims? Themeli's assessment is that \"there is no culture of child protection in Greece\".\n\nUnfortunately, abused children are often inclined to agree with her.\n\nThe Manifold, a team of investigative journalists, are Mariniki Alevizopoulou, Yiannis Baboulias, Yannis-Orestis Papadimitriou, Achilleas Zavallis and Augustine Zenakos.\n\nThis article is based on an investigation financially supported with a grant from the IJ4EU fund.\n\n\n\n"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Cyber attack disrupts newspaper distribution across US", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/cyber-attack-disrupts-newspaper-distribution-181230122915246.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "A cyber attack caused major printing and delivery disruptions on Saturday at the Los Angeles Times and other major US newspapers, including ones owned by the Tribune Publishing Co.\n\nThe cyber attack appeared to originate outside the United States, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a source with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe attack led to distribution delays in the Saturday edition of The Times, Tribune, Sun and other newspapers that share a production platform in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nTribune Publishing, whose newspapers also include the New York Daily News and Orlando Sentinel, said it first detected the malware on Friday and reported it to the FBI.\n\nHowever, Tribune Publishing's website was not affected and no customer information was compromised, according to the statement issued by the company on Saturday.\n\n\"This issue has affected the timeliness and in some cases, the completeness of our printed newspaper,\" Tribune Publishing spokesperson Marisa Kollias said in a statement. \"Our websites and mobile applications, however, have not been impacted.\"\n\nThe West Coast editions of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which are printed on the shared production platform, were hit as well, the Los Angeles Times said.\n\nThe LA Times said Saturday that the attack, which was first assumed to have been a server outage, hit a computer network at Tribune Publishing which is connected to the production and printing process of multiple newspapers around the country.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThe report said it could not provide firm numbers on how many subscribers were impacted, but a majority of LA Times customers received their papers on Saturday morning, albeit several hours late.\n\nMost San Diego Union-Tribune subscribers were without a newspaper on Saturday as the virus infected the company's business systems and hobbled its ability to publish, the paper's editor and publisher Jeff Light wrote on its website.\n\n\"We believe the intention of the attack was to disable infrastructure, more specifically servers, as opposed to looking to steal information,\" the LA Times quoted a source with knowledge of the situation as saying.\n\nThe paper cited officials as saying it was too soon to know whether it was carried out by state or non-state actors.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said it was studying the situation. \"We are aware of reports of a potential cyber incident affecting several news outlets, and are working with our government and industry partners to better understand the situation,\" Katie Waldman said in a statement.\n\nAn internal memo from Tribune's CEO Justin Dearborn on Saturday referenced \"malware\" and said, \"we are making progress with this issue\"."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Leaders of a national campaign to ban the practice are hopeful that at least four more states \u2014 Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts and New York \u2014 will join the ranks in the upcoming legislative sessions.\n\n\n\n\"We'd be disappointed if we don't get those this year \u2014 they're overdue,\" said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups campaigning to impose bans in all 50 states.\n\n\n\nThe campaign has gained momentum in recent months thanks to the national release of two films dramatizing the experiences of youths who went through conversion therapy \u2014 The Miseducation of Cameron Post and the higher-profile Boy Erased starring Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe.\n\nJoining 'in droves'\n\nSam Brinton of the Trevor Project, another of groups leading the ban campaign, said thousands of people have signed up to assist the effort since Boy Erased was released on Nov. 2.\n\n\n\n\"They're recognizing this is still a problem and joining our campaigns in droves,\" said Brinton, a child of Baptist missionary parents who has written about agonizing conversion therapy sessions experienced as an adolescent in Florida.\n\n\n\nBrinton recalls being bound to a table by the therapist for applications of ice, heat and electricity.\n\n\n\nJust four days after the Boy Erased release came the midterm elections, which altered the partisan political dynamic at several statehouses and boosted prospects for conversion therapy bans.\n\nIn three of the states now being targeted, previous efforts to enact a ban gained some bipartisan support but were thwarted by powerful Republicans. In Maine, a bill was vetoed last year by GOP Gov. Paul LePage. In New York and Colorado, bills approved in the Democratic-led lower chambers of the legislature died in the Republican-controlled state senates.\n\n\n\nIn January, however, a Democrat will succeed LePage as Maine's governor, and Democrats will have control of both legislative chambers in New York and in Colorado, where gay Gov.-elect Jared Polis is believed eager to sign a ban.\n\nA lead sponsor of the New York ban bill, Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman, predicted passage would be \"straightforward\" now that his party controls the Senate.\n\n\n\n\"For a lot of my colleagues, they consider conversion therapy to be child abuse,\" he said.\n\nOutlook in Massachusetts\n\n\n\nIn Massachusetts, both legislative chambers voted last year in support of a ban but were unable to reconcile different versions of the measure before adjournment. Chances of passage in 2019 are considered strong, and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who was re-elected, is viewed as likely to sign such a measure given his strong support for LGBT rights.\n\n\n\nMore Republican governors like Baker are getting behind the bans, reflecting activists' belief that opposition to conversion therapy is increasingly bipartisan.\n\n\n\nBills proposing bans are pending or anticipated in several GOP-controlled legislatures, including Florida, Ohio and Utah. LGBT activists are particularly intrigued by Utah because of the possibility that the powerful Mormon church, which in the past supported conversion therapy, might endorse a bill to ban the practice for minors.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, the proposed ban faces long odds in the legislature in 2019, but activists note that about 20 Florida cities and counties have passed local bans \u2014 more than in any other state.\n\n\n\nIn Ohio, supporters of a bill that would ban conversion therapy for minors realize they have an uphill fight in a legislature with GOP supermajorities.\n\n\n\nStill, Sen. Charleta Tavares, a Columbus Democrat, believes her proposal got \"new legs\" in November. That's when the state board overseeing counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists warned the 40,000 professionals it regulates that anyone found practicing conversion therapy on LGBT patients could lose his or her license.\n\n\n\n\"I am glad to see that our state boards are carrying this movement, regardless of the inaction by our General Assembly,\" Tavares said.\n\n\n\nFor now, LGBT activists are not seeking to ban conversion therapy for adults. A gay California legislator, Evan Low, withdrew a bill he introduced earlier this year that would have declared conversion therapy a fraudulent practice and banned commercial use of it for adults and minors. Some opponents had threatened to sue to block the bill, saying it would jeopardize free speech and free exercise of religion.\n\n\u200bModel for movie\n\n\n\nLow says he may try again after revising his bill. If so, his arguments could be bolstered by input from John Smid, the real-life model for the Boy Erased character who ran a coercive conversion therapy program.\n\n\n\nFor years, Smid was director of Tennessee-based Love in Action, a ministry that operated such a program. Smid left the organization in 2008. He subsequently renounced the concept that sexual orientation could be changed and apologized for any harm he had caused. In 2014, he married his same-sex partner, with whom he lives in Texas.\n\n\n\nSmid recently cooperated with a law firm as it compiled a report about Love in Action for the Washington-based Mattachine Society, which studies past instances of anti-LGBT persecution.\n\n\n\nOne of the report's co-authors, Lisa Linsky, said Smid depicted Love in Action as \"a complete and utter failure,\" with none of its participants actually changing sexual orientation."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Continues Wall Campaign as Shutdown Reaches Day 8", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-continues-wall-campaign-as-shutdown-reaches-day-8/4721262.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump continued Saturday to stress the need for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall as a partial government shutdown, triggered by a stalemate over funding for the project, entered its eighth day.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Trump said Democrats should take the initiative on ending the shutdown, saying, \u201cI am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal\u201d on border security.\n\nA budget standoff remains between Trump, who wants $5 billion in wall funding, and Democratic lawmakers, who back a modest increase in overall border security funding but resolutely oppose a wall.\n\n\u200bClose border, cut aid\n\nIn a series of tweets Friday, Trump again threatened to close the entire U.S.-Mexico border and cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if Congress failed to give him money to fund the wall.

We\u2019re seeing them play out, in real time, on our television screens and in our newspaper headlines,\u201d Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, told HuffPost.\n\nHe noted that the \u201crecord floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires\u201d as well as \u201csuperstorms\u201d seen over the past couple years have \u201cas an underlying cause, the effects of climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the actions necessary to avert ever-more catastrophic climate change impacts, time is running out,\u201d Mann added.\n\nHere are some of the year\u2019s major natural disasters that show the devastation of climate change is on our doorstep.\n\n1. The deadliest wildfire in California history wiped out a town.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A mobile home park retirement community in Paradise was burned to ashes in the Camp fire.\n\nThe Camp fire that wiped out the Northern California community of Paradise in November was the deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s history, killing 85 people. It was also California\u2019s most destructive wildfire, destroying nearly 14,000 homes. Its death toll far surpassed that of the devastating fires in Sonoma and Napa counties last year, which left 44 people dead.\n\nAfter Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke visited Paradise in November, he acknowledged that the \u201c[fire] season is getting longer, the temperatures are getting hotter,\u201d and noted this was his fourth visit in a year to California in response to wildfires. \u201cEach trip, I say this is the worst fire I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here today, and this is the worst I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nYet he managed not to say the words \u201cclimate change\u201d once, noting that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of reasons for a fire\u201d and \u201cnow is not the time to point fingers.\u201d\n\n2. California also saw its largest ever wildfire.\n\nJustin Sullivan via Getty Images Firefighters battle the Mendocino Complex fire in Northern California.\n\nFrom late July into August, the Mendocino Complex fire burned over 450,000 acres in Northern California, becoming the largest wildfire in state history. It surpassed last December\u2019s Thomas fire, which previously held the record by burning over 280,000 acres in Southern California.\n\nAs of early December, California\u2019s wildfires had burned more than 2 1/2 times as much area as they did by the same time last year. They\u2019ve scorched more than 875,000 acres this year \u2015 eclipsing the five-year average of about 230,000 acres burned.\n\nLast year, which at the time was record-breaking, Cal Fire deputy chief Scott McLean had told HuffPost: \u201cThis is one of the worst fire years.\u201d\n\nThis year he told HuffPost in November: \u201cWe\u2019ve done away with the \u2018new\u2019 part of the \u2018new normal,\u2019\u201d referring to the worsening fires in the state. He said the recent Camp fire had spread so fast that its flames burned up \u201cthe length of a football field in the matter of a second or two.\u201d\n\n3. Two devastating hurricanes hit the East Coast within a month.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images Debris from Hurricane Michael along the canal in Mexico Beach, Florida.\n\nHurricane Florence hit the Carolinas in September, killing more than 50 people and bringing catastrophic damage along the coast followed by severe inland flooding.\n\nLess than a month later, another major storm hit the Southeast: Hurricane Michael barreled into Florida, killing nearly four dozen people in Florida alone and wrecking entire coastal communities. The storm broke records as the first of its size to strike the Florida Panhandle since records began in 1851, according to The Washington Post and Weather.com.\n\nThe catastrophic hurricanes came almost exactly a year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, leaving the island without power for months and killing thousands.\n\n4. Historic rains triggered floods and landslides in Hawaii.\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images Floodwaters surround a baseball scoreboard during flooding from Tropical Storm Lane on the Big Island, in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nIn April, torrential rains poured down on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, triggering flooding and landslides and causing hundreds to evacuate their homes. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst natural disaster to occur on Kauai in 25 years,\u201d Sarah Blane, chief of staff to Kauai\u2019s mayor, told HuffPost.\n\nMonths later, in August, Hurricane Lane, which was later downgraded to a tropical storm, tore through the Hawaiian Islands, dumping so much water on Hawaii that it earned a spot among the most extreme rainfall events on record in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. The NWS pegged its rainfall as the third highest from a tropical cyclone in the U.S. since 1950. The No. 1 spot is held by Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Texas communities last year.\n\nLane triggered flash flooding across the Big Island, and also bore down on Oahu and Maui.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for hurricanes to hit Hawaii, but scientists warn that warmer ocean temperatures linked to climate change could make such events more common.\n\n5. A historic monsoon in India killed hundreds and displaced thousands.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A man stands in his house amid flood waters in Kerala, India \u2014 the worst monsoon flooding in a century in the southern Indian state.\n\nIn August, a severe monsoon hit the southern Indian state of Kerala, with heavy rains causing extensive flooding, landslides and building collapses. Hundreds of people died and thousands were left stranded on rooftops for days.\n\nWhile monsoon floods occur every year in India, the severity of this year\u2019s rainfall in Kerala was unprecedented.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing something that has never happened before in the history of Kerala,\u201d the state\u2019s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, told reporters.\n\n6. Record rains in Japan triggered deadly landslides and flooding.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Damaged houses and a mud-covered road in the aftermath of heavy rains in Hiroshima, southwestern Japan.\n\nTorrential rains bore down on southwest Japan in July, causing rivers to overflow, setting off landslides, and killing more than 200 people. Millions were forced to flee their homes.\n\nThe country got three times more precipitation than was normal for July, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never experienced this kind of rain before,\u201d a Japanese Meteorological Agency official told reporters. \u201cThis is a situation of extreme danger.\u201d\n\n7. A super typhoon hit a U.S. territory as the second strongest storm ever on U.S. soil.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A satellite image shows Typhoon Yutu east of Guam, set to cross over the U.S. commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands with damaging winds.\n\nIn October, super Typhoon Yutu hit the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory in the Pacific. It was one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones to make landfall anywhere in the world.\n\nWith winds of up to 180 mph, it was the most powerful storm worldwide this year and the second strongest ever to hit U.S. soil, after the 1935 Labor Day hurricane in the Florida Keys."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "FBI Collected Fake Green Cards Allegedly Supplied By Trump Golf Club Managers: Report", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-collects-fake-green-cards-allegedly-supplied-by-trump-club-managers-say-reports_us_5c283ceae4b0407e908346c3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "The FBI and New Jersey investigators have collected employment documents and information allegedly provided to immigrants not authorized to work by supervisors at President Donald Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, The Washington Post reported Saturday.\n\nNewark attorney Anibal Romero told the newspaper that he turned over fake permanent resident green cards and fraudulent Social Security numbers that he said were given to one of his clients by managers at the Trump National Golf Club.

With a staunch ally in the White House and GOP majorities in both branches of Congress, at least through the end of the year, the NRA seemed positioned to advance its pro-gun agenda over the next 12 months, further cementing its standing as one of the nation\u2019s most politically influential organizations.\n\nInstead, in the waning days of 2018, the NRA now appears to be worse off than it has been in years. The group has made no progress on its federal legislative priorities, and reportedly faces stiff financial headwinds, as well as the looming threat of a pair of explosive scandals involving Russian money and influence.\n\nPerhaps more concerning for the NRA, this year made clear that it\u2019s losing its stranglehold on the conversation around firearms in the U.S. The February school shooting in Parkland, Florida, led to surging momentum in favor of stronger gun laws. A student-led movement emerged in response, quickly singling out the NRA as its chief enemy, and ultimately helping gun safety candidates win victories in the midterm elections. Doctors also jumped into the anti-NRA fray later in the year, publicly thumping the group over its demands that the medical community keep quiet on issues of gun violence.\n\nDespite the challenges for the NRA, experts say it\u2019s too early to know if 2018 was merely a blip or a sign of worse things to come. But as the group looks to claw back power in 2019, here are some of the issues it\u2019s up against.\n\nNoam Galai via Getty Images An anti-gun violence display is seen in the months after the Parkland shooting. The NRA took a hit this year amid a new wave of activism in support of stronger gun laws.\n\nLosing Its Grip\n\nFor more than two decades, the NRA has been the most powerful force in the gun debate. The NRA\u2019s opposition has meanwhile ebbed and flowed, with gun reform advocacy typically swelling after high-profile shootings and subsiding over time, sometimes without much progress to show for it.\n\nThat pattern was once again put to the test in 2018. After the Parkland shooting, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and around the country organized massive nationwide demonstrations demanding action. The protests may not have moved Congress, but change did come elsewhere \u2015 in 2018 alone, 27 states passed 67 new gun safety laws, according to a tally by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Many of those measures passed with support from Republicans.\n\nThe youth-led movement was also able to help provide a spark for sustained momentum in favor of gun reform. Polling suggested there was still substantial enthusiasm around the issue this election season, especially among suburban voters. And for the first time ever this midterm election, gun safety organizations actually outspent the NRA, as the pro-gun group\u2019s outlays fell sharply this cycle.\n\nAfter years of dominance on the issue of firearms, a formidable foe may finally have emerged to challenge the NRA\u2019s supremacy, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland who\u2019s written extensively on gun policy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of been cut down to size and now it\u2019s a much more even contest,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the gun safety groups have been after \u2015 a way to rectify the structural imbalance that has favored the NRA politically.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur via Getty Images Student organizers address the crowd at the March For Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C. The movement has helped \"rectify the structural imbalance that has favored the NRA,\" said Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland.\n\nNew Calls For Action\n\nThe unprecedented activity by gun safety groups this election season proved to be a worthy investment, with a dozens of so-called \u201cgun sense\u201d candidates winning key congressional races and helping Democrats retake the House.\n\n\u201cThe midterm elections demonstrated that a growing number of candidates could campaign expressly on supporting stronger gun laws, including in states that are not particularly liberal, and win on that campaign without suffering bad consequences,\u201d Spitzer said.\n\nDemocratic leaders have since vowed to take swift action on gun reform in the new congressional session, likely beginning with a bill to require federal background checks on all firearm sales. With Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans still in control of the Senate, such a proposal would have very little chance of becoming law. But even a House vote could provide fuel for gun safety advocates and serve as a wedge issue for Democrats who feel the political landscape on guns has shifted in their favor.\n\nIn effect, they could follow a path like the one House Republicans took when they voted repeatedly to repeal Obamacare, even while Democrats controlled the Senate and Barack Obama was president, said Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and an expert on gun policy.\n\n\u201cRepublicans did it over and over again, it was a symbolic thing, it appealed to voters, they knew it wasn\u2019t going to get adopted, but they took 70 something votes on it anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nBut such a strategy could also be risky, as it would likely provide the NRA with fodder to mobilize its supporters ahead of the 2020, said Scott Melzer, a professor at Albion College who\u2019s written about the history of the gun rights movement.\n\n\u201cThe NRA is especially prone to identifying bogeymen, or in this case, a bogeywoman in [Speaker of the House-elect] Nancy Pelosi, who will serve as the face of the threat to gun rights,\u201d said Melzer. \u201cThat\u2019s been the playbook for 20-plus years and it\u2019s been highly effective.\u201d\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images House Democrats have nominated Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to serve as the next speaker of the House. The NRA will likely target her publicly if Democrats take up new gun control legislation this session.\n\nNRA In The Red\n\nThe NRA has faced serious questions about its long-term fiscal health in recent months, after a string of reports showing falling membership dues, sharp declines in revenue, and plummeting election spending in the midterms following a record high in 2016.\n\nFinancial filings for nonprofits like the NRA can be slow-moving and sparse, so they don\u2019t always provide the most detailed or up-to-date reading on a group\u2019s financial situation. But the NRA\u2019s 2017 filing, just revealed last month, suggests they have plenty to be worried about.\n\nThe documents showed the NRA was $31.8 million in the red at the end of last year, thanks in large part to slower cash flow. The negative balance was a 10-year low, according to Ohio State University professor Brian Mittendorf, who recently published an analysis on the group\u2019s finances. The NRA was also among just 7 percent of U.S. nonprofits that ended 2017 with a negative balance, Mittendorf found.\n\nBut again, it\u2019s not clear how much the NRA\u2019s financial picture may have changed over the course of 2018. There were some indications that the group may have seen a membership bump in the months after the Parkland shooting.\n\nIn March, the first full month after Parkland, the NRA\u2019s Political Victory Fund was able to raise $2.4 million, the entity\u2019s largest single-month haul this century. While that achievement may show the NRA still has fundraising chops, the Political Victory Fund is supposed to spend money on behalf of candidates and campaigns during elections. And as we now know, the NRA\u2019s overall election spending this cycle ended up at just a fraction of previous totals.\n\nA Russian Cloud\n\nThe NRA has spent most of 2018 under intense scrutiny over a set of still-developing scandals involving Russian money and influence.\n\nThe first broke in January, with reports that the FBI was probing whether Alexander Torshin, a Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin, had illegally funneled money through the NRA to the Trump campaign and into other races. Under U.S. law, it is illegal to use foreign money to influence federal elections. The Federal Election Commission has also reportedly launched an investigation into the matter.\n\nTorshin and the NRA have both denied any wrongdoing. But as McClatchy has reported extensively, a number of influential Russians, including Torshin and other allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had been cultivating ties with top NRA figures in the years leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of convicted Russian spy Maria Butina, who this month pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. while acting as an agent of the Russian Federation.\n\nButina, a Russian gun rights activist, admitted to taking orders from Torshin while working to \u201cestablish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics.\u201d As part of her plot, Butina attended NRA events and sought to ingratiate herself with NRA officials. Her sentencing is set for February. Torshin meanwhile recently quietly resigned from his position at the Russian central bank.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will come of these scandals, or whether they\u2019ll end up further damaging the NRA. But there\u2019s also more controversy for the NRA to be concerned about. In recent weeks new allegations have emerged charging that the NRA and Trump campaign illegally coordinated advertising in the final days of the 2016 election.\n\nFacebook Convicted Russian agent Maria Butina is seen with NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre in 2014. The NRA remains under a cloud of scrutiny stemming from a set of still-developing scandals.\n\nWhat Now?\n\nDespite the NRA\u2019s tough year, experts cautioned against premature readings of the group\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cThe NRA remains one of the most powerful political organizations in America,\u201d said Winkler. \u201cThere should be no mistake about that.\u201d\n\nWinkler pointed to Congress as evidence of the NRA\u2019s enduring clout. Lawmakers may not have passed new pro-gun laws in 2018, but they also didn\u2019t vote on a bump stock ban, he said, a measure that the NRA opposed but that the majority of Americans supported. (The Justice Department recently moved to outlaw the firearm accessories with a policy change, effectively circumventing the legislative process.)\n\nIn fact, the only gun legislation Congress has voted on since the Las Vegas shooting was a package containing a top NRA priority \u2015 a measure to allow concealed carry license holders to legally carry their handguns in other states. The House passed the bill largely along party lines, but the Senate didn\u2019t take it up.\n\nRegardless of how bad 2018 proves to be for the NRA, the group is likely to face structural challenges as it tries to bounce back in 2019 and beyond.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to attract women, they\u2019re not going to attract ethnic minorities, they\u2019re not going to attract mainstream Americans, because they\u2019re too far down the path of kind of rabid, apocalyptic, angry, defensive style that has increasingly been their meat and potatoes for 20 years,\u201d said Spitzer. \u201cI don\u2019t think the needle\u2019s going to move a whole lot in the year to come.\u201d\n\nStill, others are more skeptical that the NRA\u2019s struggles are likely to continue over the longer term. This year certainly showed there\u2019s a crack in the NRA\u2019s armor, said Melzer. But what happens next will ultimately depend on whether the NRA\u2019s opponents can effectively exploit that newly exposed weakness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of whether or not the NRA really is going to be opposed by a gun control movement that can shepherd the same kinds of resources that it historically has in terms of money and people and power,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "John Kelly Blames Jeff Sessions For Family Separation Policy: 'He Surprised Us'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kelly-jeff-sessions-family-separation_us_5c28d01ae4b08aaf7a917c37", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly says former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is to blame for the Trump administration\u2019s controversial \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy, which separated children from parents who illegally crossed into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nKelly spoke out about the policy \u2015 as well as his tumultuous tenure in the White House \u2015 in an interview published in The Los Angeles Times on Sunday.\n\nThe retired Marine general told the Times that the White House had been caught off guard by Sessions\u2019 family separation announcement in April.\n\nSessions \u201cwas the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained and the family separation,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe surprised us.\u201d\n\nWithout singling out anyone, Kelly blasted the administration for failing to anticipate the massive public outcry sparked by the policy.

This year, abortion opponents have pushed legislation aimed at drawing lawsuits, with the hope those cases will eventually land in front of the Supreme Court and test Roe v. Wade.\n\nEvery year, anti-abortion legislators and legislatures chip away at reproductive rights, and 2018 brought a wave of extreme restrictions from lawmakers determined to topple Roe v. Wade. This year, as of Dec. 11, 22 abortion restrictions were passed nationwide \u2014 a number that will likely edge up to 24 by the time 2019 begins.\n\nOn the surface, that number looks pretty good. It\u2019s the fewest abortion restrictions passed in a single year in more than a decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and promotes reproductive health policy. And for the first time in recent years, the number of proactive reproductive health policies \u2014 measures that make it easier for women to access abortion services and birth control, for example \u2014 outpaced the number of restrictions.\n\nAnd yet ... the laws that legislators pushed through in 2018 and the rhetoric they used were extreme and aggressive in ways that deeply unsettled reproductive rights advocates, said Elizabeth Nash, the senior state issues manager at Guttmacher, particularly given the Supreme Court\u2019s new conservative majority. Furthermore, new laws don\u2019t tell the full picture as some states tried to resurrect old anti-abortion legislation with that new conservative majority mind.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw this year was a lower number of enacted restrictions,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBut some of these are so extreme that it\u2019s a shift in the type of restrictions we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s not captured in the pure number.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how anti-abortion legislators targeted abortion access in 2018.\n\nThey instituted restrictions that make it really hard \u2014 often impossible \u2014 for women to get abortions within a legal time frame\n\nThe most extreme abortion restriction of 2018 came out of Iowa, which banned abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 at around six weeks gestation \u2014 except in cases of rape or incest or if the woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nSix weeks is so early in a pregnancy that a woman might not know she\u2019s pregnant yet; the law bans abortion before many women even realize they\u2019ve missed a period. And even if they know they\u2019re pregnant before six weeks, it leaves virtually no time for them to find an abortion provider, book an appointment, come up with the money they need and tackle any of the many other logistical hurdles women must contend with.\n\nCutting off access to abortion at a certain point in pregnancy is nothing new, Nash said, but the drive to do it earlier and earlier is a shift toward the extreme. In past years, states focused on banning abortions at 20 weeks gestation, or about the halfway point in a woman\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 not in the first few weeks.\n\nThat Iowa law is tied up in the courts, meaning it is not in effect, but Ohio came close to enacting a similar bill, which Gov. John Kasich vetoed just before Christmas. Likewise, Mississippi is one of two states that passed a ban on most abortions after the 15-week mark. It too has been blocked by the courts, but the state\u2019s attorney general has said he will appeal.\n\n\u201cIn some states that already have so many restrictions on the books, all that is left is to ban abortion,\u201d Nash argued. \u201cThey\u2019ve restricted access to the extent that\u2019s possible, so now the next big leap is an early abortion ban.\u201d\n\nThey played on concerns about discrimination in order to stigmatize women who seek abortions\n\nIn the fall, Indiana\u2019s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to overrule two previous court decisions blocking a 2016 state law that, among other things, barred women from getting an abortion based on the race or gender of a fetus or in cases in which a fetus has a disability.\n\nThat sort of legislation falls under the broad umbrella of what Nash called \u201creason bans,\u201d which prohibit women from terminating a pregnancy based on things like sex or race. Anti-abortion legislators argue they\u2019re solely meant to prohibit discrimination, but reproductive rights advocates call BS. They say they\u2019re nothing more than an effort to further limit abortion access while fueling stigma by legally requiring doctors to question their patients\u2019 motives.\n\nLast year Ohio\u2019s governor signed a similar bill that would make it a felony for doctors to perform an abortion for any woman whose fetus has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. Some parents of children with Down syndrome have supported the measure, while others have criticized what they see as a bad faith effort from anti-abortion lawmakers. For now, it too is tied up in court.\n\n\u201cIf [legislators] really cared about making the community better for my daughter, they\u2019d provide more funding for programs that help her. They\u2019d help improve inclusion in schools. They\u2019d help educate parents that Down syndrome doesn\u2019t have to be scary,\u201d one woman told HuffPost last March. \u201cI have a whole bunch of issues I would love to have legislators\u2019 help with.\u201d\n\nThey used gruesome, imprecise language to paint a safe and common method of abortion as cruel and barbaric\n\nBans on dilation and evacuation procedures, one of the most common ways doctors perform second-trimester abortions, gained traction once again in 2018. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said D&Es, as they\u2019re often called, are a safe way to remove the contents of the uterus and can be done as an outpatient surgery with general or regional anesthesia \u2014 but legislators have used inflammatory language painting it as a barbarous act.\n\nFor example, in Kentucky, which passed a 2018 ban on D&E abortions, a bill didn\u2019t say \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d anywhere. Instead, it banned procedures that cause \u201cbodily dismemberment,\u201d \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201chuman vivisection.\u201d And that rhetoric, Nash said, represents a real shift.\n\n\u201cThe language isn\u2019t about protecting health or fetal rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe language is simply trying to paint the procedure as something dangerous, something terrible that no one would ever want to undergo. And oh, by the way, it would make it very hard if not impossible to access abortion after 15 weeks, so that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nThey wrote laws they knew would be challenged in court in a big and public way, with the goal of toppling Roe v. Wade\n\nFor Nash, perhaps the most worrisome shift of 2018 was the ramping up of likely unconstitutional legislation aimed at drawing lawsuits, with the hope those cases will eventually land in front of the Supreme Court and test Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said while campaigning for the presidency that he believed the landmark decision would be overturned \u201cautomatically\u201d because it was his intention to put several conservative judges on the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on abortion rights, retired in June, and now two of Trump\u2019s appointees sit on the court.\n\n\u201cYou have states across the country that are essentially lining up with prefiled abortion bans,\u201d Nash said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Trauma Is The Norm For Many New Orleans Kids.

The 27 kids enrolled in the center\u2019s program have some of the most extreme behavior needs in the city, often stemming from trauma or mental illness. A typical student may have exhibited verbal and physical aggression, caused property damage or refused to do classwork.

About 18 percent reported witnessing a murder. And more than half said that someone close to them had been murdered.\n\nThe survey found that children in New Orleans displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at more than three times the national average.\n\nThe center, which was known as the Therapeutic Day Program until Dec. 1, is a rare lifeline to the few who get in. When it opened in 2015, it was the first school of its kind in New Orleans, offering a blend of traditional classes like math and English, as well as therapy and counseling. In a city where student mental health resources remain scant, there are few places like it today.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Misty Johnson does a warm-up activity with Jordan Coughlin, a math teacher at the Center for Resilience.\n\nKids who arrive at the center are usually three grade levels behind in math and reading, said Williams, who has a background in special education and designed the school\u2019s curriculum. Her goal is to get kids back into the mainstream school system. Students attend the center for an average of 15 months.\n\nNine-year-old Misty Johnson, who has ADHD and bipolar disorder, has been in the program for two years. Her mom, Dawn Johnson, said Misty is almost ready to return to a charter elementary school.\n\nJohnson admitted that she was worried when she first visited the center. \u201cThe other kids were just like Misty,\u201d she said, adding that she thought it might be overwhelming for her daughter.\n\nOver time, however, she saw improvements in Misty\u2019s behavior and academics. Many of the classes here are tiny; some have just two students. Misty was getting lots of one-on-one attention. The school called Johnson regularly to give updates.\n\nThis year the center started assigning students a home base room, where they begin their day with breakfast. The home base is meant to be a safe room, and students may return there during the day if they need to opt out of a class or activity. In a typical school, students don\u2019t usually have the option to walk out of class if they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Abel Thompson, a second-grader, displays his newly crafted Santa Claus beard. In addition to academic offerings, various activities \u2014 from sports to play to art \u2014 are integrated into a school day at the Center for Resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always thinking about how do we minimize power struggles,\u201d Williams said. The home base room really helped them with that, she added. From August to November last year, the center had 235 behavioral incidents requiring an adult crisis response, she said. This year in the same time frame, there were 77. The home base rooms were partly responsible for that, she said.\n\nDespite the high rate of turnover at the center, most kids who apply for a spot at the tiny school never get in.\n\nOnly 45 kids have attended since the school opened.

All That's Missing Is Proof.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ambrosia-young-blood-plasma-jesse-karmazin_us_5c1bbafce4b0407e9078373c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "Jesse Karmazin, the 34-year-old founder of the startup Ambrosia, had a pitch journalists couldn\u2019t resist: For a fee, he could help his clients combat aging and its related ills with infusions of blood plasma from the young. Teen donors, vampiric undertones, a serious-sounding study, an $8,000-per-person price tag and rumors that venture capitalist Peter Thiel might be interested earned Ambrosia more than 100 press mentions in just two years.\n\nThe effects of young plasma, Karmazin told reporters, were astounding. Just one infusion \u201cdramatically improves people\u2019s appearance, their memory and their strength,\u201d he told one reporter. \u201cI want to be clear, at this point, it works. It reverses aging,\u201d he told another. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality but I think it comes pretty close,\u201d he told a third, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like plastic surgery from the inside out.\u201d\n\nThe free publicity helped Ambrosia attract clients: One hundred and four people paid to receive plasma from 16- to 25-year-old donors as part of Ambrosia\u2019s participant-funded study, Karmazin told HuffPost.\n\nBut despite declaring the study a success and announcing plans this week to accept new clients, Karmazin never showed any proof that the transfusions actually helped people. In the media, he touted impressive results, but almost a year after his study officially concluded in January 2018, he hasn\u2019t released them. Scientists have criticized the study as flawed and the procedure as medically unnecessary and not without risk; in rare cases, transfusion complications can be fatal. One of the doctors Karmazin hired had previously been disciplined by a state medical board for unprofessional conduct. Karmazin himself cannot legally practice medicine in any state; he is explicitly prohibited from practicing in Massachusetts by authorities. Ambrosia\u2019s president and chief operating officer quietly left the company in late December, leaving Karmazin as the sole employee. And the only patient who spoke publicly about Ambrosia\u2019s transfusions \u2014 treatments he hoped would help him live healthier into old age \u2014 died at 65 after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nKarmazin couldn\u2019t comment on individual patients but said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment.\n\n[People] could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment. Phuoc Le, physician and global health specialist\n\nHuffPost found that at least some of Karmazin\u2019s young plasma came from a nonprofit blood bank in Texas that recruited teenage donors for \u201csaving lives,\u201d but noted on a consent form that their blood components could also be used for \u201cany other medical purpose.\u201d\n\nThe bank abruptly decided to stop selling young plasma after HuffPost reached out, according to an employee email.\n\nAmbrosia, which declined to comment on whether the company has any investors, is only one of many firms investigating how to help people feel younger for longer. But Ambrosia\u2019s ability to attract paying clients and years of positive press coverage \u2014 without providing scientific data to back up its claims \u2014 shows just how easy it can be for promises to outpace the research when Silicon Valley gold-chasing mixes with Americans\u2019 fear of death.\n\n\u201cYou can easily imagine a situation where somebody who\u2019s vulnerable, and not wealthy, and not healthy, and may be desperate ... would potentially feel like they have no option but to spend this money,\u201d said Phuoc Le, a physician and global health specialist who teaches at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThey could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctor Karmazin\n\nKarmazin was born in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and attended Princeton University, where he became a highly accomplished rower, going on to win a silver medal in the Paralympic Games in Beijing in 2008. He attended Stanford Medical School and participated in labs that focused on longevity and stem cell biology. His experience as an athlete \u2014 and feeling slower athletically after turning 30 \u2014 influenced his desire to work on aging as a treatable condition. After graduating in 2014, Karmazin started a residency at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston with a plan to eventually specialize in psychiatry. But as Karmazin tells it, he didn\u2019t like working the long hours and felt he didn\u2019t have time to pursue his other interests, transfusions and aging, in addition to general practice, so he left his residency in 2016 to start Ambrosia.\n\nThere is an asterisk to that story: On Feb. 29, 2016, Karmazin and his attorney signed a voluntary agreement with Massachusetts officials in which he promised to immediately stop practicing medicine in the state. Karmazin told HuffPost he signed the paperwork because he left his residency early, that doing so was \u201cpretty routine,\u201d there were no additional circumstances that he was aware of and that\u2019s all he knew. That account seems unlikely. Karmazin was practicing under a limited license; such a license terminates automatically if a physician leaves a residency program early for any reason, according to George Zachos, the executive director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine. The board wouldn\u2019t typically pursue such an agreement with a limited licensee for leaving a residency early, Zachos said. Such a public agreement is used to protect patient safety. Last year, only 12 physicians in Massachusetts reached similar deals.\n\nThe board\u2019s review is confidential, but a representative noted the circumstances that led to the agreement were unrelated to Karmazin\u2019s work with Ambrosia or xVitality Sciences, a separate \u201crejuvenation\u201d project he also worked on.\n\nKarmazin, who introduces himself as \u201cDr. Karmazin,\u201d moved forward with Ambrosia after signing that agreement. He said he got the idea for young plasma transfusions from several studies in which young and old mice were surgically conjoined in order to examine the effects of mixing their blood. In some cases, the older mice became temporarily stronger and showed slight improvements to their health. Karmazin believed those results could be replicated in humans.\n\nMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood, but there is no scientific evidence for that. Irina Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nScientists have questioned Karmazin\u2019s interpretation of the data. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who led conjoined-mice tests noticed small positive changes in older animals\u2019 muscles, livers and brains. But the more important finding was the significant decline in the health of the younger animals. For the older animals, the young blood was largely diluted by the old blood.\n\n\u201cThere was much more negative effect from the stuff in the old blood than there was positive effect from the stuff in the young blood,\u201d said Irina Conboy, an aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley, who compared young blood transfusions to taking \u201ca pile of rotten bananas\u201d and throwing \u201cone good one\u201d on top. \u201cMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is no scientific evidence for that.\u201d\n\nKarmazin went ahead anyway: In the summer of 2016, he announced that he would charge people ages 35 and older $8,000 each for about 2 liters of young plasma as part of what he called a \u201cclinical trial.\u201d Karmazin didn\u2019t feel the need to go through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug approval process, as plasma transfusions are already a well-established procedure. Most of the time, however, they are used to treat patients who have specific health issues, not carried out to potentially make people feel younger.\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial whipped up the flurry of press coverage that doubled as free advertising, and in some cases, suggested inaccurately that people were drinking young blood. But what really got people talking about Ambrosia was a report that Peter Thiel, the tech entrepreneur billionaire, was interested in young blood. Karmazin himself appears to have made the explicit connection to Ambrosia. In 2016, he told an Inc. magazine reporter that Jason Camm, chief medical officer at Thiel Capital, had contacted him to express interest in Ambrosia. It\u2019s not clear whether Camm was reaching out on Thiel\u2019s behalf, or how extensive the alleged contact was. But the story prompted a wave of Thiel-vampire insinuations in the media. Later, in an interview with TechCrunch, Karmazin completely denied having contact with anyone from Thiel Capital, raising questions about who wanted to quash the story.\n\nCamm and Thiel Capital did not respond to requests for comment. In November, Thiel said at the New York Times DealBook conference: \u201cOn the record. I\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d He also said he\u2019s never injected himself with young blood. Karmazin reiterated to HuffPost that he\u2019s not in any contact with Thiel. When asked why his story appears to have changed, Karmazin repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nSweet Little 16-Year-Old Plasma\n\nTo launch his study, Karmazin needed plasma, the liquid part of blood, from young people. He needed a lot of it \u2014 Ambrosia performed more than 150 roughly 2-liter transfusions (some clients reportedly returned for multiple treatments), according to Karmazin, which would have required at least 80 gallons of young plasma, hundreds of donations\u2019 worth. But he faced a hitch: Blood banks don\u2019t typically separate out blood plasma by age and sell it for rejuvenation purposes; their primary mission is to provide donated blood for hospital patients and save lives.\n\nWhen blood centers have unused plasma, they commonly provide it to different companies in order to make products to treat serious medical conditions such as hemophilia, according to a spokesperson for AABB, a nonprofit that accredits blood centers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to find a blood bank willing to supply a startup for Karmazin\u2019s purposes. In the beginning, Karmazin called some 20 blood banks, he said. It \u201ctook a while to find the right partner,\u201d he added. There was interest, he claimed, but banks didn\u2019t have a process in place to get him the plasma he needed. HuffPost contacted more than a dozen U.S. blood banks, many of which cited ethical concerns and raised questions about Ambrosia\u2019s study. The chief medical and scientific officer of Vitalant, a nonprofit that distributes blood to more than 1,000 U.S. hospitals, told HuffPost that Vitalant leadership contacted all its donation centers after hearing about Ambrosia to confirm none worked with the company. Ambrosia\u2019s study didn\u2019t seem to be a legitimate clinical trial, Dr. Ralph Vassallo said, so Vitalant shouldn\u2019t be selling to the startup.\n\nEventually, Karmazin said, he found two blood banks to provide the company with \u201cexcess\u201d young plasma that he could use for his study. Karmazin refused to say which ones they were.\n\nEmmanuel Polanco for HuffPost\n\nDeep In The Heart Of Texas\n\nOne of his partners for Ambrosia\u2019s trial was the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a subsidiary of BioBridge Global, a nonprofit headquartered in San Antonio.\n\nSTBTC has lamented \u201ccritical\u201d blood supply shortages and called on millennials to \u201cstep up and donate.\u201d It has sent blood collection buses to schools and asks students on its website: \u201cAre you up for saving lives?\u201d It holds a donation competition for local high schools called \u201cGeneration Give\u201d with $750 top prizes, and has offered incentives to donors such as free movie tickets and amusement park passes. Students who have donated six blood products or more \u201chave made the difference in the lives of over 18 hospital patients,\u201d STBTC states on its website. Honored students receive a special red cord to wear at their high school graduation ceremony.\n\nThe South Texas blood bank\u2019s main mission is to provide blood to approximately 100 hospitals and clinics, Elizabeth Waltman, STBTC\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. But \u201cafter community needs are met, and to ensure no donated blood is wasted, we provide blood where it is needed, including to support research that will advance medical care,\u201d she added. Ambrosia\u2019s study met STBTC\u2019s requirements for research-related use of their blood components, she said.\n\nSTBTC did not comment on whether it sold donations that came through Generation Give as young plasma. But its consent forms for blood donors \u201cclearly state\u201d that donations will be used to serve \u201cboth clinical and research purposes,\u201d Waltman said. HuffPost reviewed a copy of STBTC\u2019s 1,200-word student consent form, which requires kids and parents to acknowledge that donated blood may be used to help patients \u201cor for any other medical purpose.\u201d The form praises students for \u201cgiving the gift of life.\u201d\n\nThe Trial\n\nBy the fall of 2016, Karmazin was ready to launch his study.\n\nAmbrosia told trial participants that \u201cabundant data\u201d from mice studies suggested young plasma infusions could help with \u201crejuvenation,\u201d but the company said it couldn\u2019t guarantee participants any specific results, such as the treatment of a disease. Rather, it noted in its informed consent form that there are \u201cno known improvements\u201d directly related to young plasma infusions. In fact, the form contained \u201can appalling lack of detailed explanation of what the actual effects of this intervention are supposed to be,\u201d said Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who reviewed Ambrosia\u2019s form at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\nKarmazin contracted physicians to carry out the young plasma transfusions at clinics in San Francisco; Monterey, California; and Tampa, Florida. The Monterey-based doctor, David Wright, had been publicly reprimanded by the Medical Board of California in 2015 for charges that included gross negligence related to diagnosing a patient with a chronic tick-borne infection without an adequate basis, and then using a medically unsupported treatment \u2015 daily antibiotic infusion therapy \u2015 that led to significant side effects. Wright did not admit to wrongdoing in the agreement; the reprimand did not preclude him from practicing medicine.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said one director of transfusion medicine. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm.\u201d\n\nThen-New Scientist writer Sally Adee traveled to Monterey to cover Ambrosia\u2019s trial in 2017 and reported that a patient who came from Russia had an anaphylactic reaction after a transfusion. Wright was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d after the incident, Adee wrote.\n\nAmbrosia ultimately reported four adverse incidents during the trial, according to Barbara Krutchkoff, the executive director of the Institute of Regenerative and Cellular Medicine, a small nonprofit that houses an institutional review board that oversaw the study. They included a rash in March 2017, a runny nose and cold symptoms in April, hives and edema in June, and itchiness in December. All were considered mild allergic reactions and resolved, she said.\n\nAmbrosia was fortunate there weren\u2019t more adverse reactions, said Le, the physician and global health specialist.\n\n\u201cIn general, somebody who does not need a blood transfusion would be at great risk for all sorts of things, short term and long term,\u201d said Le, who was alarmed that Ambrosia claimed to give patients about 2 liters of plasma over just one to two days.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said Robertson Davenport, director of transfusion medicine at the University of Michigan. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the study, Karmazin and Wright had a falling-out. They disagreed over Karmazin\u2019s plans to transfuse smaller amounts of young plasma over a shorter period of time \u2014 a change Wright deemed risky, according to the New Scientist article. \u201cWe just had different ideas for what this treatment could become,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. Wright stopped working for Ambrosia before the study was complete.\n\nWright did not respond to several calls and emailed requests for comment. When HuffPost sent a reporter to his new office in Pacific Grove, his receptionist threatened to call the police.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s Still No Data\u2019\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial formally ended in January 2018. It was a great success, according to Karmazin, with about one-third of the participants returning to purchase additional treatments and around 150 treatments delivered in all. Some people continued to receive transfusions as late as this past summer, he said.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Ambrosia had been touting findings for months. Karmazin claimed to Canada\u2019s National Post, for example, that an early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patient showed improvements with one treatment and a person in their 60s saw their graying hair turn darker. He told New Scientist that he saw a 10 percent decrease in patients\u2019 blood cholesterol levels, and told Boss Magazine there were \u201creally dramatic improvements\u201d to biomarkers for inflammation.\n\n[Ambrosia] seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money. Michael Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nThe company said it tested patients\u2019 blood for more than 100 biomarkers before and after the transfusions, looking for improvements in markers for aging and disease. Ambrosia\u2019s study did not have a control group that received a placebo. And a change in a biomarker isn\u2019t necessarily proof of a change in actual health status, noted Charo, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor. Such changes must be matched to \u201creal health outcomes,\u201d which requires long-term follow-up. Karmazin said patients wrote diaries, and that some later volunteered additional health data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how Ambrosia\u2019s was set up as a clinical trial,\u201d said Michael Conboy, husband and research partner of Irina Conboy, the aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley. \u201cIt seemed to me that it was set up as more of a \u2018fee for service\u2019 type thing and the \u2018trial\u2019 part was slapped on to legitimize it. It seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still no public data. Karmazin shared some \u201cpreliminary results that he was excited about\u201d with his hired institutional review board, Krutchkoff said, but she hadn\u2019t seen the final results. Speaking to HuffPost with Karmazin\u2019s permission, Krutchkoff praised Karmazin\u2019s professionalism and brushed off criticisms of the study. \u201cAs controversial as this study was, there\u2019s a lot worse being done,\u201d she said.\n\nHoward Chipman, the doctor Ambrosia hired in Tampa, also said he hadn\u2019t seen the results. HuffPost could not find a participant who had.\n\nTom Casey, the CEO of NuPlasma, a company that sells young plasma to physicians in Texas \u2015 and is supplying another young plasma study in Houston \u2014 urged Karmazin to release the data. \u201cThe people who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you called this a trial and said you were collecting data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still no data.\u201d\n\nResults Not Guaranteed\n\nKarmazin and David Cavalier, Ambrosia\u2019s then-president and chief operating officer, said earlier this past fall that they had to be careful not to make any guarantees about the effects of Ambrosia\u2019s treatment. Companies generally need to get approval from the FDA before they can claim that a drug or medical product treats, cures or prevents a disease. Cavalier noted that Ambrosia transfused a Parkinson\u2019s patient who reported an improvement in a tremor, a patient with depleted testosterone levels who was soon \u201cenjoying morning erections again,\u201d and people who reported improvements with arthritis symptoms, sleep, memory and energy levels.\n\nSome of Ambrosia\u2019s claims to the media have been \u201cmaybe a little bit exuberant\u201d but still \u201c100 percent accurate,\u201d Karmazin said.\n\nKarmazin told HuffPost in the fall he temporarily paused transfusions to focus on opening a clinic in New York City by early 2019. Ambrosia is required to obtain a permit to transfuse a blood component in New York, but as of mid-December, the company had not applied for one, according to a New York State Department of Health spokesperson.\n\nHe initially claimed he planned to publish the findings of Ambrosia\u2019s study in a peer-reviewed journal after its clinic was open. He announced this week on his website that Ambrosia is scheduling clients again in San Francisco and Tampa. He brought back two doctors he worked with during the study, he told HuffPost. He said this week that he still hadn\u2019t submitted any data for peer review \u2014 a process that can take months. He was \u201ceager to do so,\u201d but didn\u2019t know precisely when he would.\n\nCavalier quietly left the company this week, right before Ambrosia announced it was offering treatments again. He would not comment on the circumstances of his exit, but noted in an email that he was only with the company for \u201ca very brief period.\u201d Karmazin declined to comment further on Cavalier\u2019s departure.\n\nAnd at least one of Ambrosia\u2019s blood bank partners no longer sells young plasma. Shortly after HuffPost reached out to the South Texas blood bank in October, it abruptly halted all sales of young plasma products, according to an employee email chain HuffPost obtained.\n\n\u201cWe have had a few developments internally due to some negative press,\u201d an employee wrote on Oct. 22. Waltman, the STBTC executive, told HuffPost the bank would not supply Ambrosia with plasma for a clinic rollout because doing so would interfere with their ability to fulfill local needs. The HuffPost inquiry had no bearing on that issue, she added.\n\nFor all its press coverage, Ambrosia did not have any investors as of April 2017, Karmazin said; in September 2018, Karmazin told HuffPost that Ambrosia hadn\u2019t yet raised any money. That same month, he advertised on his LinkedIn page that the company was looking for $3 million to open its first clinic. By November, Karmazin said the LinkedIn posts had been removed because the company had garnered a \u201clarge amount of interest,\u201d but Ambrosia would not comment on whether it had any investors.\n\nDespite Karmazin\u2019s insistence that many people are excited about the treatment, over the course of reporting this story, Ambrosia declined to put HuffPost in touch with a single patient. Initially, Karmazin said the patients are protective of their privacy and \u201cafter the hundredth reporter asked to talk, people were just getting a little tired of answering the same questions.\u201d After HuffPost noted that it could find only one trial participant who had spoken to the press, Karmazin said that in the beginning, he had asked about 10 to 15 patients if they wanted to speak to reporters, but they all declined.\n\nIt appears the only participant in Ambrosia\u2019s trial who spoke to the press was a man from Georgia. He told a German newspaper that he was one of Ambrosia\u2019s first patients and had perhaps received \u201cmore blood plasma than anyone else in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia man was \u201cthe most excited person about this treatment,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. He died after going into cardiac arrest in February 2018 at the age of 65.\n\nYoung plasma \u201cisn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d the man told New Scientist last year. But he had hoped he could \u201cjust get 10 more healthy years of living.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s family did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the circumstances of his death, and a doctor familiar with his case declined to comment without a family member\u2019s permission. Karmazin said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment. It is unclear when the man received his final treatment with Ambrosia.\n\nThese days, Karmazin won\u2019t even publicly admit whether he has tried the treatment Ambrosia is hawking. He told one news outlet in June 2017 he hadn\u2019t, claiming he was waiting until he\u2019d be \u201cold enough\u201d at 35. In a separate interview in December 2017, when he was still not yet 35, he said he\u2019d tried it \u201ca few times\u201d and it felt \u201cpretty phenomenal.\u201d Speaking to HuffPost, he refused to comment, citing privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to confirm that I\u2019ve done it for the purposes of this interview,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, spending $8,000 on a young plasma transfusion is a \u201creally good use of people\u2019s health care dollars,\u201d Karmazin said. Those with certain diseases \u201cshould be getting treatment right away,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to be treating as many people as possible.\u201d\n\nThis week, Karmazin announced Ambrosia has lowered its age limit and raised its prices. People as young as 30 are now eligible for treatment. And two liters of young plasma costs $12,000.\n\nGot tips?

The mercury rule costs the coal industry $9.6 billion a year \u2015 making it one of the most expensive regulations ever issued by the EPA.\n\nBut the proposal reverses a decades-old finding \u2015 reaffirmed twice by the EPA \u2015 that the agency was within its legal grounds to control emissions of power-plant mercury and other dangerous pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses, neurological damage and cancer.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed now is the administration\u2019s attitude towards public health, and towards the coal industry\u201d Ann Weeks, legal director of the nonpartisan Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement. \u201cEPA proposes to disregard many of the important public benefits that result from controlling all the toxic air emissions from this industry.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the EPA\u2019s own analysis determined that the rule would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths, 130,000 asthma attacks and 5,700 hospital visits every year, and save taxpayers $90 billion in health care costs annually.\n\n\u201cChildren are especially vulnerable to environmental changes as they are smaller in size, breathe faster than adults, and experience rapid and critical periods of growth and development,\u201d Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the EPA to maintain these critical standards, and call on Congress to protect the MATS rule so that all children, regardless of their ZIP code, can breathe clean air.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Through a haze of tear gas and black smoke, she tries to reach a man sprawled on the ground along the Gaza border. Israeli soldiers, their weapons leveled, watch warily from the other side.\n\nMinutes later, a rifle shot rips through the din, and the Israeli-Palestinian drama has its newest tragic figure.\n\nFor a few days in June, the world took notice of the death of 20-year-old Rouzan al-Najjar, killed while treating the wounded at protests against Israel\u2019s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Even as she was buried, she became a symbol of the conflict, with both sides staking out competing and mutually exclusive narratives.\n\nTo the Palestinians, she was an innocent martyr killed in cold blood, an example of Israel\u2019s disregard for Palestinian life. To the Israelis, she was part of a violent protest aimed at destroying their country, to which lethal force is a legitimate response as a last resort.\n\nPalestinian witnesses embellished their initial accounts, saying she was shot while raising her hands in the air. The Israeli military tweeted a tendentiously edited video that made it sound like she was offering herself as a human shield for terrorists.\n\nIn each version, Ms. Najjar was little more than a cardboard cutout.\n\nAn investigation by The New York Times found that Ms. Najjar, and what happened on the evening of June 1, were far more complicated than either narrative allowed. Charismatic and committed, she defied the expectations of both sides. Her death was a poignant illustration of the cost of Israel\u2019s use of battlefield weapons to control the protests, a policy that has taken the lives of nearly 200 Palestinians.\n\nIt also shows how each side is locked into a seemingly unending and insolvable cycle of violence. The Palestinians trying to tear down the fence are risking their lives to make a point, knowing that the protests amount to little more than a public relations stunt for Hamas, the militant movement that rules Gaza. And Israel, the far stronger party, continues to focus on containment rather than finding a solution.\n\nIn life, Ms. Najjar was a natural leader whose uncommon bravery struck some peers as foolhardy. She was a capable young medic, but one who was largely self-taught and lied about her lack of education. She was a feminist, by Gaza standards, shattering traditional gender rules, but also a daughter who doted on her father, was particular about her appearance and was slowly assembling a trousseau. She inspired others with her outward jauntiness, while privately she was consumed with dread in her final days.\n\nThe bullet that killed her, The Times found, was fired by an Israeli sniper into a crowd that included white-coated medics in plain view. A detailed reconstruction, stitched together from hundreds of crowd-sourced videos and photographs, shows that neither the medics nor anyone around them posed any apparent threat of violence to Israeli personnel. Though Israel later admitted her killing was unintentional, the shooting appears to have been reckless at best, and possibly a war crime, for which no one has yet been punished."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "An Israeli Soldier Killed a Medic in Gaza.

He gave specific details: the minute each protester was shot, what they were wearing and that they were acting violently. We had uninterrupted footage extending over this period, and confirmed that four shots were fired at the times the commander said they were. We also identified the first, third and fourth targets. But we determined that the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 account of the second shot \u2014 fired at 6:31 p.m. \u2014 is inaccurate. Critically, this is the shot that killed Rouzan.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces\u2019 rules of engagement are secret, but Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, told us that its soldiers only target protesters who are posing a violent threat, like \u201ccutting the fence, throwing grenades.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military maintains that the 6:31 p.m. shot targeted and hit a protester wearing a yellow shirt who was throwing stones and pulling at the coils of barbed wire laid out 40 yards from the security fence. We identified several men and boys wearing yellow shirts that day. Only one was near the direction of fire. From several videos, we could determine that he was standing around 120 yards from the fence and that he did not appear to be protesting violently in the minutes leading up to the shot. Indeed, we didn\u2019t see any violent protesting in that area in the minutes before the fatal gunshot, suggesting that the shot contravened the Israeli military\u2019s own rules about targeting protesters. What\u2019s more, behind the target was a group of bystanders and medics in white coats. Former snipers in the United States Army and the Israel Defense Forces told us that, without a backstop, it was a reckless shot to take.\n\nThe bullet missed and hit the ground a few yards in front of the medics. Michael Knox, a forensic ballistics investigator, told us that the type of bullet used by the Israeli sniper could skim like a stone off the rocky soil.

Through a haze of tear gas and black smoke, she tries to reach a man sprawled on the ground along the Gaza border. Israeli soldiers, their weapons leveled, watch warily from the other side.\n\nMinutes later, a rifle shot rips through the din, and the Israeli-Palestinian drama has its newest tragic figure.\n\nFor a few days in June, the world took notice of the death of 20-year-old Rouzan al-Najjar, killed while treating the wounded at protests against Israel\u2019s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Even as she was buried, she became a symbol of the conflict, with both sides staking out competing and mutually exclusive narratives.\n\nTo the Palestinians, she was an innocent martyr killed in cold blood, an example of Israel\u2019s disregard for Palestinian life. To the Israelis, she was part of a violent protest aimed at destroying their country, to which lethal force is a legitimate response as a last resort.\n\nPalestinian witnesses embellished their initial accounts, saying she was shot while raising her hands in the air. The Israeli military tweeted a tendentiously edited video that made it sound like she was offering herself as a human shield for terrorists.\n\nIn each version, Ms. Najjar was little more than a cardboard cutout.\n\nAn investigation by The New York Times found that Ms. Najjar, and what happened on the evening of June 1, were far more complicated than either narrative allowed. Charismatic and committed, she defied the expectations of both sides. Her death was a poignant illustration of the cost of Israel\u2019s use of battlefield weapons to control the protests, a policy that has taken the lives of nearly 200 Palestinians.\n\nIt also shows how each side is locked into a seemingly unending and insolvable cycle of violence. The Palestinians trying to tear down the fence are risking their lives to make a point, knowing that the protests amount to little more than a public relations stunt for Hamas, the militant movement that rules Gaza. And Israel, the far stronger party, continues to focus on containment rather than finding a solution.\n\nIn life, Ms. Najjar was a natural leader whose uncommon bravery struck some peers as foolhardy. She was a capable young medic, but one who was largely self-taught and lied about her lack of education. She was a feminist, by Gaza standards, shattering traditional gender rules, but also a daughter who doted on her father, was particular about her appearance and was slowly assembling a trousseau. She inspired others with her outward jauntiness, while privately she was consumed with dread in her final days.\n\nThe bullet that killed her, The Times found, was fired by an Israeli sniper into a crowd that included white-coated medics in plain view. A detailed reconstruction, stitched together from hundreds of crowd-sourced videos and photographs, shows that neither the medics nor anyone around them posed any apparent threat of violence to Israeli personnel. Though Israel later admitted her killing was unintentional, the shooting appears to have been reckless at best, and possibly a war crime, for which no one has yet been punished."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "Bangladesh Elections: Choice of \u2018Lesser of Two Evils,\u2019 Voters Say", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/world/asia/bangladesh-elections.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "DHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladeshi voters will decide in parliamentary elections on Sunday whether to punish the governing party for worsening human rights conditions or reward it for overseeing a booming economy.\n\nDuring Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s two terms, the economy and social development have improved, according to most measures.

It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer considers it a possible human carcinogen, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the F.D.A. to ban it nearly 20 years ago. The F.D.A. says potassium bromate has been in use since before the Delaney amendment on carcinogenic food additives was passed.\n\nAzodicarbonamide, or ADA, which is used as a whitening agent in cereal flour and as a dough conditioner, breaks down during baking into chemicals that cause cancer in lab animals. It is used by many chain restaurants that serve sandwiches and buns. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has urged the F.D.A. to bar its use.

In a 2014 experiment, Christopher Barnes of the University of Washington and colleagues asked 142 people with extreme chronotypes to show up at their laboratory either at 7 a.m. or at midnight for a dice-rolling game that offered a $500 prize. Reporting was on the honor system. Morning people lied 18 percent more when they did the task at midnight than when they did it in the morning, whereas night owls lied 16 percent more when doing the task at 7 a.m.\n\nDr. Roenneberg has collected data from 300,000 people and found that chronotypes plot as a bell-shaped curve, with a few individuals at each extreme and most falling somewhere in the middle. According to Dr. Roenneberg\u2019s research, the most frequent chronotype \u2014 held by about 13 percent of the population \u2014 sleeps from around midnight to 8 a.m. Thirty-one percent of people have an earlier natural bedtime, and 56 percent have a later one. That means for at least 69 percent of the population, getting to the office by 8 or 9 a.m. requires waking up before their body is ready."}]
