Orrin Hatch of Utah lamented in his farewell speech delivered on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill , who was defeated in the November midterm elections, echoed that idea when she delivered her own farewell speech . \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was worried about this place,\" she said. \"It just doesn't work as well as it used to.\"\n\n\"Something is broken,\" the Missouri Democrat went on to say. \"If we don't have the strength to look in the mirror and fix it, the American people are going to grow more and more cynical.\"\n\nAs senators who were either ousted in the elections or decided to retire and not seek another term reflected on their time in Congress, many expressed dismay at how divided Washington has become as lawmakers retreat to entrenched partisan positions that leave little room for compromise or common ground.\n\nMost of them spoke in the final weeks of the year, a time largely overshadowed by a flurry of last-minute legislative activity and an unsuccessful effort to stave off a partial government shutdown. But the shuttering of roughly 25% of the federal government appeared to help illustrate a common sentiment conveyed during many of these farewell speeches: that something would need to change for Washington to function properly.\n\n'This is not a normal time'\n\nMcCaskill and Hatch weren't the only ones sounding alarm bells.\n\n\"To say that our politics is not healthy is somewhat of an understatement,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake said in his farewell speech . \"I believe that we all know well that this is not a normal time and that the threats to our democracy from within and without are real.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump , went beyond a critique of American politics to say he believes an \"authoritarian impulse\" is experiencing a resurgence worldwide and that the \"global commitment to democracy seems now to be on somewhat shaky ground.\"\n\nBut while departing senators had unique messages to impart, the overarching idea that there's a problem with the current state of politics was a consistent theme.\n\n\"What in the world has happened to civility and to humility in our nation's public discourse?\" Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who lost his seat in the midterms, asked in his farewell speech.\n\n\"Tribalism is our problem, and if not corrected, it's going to take our country down,\" he warned.\n\nYear marked by 'loss of comity'\n\nThe farewell speeches came as the most recent session of Congress drew to a close in late December -- a session that has been punctuated by a series of bitterly contentious fights on Capitol Hill.\n\nTensions ran high between Democratic and Republican senators during the confirmation hearings. In one dramatic moment, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina accused his Democratic colleagues of trying to \"destroy\" Kavanaugh's life for political gain.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters 00:42\n\nIn the end, only one Republican -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- opposed the nomination, while just one Democrat -- Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- sided with Senate Republicans to elevate Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nHatch said during his farewell speech that \"many factors contribute to the current dysfunction,\" but added, \"If I were to identify the root of the crisis it would be this: the loss of comity and genuine good feeling among Senate colleagues.\"\n\nIn yet another sign of division between the two parties, 2018 started off with a government shutdown at the end of January and ended with another fight in December, when a standoff between Trump and Democrats over funding for a border wall triggered a partial shutdown that began just days before Christmas\n\nDon't be afraid of 'tough votes' and other advice\n\nAs departing senators outlined concerns in their farewell speeches, many described what they believe has contributed to the highly divisive political climate and what they think needs to change.\n\nMcCaskill urged lawmakers to have the courage to take \"tough votes.\"\n\n\"Solving the toughest problems will not happen without tough votes,\" she said. \"We can talk about the toughest problems ... we can argue about them, we can campaign on them, but we're not going to solve them without tough votes.\"\n\nNelson and outgoing Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who also lost his seat in the midterms, suggested that an influx of big money in politics has had a corrosive effect, making an argument common to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The court's 2010 decision opened the floodgates and allowed the wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections and corrupt our democracy,\" Nelson said, referring to the landmark 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn his farewell speech, Donnelly said that \"the divisive rhetoric, the political campaigns, increasingly funded by tens of millions of dollars, anonymous, dark money interests is really doing damage to this country.\"\n\nNelson argued that another issue is the \"constant attempts to disenfranchise voters and make it more difficult for every American to have their voice heard at the ballot box.\"\n\nHatch, meanwhile, decried \"identity politics,\" a concept often invoked critically by Republicans, who frequently accuse Democrats of subscribing to it.\n\n\"We must reject the politics of division, starting with identity politics,\" the Utah Republican said, adding that \"identity politics is nothing more than dressed-up tribalism. It is the deliberate and often unnatural segregation of people into categories for political gain.\"\n\n'I love this place'\n\nIn their farewell speeches, departing senators also reflected on fond memories of their time in Congress, and some expressed optimism for the future despite their concerns.\n\n\"For all the problems I've outlined, know that I love this place,\" McCaskill said. \"We have fought, we have cried and we have laughed together. Just like family.\"\n\n\"For more than four decades, I have had the distinct privilege of serving in the United States Senate,\" Hatch said , adding, \"speaking on the Senate floor, debating legislation in committee, corralling the support of our colleagues on compromise legislation -- these are the moments I will miss. These are the memories I will cherish forever.\"\n\nHatch went on to say that \"to address this body is to experience a singular feeling: a sense that you are a part of something bigger than yourself, a minor character in the grand narrative that is America.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See Flake's goodbye speech on Senate floor Replay More Videos ...

Claire McCaskill has some advice for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming freshman who has rapidly risen from obscurity to one of the most well-known figures in the Democratic Party: Talk is cheap.\n\nMcCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who's in her final days in office after losing her bid for a third Senate term, told CNN in a wide-ranging interview that her party must begin to focus and deliver on real issues to attract independent and white working class voters -- not pie-in-the-sky policy ideas, such as tuition-free college, that have little chance of becoming law. Her concern: Voters grow cynical after hearing campaign promises that never go anywhere, empowering forces like President Donald Trump to rail against Washington for failed promises, as he did in 2016.\n\nDemocrats, she suggested, should be cautious about the rise of politicians like the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez, who vanquished a Democratic leader, Joe Crowley, in her primary, and have vowed sweeping changes in policy.\n\n\"I don't know her,\" McCaskill said when asked if she'd consider Ocasio-Cortez a \"crazy Democrat\" like the ones she decried on the campaign trail. \"I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good example of what I'm talking about, a bright shiny new object, came out of nowhere and surprised people when she beat a very experienced congressman.\"\n\nMcCaskill added, \"And so she's now talked about a lot. I'm not sure what she's done yet to generate that kind of enthusiasm, but I wish her well. I hope she hangs the moon.\n\n\"But I hope she also realizes that the parts of the country that are rejecting the Democratic Party, like a whole lot of white working class voters, need to hear about how their work is going to be respected, and the dignity of their jobs, and how we can really stick to issues that we can actually accomplish something on.\"\n\nAnd she concluded: \"The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.\"\n\nIn the interview, the blunt-speaking Missouri Democrat, reflecting on her election loss to Republican Josh Hawley -- a political novice whom she also referred to as a \"bright shining object\" -- also didn't mince words for the Republican Party.\n\nWhile she warned that history \"will judge some of my colleagues harshly that they didn't stand up to this President at some of the moments where he has been unhinged about particularly the rule of law,\" she also said that GOP senators have privately conceded they can't speak out against Trump because of backlash they'd receive from their base.\n\n\"Now they'll tell you, if it's just the two of you, 'The guy is nuts, he doesn't have a grasp of the issues, he's making rash decisions, he's not listening to people who know the subject matter,' \" she said. \"But in public if they go after him ... they know they get a primary, and they know that's tough.\"\n\nShe declined to single out individual Republicans, but when asked about Sen. Lindsey Graham and the South Carolina Republican's alliance with Trump, she said: \"It's kind of weird to me, I don't know what happened with Lindsey.\"\n\n\"This is Donald Trump's Republican Party,\" McCaskill said. \"Make no mistake about it.\"\n\nAs she sat back in her chair in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing room, where she served as the ranking Democrat, she said of Trump, \"I mean, he's almost the master of, 'I'm going to do so much stuff that's crazy that nobody notices crazy anymore.' \"\n\nOne instance, she cited, in particular was when the rapper Kanye West spouted off on a wild, profanity-laced tirade in the Oval Office -- all in front of the television cameras.\n\n\"I mean, Kanye West was in the Oval Office M-F---ing on live TV,\" McCaskill said, seemingly perplexed. \"I mean, think about that. That is crazy weird. Can you imagine would have happened if that happened during the Obama years? ... The lid would have blown off this place.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think Fox News Channel would have gone up in some kind of spontaneous combustion, had that happened (during the Obama years). But it happens under Trump and it's like, well, just another day at the office. So there is a numbing that's gone on, that some of the craziest stuff that he says and does is not as noticeable because there's so much of it.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Trump's brash style and popularity with conservative voters helped turn the tide against McCaskill. He held multiple campaign events for Hawley, railing on McCaskill and castigating her as a far-left liberal out of step with more mainstream voters.\n\n\"He camped out so often in Missouri the last 30 days I figured he was building a golf course,\" McCaskill said.\n\nIn 2006, she eked out a victory against then-Sen. Jim Talent, helping Democrats take control of the Senate -- and in 2012 when then-President Barack Obama lost her state by 10 points, she pulled off a victory due in large part to the controversies of her Republican opponent, Todd Akin, whose campaign imploded when he downplayed pregnancies caused by rape.\n\nThis time, she faced a 38-year-old, telegenic Republican with little political experience -- something Hawley used to his advantage against the 65-year-old McCaskill, who has nearly four decades in politics.\n\n\"In most professions and careers, the more experience you have, the better, the more valuable you are to the people that you work for. In politics, not so much anymore,\" McCaskill said. \"There was a sense that, maybe she has been around long enough.\"\n\nWhat turned the tide, in McCaskill's view, was the raging fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Trump's 11th-hour rhetoric against migrant caravans approaching the southern border only added to that, and said it amounted to \"whipped cream and the cherry on top of the ice cream\" to drive up GOP turnout.\n\nBut she contended that it was the fight over Kavanaugh, whom she voted against, that ultimately did her in.\n\nAsked if she believed she would have won re-election had there not been a Supreme Court vacancy, she said: \"I think it would have been much more likely.\"\n\nAs one of the country's most vulnerable Senate Democrats, McCaskill had been the subject of a furious onslaught by GOP outside groups -- namely a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about her views on McConnell, she said she believes that \"every decision\" the GOP leader makes is based on whether it helps Republican senators.\n\n\"He is a very, very political leader,\" McCaskill said of McConnell. \"This isn't somebody who is sitting around at night figuring out how he can move the needle on really important policy issues. This is someone who is figuring out how he can win elections and beat Democrats like me.\"\n\nAs her Senate term now comes to an end, McCaskill vowed \"never\" to become a lobbyist but said she will now use her style of \"mouthing off\" in her next line of work. She said she's not waiting to use her mouth now to give advice to her party as candidates line up to take on Trump in 2020.\n\n\"Donald Trump got elected partially because there was such cynicism that we can't get anything done here. And the way you get things done here is by reasonable negotiation and compromise,\" McCaskill said of the 2020 race. \"Somebody who talks about leading in that direction is the one that can win places like Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and maybe even compete in a place like Missouri.\"\n\nAsked if her colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is weighing a White House run, could win in those states, McCaskill said, \"I don't know. I think it's hard.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "See how Trump's false claims have multiplied", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/clp0pouQblU/victor-blackwell-gumball-trump-false-claims-newday-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The opinions in this article belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Details of what happened October 2 were being drip-fed by Turkish officials with the narrative skill of TV scriptwriters hooking a global audience into an addictive box set.\n\nThe popular journalist and affable raconteur Jamal Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nHe'd been suffocated. His body had disappeared. He was allegedly chopped into pieces with a bone saw brought on a private plane.\n\nThere were various suggestions that his remains had been dissolved into acid, stuffed down a well or wrapped in a blanket and taken away by a local \"collaborator.\"\n\nAs the saga unfolded, the US Senate voted to accuse Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of being behind the killing.\n\nBut there's a subplot that might give this body bag of a story a silver lining.\n\nSaudi Arabia admitted, eventually, that The Washington Post columnist had indeed been killed, but that this was not sanctioned by the royal court. Rather, it was a unilateral decision taken on the ground by the head of a team that was supposed, at worst, to abduct Khashoggi and drag him back to the kingdom.\n\nWhatever the Saudis claim, the abiding result of the Khashoggi tragedy has been to paint Saudi Arabia as a vicious, uncivilized land run by a despotic family. Not as the forward-thinking nation and leading light of the modern Islamic world that its crown prince would like to project.\n\nOne Saudi critic of the royal court replied to a text I sent him from Riyadh in the first fortnight of covering the story in which I asked, \"Whodunnit?\"\n\n\"Don Corleone.\"\n\nBy referring to the fictitious mafia leader in \"The Godfather,\" the man was perhaps risking his life. Most other contacts in Riyadh to whom I spoke were circumspect to say the least -- sticking firmly to whatever the prevailing narrative was being spun out of the royal court.\n\nSo I deleted his text, removed his number from my contacts' list both in my phone and on the cloud -- and destroyed any notes that could have led an investigator to him.\n\nNot since the 1980 docudrama \"Death of a Princess,\" which alleged that Princess Mishaal bint Fahd al Saud was executed on the orders of her grandfather, and her alleged lover beheaded, has Saudi Arabia suffered such reputational damage.\n\nJUST WATCHED Time magazine names 2018 Person of the Year Replay More Videos ...

Indeed, it's a stalwart of the West's fight against violent political Islam, part of the US-led coalition standing against Iran's regional meddling, and the world's second-biggest producer of crude oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a vital economic partner, a major consumer of American weapons and an intimate friend when it comes to regional intelligence sharing.\n\nIt's also involved in a war in Yemen, which has killed an estimated 85,000 children , according to Save the Children. Another 14 million are at risk of starvation -- among them 400,000 children who are, the United Nations says, on the brink of hunger.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which supports the internationally recognized government of Yemen in its fight against the Iranian-backed Houthis, shows no signs of being able to win the war or stave off the humanitarian disaster.\n\nSo it's agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nSaudi Arabia cannot afford to be seen, or accused, of causing a famine on its doorstep.\n\nReeling from the fallout of the Khashoggi case, which it can do little about given the presumption of guilt that's attached itself to the kingdom's most powerful figure, Saudi Arabia needs to do and be seen to be doing \"the right thing.\"\n\nThat means backing away from war into peace in Yemen.\n\nIt's an unintended but welcome potential ending to the Khashoggi saga's subplot."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Inside the Japanese town that pays cash for kids", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/PlIpHlXoJPo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "The series on Japan's demographic reckoning is funded by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. None of the material in this series may be reproduced without an explicit credit to CNN and the Pulitzer Center.\n\nNagi, Japan (CNN) When Katsunori and Kaori Osaka had their first child, they were living in a cramped apartment in Nagoya, a city of more than 2 million people in central Japan.\n\nLike many other young couples, they tried to raise their child in the city but found life among the apartment blocks too crowded and expensive, with few child care options. Eventually, they gave up.\n\n\"When people are in their 20s and 30s, they can't really afford to live in a bigger space in a city,\" Katsunori said. \"We knew that if we wanted to have more kids, we couldn't do it there.\"\n\nCocooned amid hills, the little town of Nagi-cho is also home to a Japan Self Defense Forces garrison and the Nagi Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nFourteen years later, the Osakas moved to Nagi, where Katsunori grew up. The sleepy agricultural town in western Japan has become a success story in the country's efforts to boost its declining birth rate.\n\nWith a population of about 6,000, Nagi feels a world away from Nagoya, and residents cite the lack of busy streets and crowds as reasons why it is a great place to bring up children.\n\nBut they're not the only benefits: Nagi also pays couples who live there to have children.\n\nFamilies receive a one-time 100,000 yen ($879) payment for their first child, 150,000 yen ($1,335) for their second and as much as 400,000 yen ($3,518) for the fifth child born to the same family.\n\nNagi has been ramping up payments since 2004, as well as offering other fertility-boosting parental perks, to turbocharge the town's birth rate and buck Japan's broader trend of aging populations.\n\nPerks include subsidized housing, free vaccinations, school allowances and reduced nursery costs.\n\nAnd they appear to be working.\n\nIn the neighborhood where the Osakas live, most couples have three or more children because they can and they want to.\n\nThis leaves Nagi in stark contrast to much of Japan.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, the town's fertility rate -- based on the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime -- doubled from 1.4 to 2.8, to widespread domestic acclaim.\n\nSince then, Nagi's total fertility rate has dipped slightly to 2.39 but is still considerably higher than the national average of 1.46.\n\nThe Osakas say they'd like their children to experience the world first, instead of settling down immediately in Nagi-cho.\n\nShrinking Japan\n\nJapan has been on a steady demographic decline since the 1970s.\n\n1.3 million, In 2017, fewer than 950,000 babies were born while the number of deaths rose to a postwar high of1.3 million, according to the Ministry of Health and Labor.\n\nand children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. Japan's population is expected to drop to about The country's total population stands at 127 million,and children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. And by 2065 Japan's population is expected to drop to about 88 million\n\nMore than 5,400 children are seeking an elusive spot at day care centers in the city, nearly 30% of the national total.\n\nTraditionally, government policies had made it difficult for working men and women to balance their careers with family life, said Hirokazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nAs well as a lack of child care, the country's declining fertility rate is influenced by career demands and the increasing trend among men and women to delay or avoid marriage . The numbers of people still unmarried by age 50 hit a record 23.37% for men and 14.06% for women in 2015, according to a report released by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.\n\nBut Kato said another key factor is the steady migration of people from the countryside to expensive smaller apartments in crowded cities.\n\nMore than 93% of Japan's population lives in urban areas , where having one or more children is just too hard for many couples.\n\n\"There's a huge gap between the cost of living in Japan's major cities and the less populated areas of the country,\" Kato added. Couples in the city are often also far from their families, who could otherwise help support them.\n\nIt's not uncommon for families to have three to five children in Nagi. Kids play games with their siblings at the local preschool. For now, there is no waiting list to get a spot at day care.\n\nIs the progress enough?\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has introduced policies to boost its birth rate, such as enhancing child care services and improving housing and public facilities for families with children.\n\nLast year resulted in some progress nationally: The number of children on waiting lists for daycare centers nationwide slipped below 20,000 for the first time in 10 years, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\nspending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at daycare centers. Furthermore, that year, the government announced a 2 trillion yen ($18 billion)spending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at daycare centers.\n\nAs in many places around the world, women in Japan were traditionally expected to leave work to care for their families. But such attitudes are slowly shifting.\n\n\"The traditional way of thinking, 'men at work and women at home', is a historical relic in Japan,\" said Yukiko Inoue-Smith, a professor of education psychology at the University of Guam. \"Women in Japan want to keep their jobs, and their husbands want them to work so they can have a double income.\"\n\nGovernment efforts to keep women in the workforce through a plan called womenomics are also paying off.\n\nIn just three decades, the percentage of Japanese women age 30 to 34 who return to the labor force after becoming mothers has risen from 50% to 75%, according to recent reports.\n\nBut many of those who go back to work have to accept lower wages or get stuck on the career ladder, according to a report published in 2017 by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nFathers must also play a greater role in child care and the home so women can resume their careers, according to Inoue-Smith.\n\nThis presents its own difficulties. In Japan, new fathers can take up to one year of non-paid paternity leave -- one of the highest fathers leave periods in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, only 3% take this, as they fear the repercussions on their careers and income.\n\nA family-friendly future\n\nNestled amid leafy hills, Nagi is famous for its wagyu beef and boasts a small manufacturing center where 19 companies have factories. Life remains fairly traditional; most couples marry in their early to mid-20s and start families soon after.\n\nThe women who live in or move to the town know it doesn't offer high-flying careers but value the chance to balance work and home life.\n\nUp to 70% of women continue their day jobs, often as office workers or teachers, after childbirth. Lengthy commutes, grueling workloads and limited child care aren't a problem here. And for mothers who want to work a few hours a week, a local company offers casual jobs such as data inputting and packaging goods while their children are in daycare.\n\nNobue Sasaki stands in the hallway of the Nagi Child Home.\n\nThe town also spends a decent proportion of its budget on family services, partly due to extra funds it receives from the government for hosting a Japan Self-Defense Force garrison.\n\nIn the past, officials here have also accepted lower salaries so they can funnel more money into the town's future.\n\nSome large extended families still live under one roof, or at least within the same neighborhood, so grandparents can pitch in with the children while their parents work.\n\nNagi-cho strives to create a family-friendly setting for all age groups. Kozue Kobayashi relaxes with her child in the Nagi Child Home. An older volunteer watches over a busy mother's child.\n\n\"We've really focused on creating a family-friendly environment in Nagi,\" Nobue Sasaki, a soft-spoken town official, said inside the pastel-tinted walls of the Nagi Child Home, a center dedicated to supporting mothers and people across the age spectrum.\n\nKozue Kobayashi, a mother in her early 30s who moved from Okayama city to Nagi, said she appreciated the camaraderie of the Nagi Child Home, where she gets help looking after her children. She comes most days.\n\n\"It's better than just staying at home and feeling alone and overwhelmed,\" Kobayashi said. \"If I'd stayed in Okayama, I wouldn't have access to this kind of service.\"\n\nNagi undertook a large-scale public relations campaign in 2012 to publicize the success of its family planning initiatives -- and word has spread.\n\nWhen CNN visited, a group of smartly dressed senior bureaucrats milled around the entrance to the center's playroom. They were just some of the many people who had come to learn the town's fertility secrets.\n\n\"Our population has remained stable, but we can take some lessons away from a space like this,\" said Nagatoshi Ishiura, a bespectacled local politician from the neighboring town of Shouji. \"It's nice to see a place where there's still exchange between three different generations.\"\n\nThe Osakas' daughter prepares to play against her brother. The Osakas don't necessarily want their kids to stay in Nagi after they've grown up.\n\nAs well as parent-friendly policies, changing attitudes in Japanese society have helped create the right environment for having children in Nagi. Traditional expectations that women give up work after childbirth are breaking down. Choosing to be a stay-at-home mom is gradually becoming a personal choice rather than a societal obligation, said Inoue-Smith, the education psychology professor.\n\nKaori chose parenthood over her career but said she wouldn't necessarily want that for her own children.\n\n\"I'm not expecting my own daughters to stay in Nagi,\" she said. \"I'd prefer it if they left Nagi and saw more of the world.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A frugal social worker left $11 million to kids' charities", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/xdXDJsyVqbg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Alan Naiman was known for his frugality -- he wore Costco jeans, bought his favorite pocket T-shirts at a grocery store and squirreled away every penny he could.

He told the group in a letter that the center had been there for him when he needed to find a place for sick babies that were brought to him.\n\n\"We are so grateful to Alan, not only for his legacy, but also for the life he devoted to children,\" the group wrote.\n\nKaran said donations mostly to children's charities including Make-A-Wish, Father Flanagan's Boys Town and Treehouse, a non-profit that helps kids in foster care. He also gave money to his parents' Catholic church and Disabled American Veterans.\n\nNaiman was excited to think about how much good his money would do when the time came, Karan said.\n\n\"'My gift is going to be bigger than their annual budget.

But whether he'll actually be sworn in as a member of Congress next week remains up in the air, as he would need a court to quickly rule that he is entitled to the seat -- because the state board did not certify the result, there is no legal authority outside of a court order to allow him to take his seat.\n\nAnd House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is set to take on the position of majority leader in the next Congress, said Democrats will work to ensure Harris is not seated.\n\n\"Given the now well-documented election fraud that took place in NC-09, Democrats would object to any attempt by Mr. Harris to be seated on January 3,\" Hoyer said in a statement. \"In this instance, the integrity of our democratic process outweighs concerns about the seat being vacant at the start of the new Congress.\"\n\nHoyer later told CNN's Jim Acosta on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\" \"My own view is, we probably ought to redo the general election.\"\n\nThe decision to disband the board represents a jarring reversal by state Republicans who earlier this month had all but endorsed the need for new elections amid mounting evidence of election fraud on behalf of the Harris campaign and a report that early voter data had been leaked in Bladen County.\n\nThe filing came a day after a three-judge state court panel denied a stay to keep the state elections board, which is investigating the allegations, in its current form and ordered the board to dissolve at noon Friday.\n\nThe board had refused to certify Harris as November's winner amid evidence of irregularities in the absentee ballot count and reports of a fraud scheme directed by a Republican operative hired by Harris' campaign.\n\nHarris leads in the unofficial tally of the 2018 election by 905 votes over Democratic candidate Dan McCready.\n\nIn a statement, McCready ripped Harris and his campaign.\n\n\"Over the past month, it has become abundantly clear that North Carolinians had their voices silenced during the election in North Carolina's Ninth District,\" McCready said in a statement. \"Mark Harris and his allies promised to support a complete investigation into this attack on our democracy. He has now broken this promise and is instead doing all he can to obstruct this bipartisan investigation into the illegal election activities within his own campaign.\n\n\"All North Carolinians -- regardless of party -- deserve a swift and complete investigation without panicked obstruction from Mark Harris. Now more than ever we deserve to know what Mark Harris knew and when he knew it.\"\n\nIn its petition, the Harris campaign wrote to the board that it, \"is not aware of irregularities or other concerns sufficient in number to change the outcome of the election in the 9th district.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, before filing the petition, Harris told WBT radio in Charlotte he is willing to take the fight to court if the board doesn't certify the results of the election.\n\nThough the board has dissolved, board staffers can continue to work on the investigation, but they will not be able to issue subpoenas, hold hearings or call for a new election, said Josh Lawson, the board's general counsel.\n\n\"As you know, your client (Harris) is under a subpoena dated December 1, but has made only one production on December 7 totaling 398 pages,\" the board's former chair Joshua Malcolm wrote in its response to the Harris campaign's petition. \"Yet your client through counsel indicated that you possess roughly 140,000 additional documents that may be responsive but have not yet been produced. We have received repeated assurances\u2014as recently as December 24\u2014regarding your efforts to comply with the subpoena.\n\nHe added, \"You are hereby requested to fully comply with the Board's subpoena so as to not further impact the agency's ability to resolve the investigation.\"\n\nMalcolm also said board staffers have attempted to schedule an interview with Harris, whose team has indicated he is willing to sit down for an interview.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Party's executive director Dallas Woodhouse said Harris has been cooperating with the board's investigation.\n\n\"He's not required to send to a Democrat every piece of paper a campaign ever put forward,\" Woodhouse said Friday on CNN's \"Newsroom.\" \"By the way, it is irrelevant. The board of elections needed to establish that these things happened, that they happened at all. Mr. Harris only ever touched his ballot. His. He doesn't have anything to add. This was an absolutely atrocious smear by a disgraced democrat elections chair, the former chair now on the way out. It is unconscionable.\"\n\nWoodhouse told CNN that the three-judge panel recognized that the board of elections, led by Malcolm, \"was going to just continue a never-ending fishing expedition.\"\n\nHe predicted that the federal court would order the state of North Carolina to certify the November results.\n\nThe board had planned to hold an evidentiary hearing in the case on January 11, 2019.\n\nThe board's current structure had been struck down before the 2018 election, but the court had delayed implementing that order until now.\n\nIn their ruling Thursday, the judges said the board had not complied with previous court orders and that they had not provided enough information about why the hearing had been delayed.\n\nA new board to be appointed\n\nThere is also uncertainty over the makeup of the elections board. A new state law requires Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to appoint a new board, but not until January 31, 2019.\n\nIn a letter Friday to both state party chairs, Cooper said he will appoint a temporary five-member board under the old rules to preside until the end of January \"to hasten the investigatory work by the Board and maintain continuity.\"\n\nState Republicans have said Cooper does not have the authority to do so and plan to challenge that in court as well. The party has also said they will not accept appointments to the temporary board Cooper is trying to establish.\n\nThe state elections board had been expected to call for a new election in early 2019 if it was able to corroborate the evidence of irregularities in the 9th district race.\n\nState Democratic Party officials have called for a new election in the district, and Republicans largely conceded a few weeks ago that a second vote will likely be necessary. The state legislature overrode the governor's veto of a bill that requires any call for a new election to also provide for another primary, which would give Republicans a chance to replace Harris before a rematch with McCready.\n\nA Democratic strategist familiar with the situation accused the Republican Party of doing a complete turnaround in its position from letting the board continue its investigation to attempting to certify the election results Friday.\n\n\"The new position coming from the Woodhouse camp is surprising,\" the strategist said. \"They have a lot of explaining to do. They have produced no evidence to the state board of elections, their candidate has refused to comply with the subpoenas, given no evidence, and are they are trying to strong-arm the state board of elections into taking no further action.\"\n\nWayne Goodwin, the chair of the state Democratic Party, went further.\n\n\"Mark Harris is trying to steal this election. It is obstruction of an investigation,\" Goodwin said Friday in an interview on CNN's \"Newsroom.\"\n\nHe added later, \"Governor Cooper is trying to do his best within the law so we can have a board established and it will be established under the last constitutional law to get the job done. There is ample evidence provided publicly and I'm confident there is more evidence that the Republicans apparently don't want us to see. This is obstruction of an investigation.\"\n\nThe investigation\n\nOfficials are in the process of reviewing evidence of absentee ballot fraud allegedly orchestrated by Leslie McRae Dowless, whose efforts potentially helped Harris win Bladen County.\n\n\"To date, the State Board's investigative staff has conducted more than 100 interviews, and the staff is actively engaged in the review of more than 182,000 pages of materials produced in response to 12 subpoenas issued by the State Board,\" Joshua Malcolm, the Democratic chair of the board, said in an affidavit filed in court on December 21.\n\nHarris has denied any wrongdoing. In his interview with WBT radio, Harris defended his decision to hire Dowless, saying that the GOP operative was recommended to him by political leaders he trusted in the state.\n\nHarris claimed specifically that Dowless said he does not collect, or \"harvest,\" absentee ballots, which Dowless is accused of doing and is an illegal practice in North Carolina.\n\nHe also floated a conspiracy theory that the elections board, which is made up of both Republican and Democratic members, purposely held on to that information to prevent him from winning the election.\n\n\"Did they decide that they would sit on this and they would wait, and they would see and somehow if $11 million and Dan McCready couldn't beat Mark Harris, this would be an insurance policy that they would play to get a do-over?\" Harris asked. \"I would hate to think that we had an agency in our state government that would operate with that kind of sinister leadership, but I am telling you the facts are the facts, they sat on this and we could've known what was happening there, and I just think it is sad.\"\n\nThe state's Republican Party applauded the Harris' campaign's decision to file a petition in court.\n\n\"It is important to note that no serious evidence of some of the most concerning allegations including widespread destruction of ballots ever materialized,\" North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement Friday. \"There is simply no concrete evidence to show that even the mishandling of some absentee ballots amounted to a change of more than a thousand votes in this race.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open .

As a contract nurse, she has worked \"for just about every hospital within two hours of my home.\"\n\nToday, the policy \"in every facility that I am aware of\" is to \"waste\" unused medicines down the sink or toilet.\n\n\"If someone is ordered morphine 1 milligram every four hours and it comes supplied in 2-milligram vials, then I have to waste 1 milligram down the sink each time,\" she explained. \"It's ridiculous.\" Imagine all the nurses on all the shifts in all the hospitals across the country doing the same, she said.\n\n\"Every time I waste something, I think I'm destroying my water system,\" she said. \"I've got kids and grandkids. I hate to see us polluting their water like that.\"\n\n'Conflicting rules'\n\nA 2017 study titled \" Drugs down the drain: When nurses object \" begins with an observation: \"Many times during a typical workday, American hospital nurses routinely discard unused portions of narcotics and other controlled substances into municipal water supplies.\" The reason this practice is routine, the authors suggest, stems from inconsistencies in regulations and how they are interpreted by hospitals.\n\n\"There are agencies at the federal, state, and local levels that have issued conflicting rules\" about pharmaceutical disposal methods for hospitals, the authors wrote.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency strongly discourages pouring or flushing pharmaceuticals down the drain in any setting, including at health care facilities, because they may enter and pass through water treatment systems and contaminate the water supply. As part of its rule for managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the EPA has banned the \"sewering\" (or pouring down the drain or toilet) of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at health care facilities.\n\nHowever, this rule, which was only finalized this month, applies only to drugs considered hazardous waste , such as toxic chemotherapy drugs. Most pharmaceuticals do not fall into this category.\n\nIn contrast to the EPA's stance, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised individuals to sewer narcotics and controlled substances , including morphine and other opioids, in order to avoid harm to animals and humans , including children, who could gain access to these powerful and dangerous drugs.\n\n\"To date, scientists have found no evidence of harmful effects to human health from medicines in the environment,\" the FDA website says.\n\nThe FDA does not provide official guidance to hospitals. Still, the recommendation of this federal agency might carry weight with hospital administrators, who must also consider and follow the requirements of the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nRusty Payne, a spokesman for the DEA, explained that diversion is his agency's primary concern when it comes to how hospitals handle pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\"Many problems associated with drug abuse are the result of legitimately made controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into illicit drug traffic,\" the DEA website says. In plain English, doctors, nurses or other hospital staff sometimes steal pharmaceuticals labeled controlled substances by the DEA -- opioids, mostly -- in order to sell them for profit or use themselves.\n\n\"We document the sales, what comes in and out, in terms of controlled substances, not all drugs, just controlled substances,\" Payne said. For example, the DEA demands that painkillers such as morphine and other opioids be \"heavily documented in terms of how they're distributed and administered in a hospital.\"\n\nFor this reason, hospitals and hospital pharmacies have strict regulations that require nurses to document each use of a controlled substance, according to Payne. He's been told that \"it's fairly common\" for hospitals to waste liquid medicines down the sink.\n\nGeneral regulations\n\n\"There aren't too many contaminants that would build up in drinking water,\" said George Cushnie, technical director for the EPA-sponsored Healthcare Resource Center, which provides pollution prevention and environmental information to health care organizations.\n\nBecause most drinking water comes from rivers or reservoirs, \"you're constantly using water, and there's new water coming in, so there's really not an opportunity for it to build up.\"\n\nMike Focazio, program coordinator of the Geological Survey's Toxic Substances Hydrology Program, said his agency has not done testing of waste specifically coming out of hospitals, but it has done \"wastewater studies that come out of what we call sewer sheds -- in other words, a city or a town that does include hospitals.\"\n\n\"We have sampled that water for many years,\" he said. \"We have found that we can detect a variety of pharmaceutical residues at very low levels in quite a lot of different waste streams across the country.\"\n\n'Complicated' mixture of drugs\n\nPharmaceutical water contamination is common knowledge. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report on environmental health reads, \"pharmaceuticals may enter the environment and ultimately drinking water supplies in various ways, such as through the elimination of human and animal waste, disposal of unused medicines down the toilet or drain, veterinary drug usage, hospital waste disposal, and industrial discharges.\"\n\nWhat is unknown, Focazio said, is how much of that is due to hospitals versus people in their homes discarding unused medicines or simply metabolizing medicines, which we excrete in urine and feces that flows into our toilets.\n\nCushnie said his \"gut feeling is, most likely, households are discharging a lot more of their unused meds into the sewer system than hospitals.\" He believes that a larger number of people are using and disposing medications at home compared with the number of patients lying in hospital beds.\n\nWhether pharmaceutical residues in water samples come from hospital or home use, Focazio said, the concentration levels are much higher in some places than in others.\n\n\"If you look at the concentrations that we detect -- even at those high concentrations -- and you compare it to the dose that somebody would take -- even in, again, those places with very high levels or higher than elsewhere -- you'd have to drink enormous amounts of water just to get back to that prescribed dose,\" Focazio said.\n\n\"But the question is: What does it mean from a health standpoint when these low levels get out into the environment?\" he said. The human health effects are unknown. And it's not just one drug, say, one particular antidepressant. It's many brands and types of antidepressants plus an assortment of antihistamines and anti-inflammatories and all sorts of other pharmaceuticals mixed together.\n\n\"It gets very complicated very fast,\" Focazio said.\n\nMedicine or poison?\n\nIncreasingly, environmental scientists are wondering whether the very substances that are meant to cure us -- medicines -- might also pose a threat to our health when found in drinking water. As a result, pharmaceuticals have been listed as \" contaminants of emerging concern \" by the EPA.\n\nIn some cases, contaminants of emerging concern have probably been discharged into the environment for a long time before new and more sensitive detection methods could identify them, notes a GAO report . Harms to aquatic life have been documented by a number of studies , yet possible negative effects for human health are inconclusive. The EPA has begun the process of revising its existing guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.\n\nOther public health agencies, including the UN's World Health Organization, express similar concerns and findings as the EPA. \"There is a substantial margin of safety between the very low concentrations of pharmaceuticals that would be consumed in drinking-water and the minimum therapeutic doses, which suggests a very low risk to human health,\" a recent WHO report finds.\n\n'A whole soup of drugs'\n\nDr. David J.C. Constable, science director of the American Chemical Society's Green Chemistry Institute, explained the rationale behind the WHO report, though he was not involved in it or in decisions made at the EPA.\n\n\"When you take a drug, it is given at a dose which causes a desired therapeutic effect. However, it will cause some physiological response at a lower dose,\" Constable wrote in an email. \"This difference in response vs effect gives a significant margin of safety for most drugs.\" This is why WHO says concentrations well below therapeutic effect are very low risk to human health, he said.\n\nMae Wu, a senior attorney in the health program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said one of its big questions and concerns is that the EPA and other groups, when examining the safety of pharmaceuticals in drinking water, may be basing their assessment on the \"therapeutic\" levels approved by the FDA.\n\n\"But the reality is, once it gets into our drinking water, we are not talking about any one drug, right? We're talking about a whole soup of drugs, and for every location, it's a different mixture,\" she said.\n\nThough toxicologists test chemicals in combinations, they do not test each and every unique combination of mixed drugs and other chemicals found in the sewers of individual cities in the United States.\n\nWu also said that most FDA-approved drugs have been tested only in adults. Young babies and children do not participate in clinical trials that test adult medications for safety and effectiveness, she said, yet babies and children \"are often more vulnerable and more sensitive to these types of things.\"\n\n\"We definitely don't know what's happening there,\" she said.\n\nConstable believes that \"the question of mixtures is what has people in the EPA most concerned.\" The assumption is that the cocktail of chemicals in drinking water, food and air \"can't be good for you,\" he wrote. \"There is a fear of synergistic effects; that is, 1+1 > 2, or that the presence of one compound decreases the body's ability to metabolize another.\"\n\n'Multigenerational impacts'?\n\nThere are additional concerns that low-concentration exposures to chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, are leading to \"multigenerational impacts\" that we have not been able to discern, he said.\n\n\"The problem for everyone is that we just don't really have a good handle on this. No one does, and the debate is that the precautionary principle should be applied,\" Constable wrote in an email. That principle amounts to \"if we don't know, there is no acceptable level,\" he said, and once that point is reached, science begins to devolve into \"a discussion of policy.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince the late '90s, when scientists learned of a variety of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, in the nation's waterways, \"there was a lot of activity by the government and the Pharma industry to systematically assess the extent of pharmaceuticals in the environment,\" Constable wrote. A great deal of work has been going into this \"over many years,\" he said.\n\nFocazio said the US Geological Survey has started looking more recently not just at what can be detected but at \"what does it mean from a health standpoint.\"\n\n\"The human health aspect of this is a little bit out of our wheelhouse, so we are working with other public health agencies to give them the data so at least they know what the levels are,\" he said. The Geological Survey has begun studies on fish and aquatic biota to see how these other life forms are affected.\n\nAwaiting more extensive research into human health effects, simple solutions at the hospital level may be available.\n\n\"There is a company that has a safe box that comes with a neutralizing solution in it that can be used for wasting narcotics, but I have yet to see anyone use it,\" Deesy said, adding that she's asked several hospitals \"to investigate using them with no response.\"\n\nAwareness among hospital staff is also key, she said, and though she tried repeatedly to raise the awareness of health care administrators through local media, she once again hit a brick wall of \"no response.\"\n\n\"We don't need to be destroying our water,\" Deesy said. \"We should be taking care of our water.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "The impact homelessness and the opioid crisis are having on San Francisco streets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/spGi0Rn2zHM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "San Francisco (CNN) Outside the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in downtown San Francisco, a woman urinates on the sidewalk and smokes a crack pipe.\n\nInside her purse are about a dozen used heroin needles. She shoots heroin up to 10 times per day, she says.\n\nAbout 50 yards away, a man injects another woman in the neck with a needle. She puts her thumb in her mouth and blows on it to make her vein more visible. Her right arm is caked with dried blood.\n\nCNN obscured parts of this photo to protect the identity of the subjects.\n\nThis San Francisco neighborhood is home to the headquarters of Uber, Twitter and Salesforce. But stroll around here, and you're also likely to find used drug paraphernalia, trash, and human excrement on the sidewalks, and people lying in various states of consciousness.\n\nPublic drug usage and homelessness are not new problems for the city of San Francisco. But residents say the situation has gotten worse in recent years. As of October, 7,500 complaints about discarded needles have been made this year, compared with 6,363 last year. In 2015, the number was less than 3,000.\n\nIt's moved some locals -- so-called \"video vigilantes\" -- to document the mess they see, in an attempt to get the city's attention.\n\nAdam Mesnick, a restaurateur who lives and works in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, started posting daily photos and videos of people using drugs in public, urinating near his restaurant, or lying passed out on the sidewalk.\n\n\"More mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco,\" Mesnick wrote in one post, accompanied by photos of angry sores on people's backs, hands and legs.\n\nmore mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco, homeless addicts.

In another, human feces lies nestled in front of a doorway. In a video apparently taken from inside Mesnick's restaurant, a man can be seen urinating in a doorway across the street.\n\nMesnick isn't trying to shame homeless people with his Twitter posts, he says, but \"to actually find help for these people.\" He's been giving leftover food from his restaurant to the homeless for the past ten years, he said.\n\nOver the past five or six years, Mesnick says, visible homelessness and drug use on the streets have seemed to spread from areas of San Francisco where they were once concentrated, like the Tenderloin.\n\nThis has been like this since Friday. Yes today is Monday. pic.twitter.com/d91e9MU2VY \u2014 bettersoma (@bettersoma) October 29, 2018\n\n\"It's like third world squalor,\" Mesnick said. \"I'm a small business (owner) trying to exist, and basically surrounded by decay that continues to get worse and worse and worse.\"\n\nOthers fear that the situation will impact tourism. \"If we can't find a solution to this problem,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, CEO of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, \"it will tarnish the city's brand.\"\n\nAnother longtime resident tweets about the state of the neighborhood using the handle @cleanupwestsoma. He asked to remain anonymous because his friends don't know he runs the account, and says he's lived in San Francisco for 21 years, 12 of them in SoMa.\n\n\"I post as I go to work. I'll sometimes come home from lunch and see a giant drug deal going on,\" he said. \"I'll leave and go back to work and see someone going to the bathroom in the street. It blows me away that this continues to happen in the city.\"\n\nMesnick and @cleanupwestsoma want to send a message to city officials about what's happening in their neighborhoods. They often tweet at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who took office in a special election in July after the death of Mayor Ed Lee.\n\n\"You know what? I already had the message, as a native San Franciscan, as someone who's been here all my life,\" Breed told CNN. \"It isn't acceptable.\"\n\nBreed, 44, made tackling homelessness and drug addiction a signature of her campaign platform. She says the city has been making changes since she took office, and that they're slowly starting to have an impact. \"It's not an unsolvable problem,\" she said.\n\nLast week, the mayor announced a detailed plan to direct a $181 million cash windfall the city received from the state to homelessness, affordable housing and related problems. The proposal includes nearly $20 million to be spent on beds for patients who have addiction and mental health problems. An additional $4 million would go toward expanding street cleaning.\n\nAnd Breed says visible progress has already been made.\n\n\"If you walk with me right now, you will see the difference,\" she said. \"You'll see more police officers. You'll see the homeless outreach team. You'll see people power-washing on a regular basis and picking up trash.\" Tent encampments are down by 27% since she took office, she said.\n\nKevin Schwing, who works in SoMa, said that despite the city's efforts, he doesn't see a change in the numbers of people on the streets.\n\n\"I don't really know what the city can do,\" he said. \"The city cleans up sidewalks every day. But I don't see any difference in terms of the amount of people.\"\n\n\"I see human waste. Injections. Probably 10 times per day,\" he said. \"Sometimes people look like they're dead.\"\n\nBreed says the city is cracking down on drug dealing, and aims to open at least 1,000 new shelter beds by the end of 2020.\n\nAnd she's looking at new ways to approach these entrenched problems, she says. Breed supports safe injection sites -- facilities where people can inject heroin in a private setting and under the supervision of health care workers. The sites would \"not only be a way to get people off the streets and get the needles off the streets, but to get people into treatment,\" Breed said. California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have allowed safe injection sites in the state.\n\nShe also supports conservatorship programs for the severely mentally ill, which would allow the state to \"make decisions for them in order to place them into mental health stabilization beds, instead of our criminal justice system.\" Gov. Brown recently signed a bill that would allow such action to take place.\n\nBreed says she hopes the \"video vigilantes\" tag 311, the city's non-emergency complaint service center, in their posts. The information they're putting out helps the city address challenges in specific neighborhoods, she said.\n\nThe city's Department of Public Health recently partnered with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, essentially hiring contract workers to fan the streets and collect used needles.\n\nCrisis intervention teams have also stepped up their efforts to provide addicts with the drug buprenorphine, a narcotic to help reduce a person's addiction to heroin and other opioids.\n\n\"We go to people that are using drugs and offer them treatment instead of the traditional model which has people coming into a clinic,\" said Dr. Naveena Bobba, the department's deputy director of health.\n\nThe city has also launched the so-called \"poop patrol,\" a team that responds to complaints of feces on city streets.\n\nSoMa resident Alesia Panajota said she sees an impact. \"They're doing the best they can,\" she said. \"I think things are getting better under London Breed.\"\n\nSan Francisco may also see an influx of cash to help solve the crisis, after a controversial ballot measure passed in November. Known as \"Prop C,\" the measure is viewed as a \"homeless tax\" -- it aims to raise $300 million a year to spend on homeless services by taxing big businesses.\n\nSalesforce Chairman and Co-CEO Marc Benioff spent at least $7 million of his own money to help ensure Prop C's passage. \"We have to say enough is enough,\" he recently told CNN.\n\nBut legal challenges could prevent the city from receiving the funds for several years.\n\nIn the meantime, Mesnick keeps posting. He recently put up a video interview with a homeless man talking about how difficult it is to find a place to go to the bathroom after dark.\n\n\"Help this guy,\" Mesnick wrote. \"Keep the restrooms open at night? Perhaps we change usage of our space and make it a bathroom share? Better than on our front stoop...\"\n\n\"We are in a severe epidemic here,\" he told CNN. \"My angle may seem to be a little rough around the edges, but it's really about compassion.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "One city's answer to preventing teen e-cigarette use: Sell in adult-only stores", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/a0oHJ8rqllg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Attempting to beat back the rise of vaping among teens, the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, voted this month to limit e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes to the shelves of tobacco stores open only to customers 21 and older.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Massachusetts raising the legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21, which goes into effect on December 31.\n\nSomerville's move, the first of its kind in the state and possibly the nation, goes further by taking menthol and e-cigarettes out of shops, like convenience stores, that teens can enter.

When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?\"\n\nThere are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.\n\n\"Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,\" she adds.\n\nAdopt a dog\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are particular health benefits in adopting a dog, says Dr Rhys Thatcher\n\nA gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.\n\nBut though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University.\n\nInstead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping.\n\nBut there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says.\n\nIf you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption.\n\n\"This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,\" says Dr Thatcher.\n\nGet your 30 a week\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say diversity of plant-based foods is also important\n\nWe have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nBut according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity.\n\nWe should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.\n\nThat is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health.\n\nThe bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.\n\nAllergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOne way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi.\n\n\"Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix. Instead of buying one type of seed buy the four-seed mix,\" she says.\n\nSmile more often\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do not spend so much time focusing on arbitrary matters, do something that makes you smile instead\n\nAfter the excesses of the holiday season, many of us will be planning to lose a couple of stone or setting a target for how many times we go to the gym each week.\n\nBut the problem with \"arbitrary\" goals like these is that they are often difficult to achieve and failing to reach them can be demoralising, says Dr James Gill.\n\nInstead, he recommends focusing first on trying to be happier.\n\n\"There are lists of specific things that you can do to actively make your life healthier, but if you are not enjoying your life you probably won't stick to any difficult or challenging changes for the coming year,\" says Dr Gill, a locum GP and researcher at Warwick Medical School.\n\nBut how do you go about becoming happier?\n\nDr Gill recommends making one change in your life that will make you smile more often. At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it.\n\n\"Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year.\"\n\nAnd finally, get enough sleep\n\nIt may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults).\n\nEven being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter.\n\nThere are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.\n\nBut Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "How to resist 'drink pushers' during the festive season", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46632332", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:54", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Midnight Oil Image caption Actor Stephen McGann gets indignant with those who try to make him drink alcohol\n\nWhen actor Stephen McGann recently tweeted about his frustration with people who pressurised others to drink alcohol, he received an outpouring of support on social media.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @StephenMcGann As Christmas gears up again, a quick seasonal request.

If they choose not to socialise because they will be exposed to alcohol, then they might alienate themselves and suffer from loneliness.\n\n\"The [buying a] round system is also an issue, it's lovely and generous, but it's difficult to resist.\"\n\nGriffin suggests working out a strategy in advance, and prioritising your own needs.\n\nAs awareness of the health risks grow, not drinking, or cutting back on drinking, is becoming increasingly common. Everyone is in agreement. If someone says no to a drink, don't ask twice.\n\nFollow Laurel Ives on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: Indonesian volcano's dramatic collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46707731", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently\n\nThe scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear.\n\nResearchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea.\n\nThey say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week.\n\nMuch of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement.\n\nIt would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra.\n\nIndonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing. In excess of 40,000 have been displaced.\n\nThe Centre of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) has been studying pictures from a number of radar satellites, including the European Union's Sentinel-1 constellation and the German TerraSAR-X platform.\n\nRadar has the advantage of being able to see the ground day or night, and to be able to pierce cloud.\n\nThe capability has allowed some initial measurements to be made of Anak Krakatau's lost stature, in particular on its western side.\n\nWhat was once a volcanic cone standing some 340m high is now just 110m tall, says the PVMBG.\n\nIn terms of volume, 150-170 million cubic metres of material has gone, leaving only 40-70 million cubic metres still in place.\n\nImage copyright JAXA Image caption The Japanese Alos-2 radar satellite is also being used to monitor Anak Krakatau\n\nQuite how much mass was lost on 22 December itself and how much in the following days is unknown. Scientists may have a better idea once they have had a chance to visit the volcano and conduct more extensive surveys.\n\nBut with the eruptions still ongoing and a safety exclusion zone in force - no-one is going near Anak Krakatau.\n\nCone collapse with tsunami generation was considered a potential hazard before last Saturday.\n\nScientists had modelled the possibility six years ago, even identifying the western flank of Anak Krakatau as the section of the volcano most likely to fail.\n\nThe study, although simulating a larger event, predicted wave heights and coastal inundation times that were remarkably similar to what actually happened."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Madagascar pochard: World's rarest bird gets new home", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46703335", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Conservationists hope to save a species of duck called the Madagascar pochard from extinction\n\nThe rarest bird in the world - a species of duck called the Madagascar pochard - has been given a new home in time for the new year.\n\nAn international team of researchers released 21 of the birds at a lake in the north of Madagascar.\n\nIt is a step towards the recovery of a species that just over a decade ago was thought to be extinct.\n\nRescuing the species could also be a first step in protecting Madagascar's threatened wetlands.\n\nWhy is this species under such threat?\n\nWhen it wasn't seen for 15 years, the Madagascar pochard was believed to have been wiped out completely.

We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade.\n\n\"Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.\"\n\nThe team hopes that making this reintroduction a success - and bringing back a bird that was on the very brink of extinction - will provide a powerful example, not just for how to save the most threatened species but how communities can support both people and wildlife in such valuable habitats, even in areas of significant poverty.\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: How a tsunami could wipe out the last Javan rhinos", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46691120", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright WWF Image caption The entire species of Javan rhinos could be wiped out by a tsunami\n\nConservationists have warned that the entire species of the critically endangered Javan rhino could be wiped out if a tsunami were to strike again.\n\nThey once roamed the jungles of South East Asia and India, but today only 67 exist in the Ujung Kulon National Park, which was hit by last week's tsunami.\n\nThe park sits in the shadow of Anak Krakatau, the volcano which triggered waves that killed hundreds of people.\n\nThe volcano remains active and officials are now rushing to move them.\n\nTwo park officials were among the 430 killed by the tsunami, and numerous park buildings and ships were also destroyed when the tsunami hit last Saturday.\n\nBut the Javan rhinos left in the park - the only ones left in the world - were left unscathed.\n\nThe rhinos typically live along the park's south coast and this tsunami hit the north coast - many are keenly aware that the rhinos might not be so lucky if there is another disaster.\n\nAn entire species in danger\n\nThe Javan rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species in the world - and have been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThey were once found in northeast India and across South East Asia but their population was quickly depleted as a result of poaching, habitat destruction through agriculture, among other factors.\n\nImage copyright Wwf Image caption Only 67 Javan rhinos exist today\n\nAccording to the WWF, Vietnam's last Javan rhino was poached in 2010.\n\n\"As there are no Javan rhinos in captivity anywhere in the world, should we lose this population, we've essentially lost the entire species,\" said Nicola Loweth, a WWF officer in a statement about the rhinos in Indonesia.\n\nThe search for the perfect location\n\nAnak Krakatau began showing increased signs of volcanic activity since June earlier this year.\n\nBut it was last Saturday that volcanic activity from Anak Krakatau is believed to have set off undersea landslides, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 430 people so far.\n\nAuthorities say Anak Krakatau is still active, and is in fact becoming increasingly active with what are known as Strombolian eruptions - short lived, explosive blasts of lava - being emitted.\n\n\"We understand that we cannot let the Javan rhinos live only in Ujung Julon,\" Widodo Sukohadi Ramono, chairman of the Rhino Foundation of Indonesian (YABI) told BBC News Indonesia.\n\nMr Ramono added that there were plans in place to move a smaller group of rhinos to a secondary location, though there was \"a lot [to be taken into] consideration\".\n\nThe rhinos which would be moved would have to be in good health, have close ties to each other and able to reproduce.\n\nBut moving the rhinos to another location is easier said than done.\n\nThe new location would have to have more than 200 species of plants - food sources for the Javan rhino. It would also need to have a plentiful water supply, an ideal soil type, land condition and a place with a year-round wet climate.\n\n\"It's difficult to find the perfect location... we need at least five thousand hectares in one location.

Two journalists among the detainees were reportedly later released.\n\nThe announcement also came after Sudanese doctors launched an indefinite strike on Monday, while trade unions and other professional associations called for a nationwide work stoppage.\n\n181226182021425\n\n\"The doctors' strike will continue until we see a peaceful handover of power.

This year was full of a lot of surprises from US President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nFrom a number of high-level departures to his recent decision to pull US troops out of Syria, despite opposition from many within his own party and inner circle, Trump never ceased to abruptly interrupt the news cycle with a new development or announcement.\n\nBut it's also the things that didn't make the front page or the lead story, they may also have you surprised.\n\nHere are 10 things the Trump administration did that you may have missed this year:\n\n1. Fewer Refugees\n\nIn 2018, fewer refugees made it into the US than any time during the previous 40 years. That's because the Trump administration followed a campaign promise to cap the number of people coming to the United States.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration reduced that limit again from 45,000 to 30,000. The year 2019 could see the lowest number of refugee admissions in US history.\n\n180917225659912\n\nThe move follows remarks the president made throughout 2018 aimed at immigrants and refugees. In one closed-door White House meeting, according to the Washington Post and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, Trump referred to Haiti, African countries and some Latin American countries as \"s***holes\" and wondered aloud why the US was letting anyone in from those regions.\n\nHis administration has also sought to put limits on who can request asylum. This month, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to the Trump, refusing to allow the administration to implement new rules prohibiting asylum for people who cross the US border between official ports of entry. A lower court has also blocked policies put in place by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this year that made it harder for individuals fleeing domestic violence and gang violence to claim asylum.\n\n2. Trump cuts Pakistan aid\n\nIn a New Year's Day tweet, Trump took aim at Pakistan arguing, \"the United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years.\" He vowed that would end. And, it did. In September, during the Labor Day holiday, military assistance to Pakistan ended. The $300m, according to a Pentagon spokesperson, would be \"reprogrammed\" for \"other urgent priorities\".\n\n180902060147916\n\nThe US military has accused Pakistan of giving safe haven to groups that target US soldiers in Afghanistan. Islamabad has persistently denied the charges even though al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US forces in Abbottabad in 2011, less than a mile from a Pakistani military training academy.\n\n3. Possible sexual assault rule change\n\nIn November, while Washington, DC, was distracted with Jim Acosta's White House credentials and the Russia investigation, Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued a Friday proposal to alter the rules when it comes to how sexual assaults and harassment are handled on school campuses.\n\nAlthough DeVos said the changes were designed to make reporting \"more transparent, consistent, and reliable in their processes and outcomes,\" groups advocating on behalf of sexual assault survivors decried it as an attempt to give more power to the accused and lessen the legal burden on schools.\n\nOne controversial provision allows the person who is accused to cross-examine the accuser through representatives.\n\n\"If these draft rules become law,\" said Sage Carson, manager for Know Your Title IX, \"more survivors will be forced out of school by harassment, assault, and their schools' indifference to their complaints.\"\n\n4. Climate change report buried\n\nNormally, US administrations use the day after the Thanksgiving holiday (a Friday) to bury uncomfortable news.\n\n181126210505194\n\nIn 2018, that news came in the form of an annual government report on climate change. Since his election to office, Trump has repeatedly questioned whether climate change is real.\n\n\"Whatever happened to Global Warming?\" he tweeted in November after a spate of cold weather hit the US. That thinking may have guided the decision to bury the report, released the day after Thanksgiving when most Americans weren't paying attention, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It not only declares climate change is real but it is getting worse, threatening coastal communities in the US.\n\n\"The severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur,\" the report states. In 2017, Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, a historic international agreement on climate change aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n5. The election was rigged \u2026 or not\n\nJust three days into 2018, Trump quietly got rid of a commission ending a taxpayer-funded venture that many people considered a waste of time and money. The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity was formed in May 2017 to investigate one of Trump's main claims about the 2016 Presidential contest: it was rigged.\n\n181101162845044\n\nAlthough Trump won the election, his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, earned nearly three million more votes. Under the American electoral college system, the popular vote does not guarantee victory. Nevertheless, Trump disliked the idea that more people wanted Clinton to be president. The commission's official mandate was to \"study vulnerabilities in voting systems used for federal elections that could lead to improper voter registrations, improper voting, fraudulent voter registrations, and fraudulent voting\". It was created around Trump's unfounded claim that millions of people voted illegally for Clinton in 2016.\n\nHowever, the commission was marred with infighting and legal battles and, in the end, found zero evidence of voter fraud. After it disbanded, the commission's vice-chair, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, was found in contempt of court by a federal judge in a voter suppression case.\n\n6. National debt soars\n\nAs a businessman-candidate, Trump ran for president on the premise he knows how to save money and cut waste. More importantly, he promised to get rid of the US national debt, a sore spot for many Republican legislators for many years.\n\nAs president, the debt has continued to inflate under Trump. As of mid-December, US national debt was roughly $21.8 trillion. When Trump took office in January, 2017, it was $19.9 trillion. Spending on the military and programmes like social security and Medicare increased in 2018 and there is no indication Trump will take any significant action to reduce it. According to the Congressional Budget Office, interest on the debt is one of the fastest growing payments in the annual budget. They also project overall spending to increase by 5.5 percent a year over the next 10 years.\n\nIronically, Trump's Republican Party made spending controls its signature issue throughout the administration of President Barack Obama and orchestrated a partial government down in 2013 as a result of it.\n\n7. Endangered species under attack?\n\nEver since Trump took over, environmentalists and animal-rights activists have warned that protections for wildlife are on his target list. The president has persistently criticised government regulations that get in the way of big business. In July, the administration announced a proposal to strip the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of some key provisions.\n\n181124070729255\n\nWhile only a proposal, the request has set off alarm bells within some of the biggest environmental organisations. The Sierra Club, which boasts 3.5 million members, bluntly warned the law is \"under attack\". If implemented, the Sierra Club argues, the regulation changes would loosen protections for certain animals and fish like the gray wolf, right whale and sage-grouse. In a Washington Post op-ed in August, Interior deputy secretary David Bernhardt called aspects of the ESA an \"unnecessary regulatory burden\".\n\n8. Trump boosts overseas military spending\n\nIn August, Trump signed off on one of the largest budgets for the US military in history. At a whopping $717bn, the 2019 American defence budget is bigger than that of China, India, the UK, France and Russia combined. \"We are going to strengthen our military like never ever before,\" the president boasted after authorising the spending during a ceremony at Fort Drum in New York. Within that budget is money for the same overseas military spending Trump once criticised his predecessors. Trump has consistently wondered aloud why Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama spent trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In his 2019 budget, Trump increased military spending in both countries.\n\n9. Calls to end chain migration \u2026 except for Trump family\n\nTrump hates chain migration. He has said it many times. \"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,\" Trump told Americans in his annual state of the union address in January. \"Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.\"\n\n180810135040869\n\nThis apparent distaste, however, did not apply to his own family. In August, Amalja and Viktor Knav, the parents of First Lady Melania Trump, walked into a New York government building and took their oath to become American citizens. They are both from Slovenia. How did they get their citizenship? Through their daughter's marriage to Trump or, put another way, chain migration. When asked whether the Knavs' case was a textbook example of the practice, their own lawyer replied, \"I suppose so.\"\n\n10. Trump poses in photo with conspiracy theorist\n\nThere's no doubt the current occupant of the White House sometimes traffics in falsehoods. He has claimed, then retracted, his belief former US President Barack Obama wiretapped him, said people were rioting in California over sanctuary cities and suggested midterm election voters put on disguises so they could cast ballots multiple times. All those claims are incorrect.\n\n181030150744871\n\nSo, in August, when Trump posed for a photo in the Oval Office with the proponent of a conspiracy theory, he seemed to be taking his false assertions to a new level. The visitor, Lionel Lebron, is one of the biggest advocates for a theory that gained significant traction in 2018.\n\nKnown as \"QAnon\" or \"Q\", it's a conspiracy pushed primarily by pro-Trump social media stars and makes all sorts of unfounded claims about the president's opponents, centring around a fictitious belief that prominent Democrats are running a paedophile ring. In August, \"Q\" posters and t-shirts followed the president everywhere. Lebron later tweeted that he never brought up QAnon with Trump."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Two-year-old Yemeni boy whose mother sued US to see him dies", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/2-year-yemeni-boy-mother-sued-dies-181229153016016.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "The two-year-old son of a Yemeni woman who sued the Trump administration to let her into the country to be with the ailing boy has died, the Council on American-Islamic Relations has announced.\n\nAbdullah Hassan died on Friday in UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland in the United States, where his father Ali Hassan brought him to get treatment for a genetic brain disorder.\n\nAli Hassan is a US citizen who lives in Stockton, California.

Although no full-scale war broke out in 2018, as some had expected, it did bring a grim year of deadly violence, illegal settlement expansion and home demolitions.\n\nAt least 289 Palestinians - men, women and children - were killed throughout 2018, while thousands of others were wounded, including many who were maimed for life by Israeli gunfire. According to the Defense for Children organisation, the death toll includes 56 Palestinian children - an average of more than one child every week.\n\nAt least 538 housing units and facilities were demolished in the occupied West Bank, resulting in 1,300 Palestinians losing their homes, a report by the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Centre for Studies and Documentation said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza is still ongoing, which the United Nations has repeatedly warned is having a devastating effect on the strip's two million population.\n\nOn an internal level, the national reconciliation talks between rival governments of Hamas and Fatah, who control the Gaza Strip and pockets of the West Bank respectively, have made precious little progress. The division in Palestinian politics continued for the 11th year running, as the main deadlock remains centred on allowing the Palestinian Authority full control over security forces in the Gaza Strip, including the military wing of Hamas.\n\nA number of jarring decisions made by the United States, such as moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, finally convinced the Palestinian leadership of the US' bias in the conflict. President Donald Trump has also declared an end to the funding of the main UN refugee agency for Palestinians, putting five million refugees in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries such as Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, at risk of not receiving food aid, education, vocational training, jobs and much more.\n\nHere is a recap of the main events that shook the Palestinian territories in 2018:\n\nAhmad Jarar \u2013 February 6\n\nThe violence in 2018 began with a Palestinian shooting dead a Jewish settler on January 9 near the occupied West Bank city of Nablus. The shooter fled the scene, which prompted Israeli forces to go on a manhunt that lasted almost one month.\n\nOn February 6, Israeli soldiers assassinated Ahmad Jarrar. The 22-year-old was killed in a shoot-out from his hiding place in the village of Yamoun, some nine kilometres from his hometown of Jenin. His body was taken by Israel forces, who have a policy of seizing bodies - a practice condemned by international law.\n\nThe pursuit of Jarrar resulted in almost daily raids of various towns and villages in the West Bank. Three homes belonging to the Jarrar family were demolished, and two Palestinians, including Jarrar's cousin Ahmad Ismail Jarrar, were killed in separate raids.\n\nResidents reported that the Israeli forces used loudspeakers to call out, \"Ahmad Jarrar, turn yourself in or we will demolish the village house by house.\"\n\nGaza's Great March of Return protests - March 30\n\nOn March 30, Palestinians from all backgrounds staged the first weekly Friday protest near the Israeli fence, east of the Gaza Strip. Demonstrators have been calling for the right of return for Palestinian refugees to their lands (under UN Resolution 194) and are demanding an end to the 12-year Israeli blockade.\n\nAsad Abu Sharekh, spokesperson for the campaign, told Al Jazeera that the march is meant to send a message to the international community to actively support the right of Palestinians to return to their lands.\n\nAccording to health officials in Gaza, to date, Israeli forces have killed at least 220 Palestinians in the besieged coastal enclave and wounded more than 18,000 people.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the Gaza population is dependent on humanitarian assistance, while the strip experiences regular power outages and high unemployment. It has been dubbed as the world's largest open-air prison, with Palestinians needing Israeli army permits to enter and exit the enclave.\n\nUS embassy move to Jerusalem - May 14\n\nThe Trump administration delivered on its promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, ignoring worldwide condemnation and protests from outraged Palestinians.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, who also serves as a senior adviser to Trump.\n\nMany of Jerusalem's Palestinian areas were shut down on the day, with an increased presence of Israeli police on the streets. The closures spread to occupied East Jerusalem, where access to the Old City was curtailed in areas leading to it such as al-Tur, Mount of Olives, Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan.\n\nYet, Israel's bloody response took place in the Gaza Strip during Palestinian protests near the fence, where 61 protesters were shot dead.\n\nMore than 2,400 others were also wounded as the Israeli army fired live ammunition, tear gas and firebombs at protesters assembled along several points near the fence with Israel.\n\n70th anniversary of the Nakba - May 15\n\nPalestinians commemorated 70 years since the Nakba, or \"catastrophe\", which is defined as the removal of 750,000 of the population from historical Palestine in 1948. Paramilitary Zionist groups seized or destroyed some 500 Palestinian villages and towns in the process, and have barred the resultant refugees from returning ever since.\n\nProtests took place in smaller Palestinian towns and villages, while the cities such as Ramallah and Bethlehem went on strike for the day, protesting against the killing of Palestinians in Gaza the day before.\n\nThe Israeli parliament, the Knesset, adopted the controversial legislation that defined Israel as \"the historical homeland of the Jewish people and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it\".\n\nThe bill makes Hebrew the country's national language and defines the establishment of Jewish communities as being in the national interest. It further marginalises the 1.8 million Palestinian citizens of Israel, who now have more than 65 Israeli laws that discriminate against them.\n\nIt also states that an undivided Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and strips Arabic of its designation as an official language, downgrading it to a \"special status\".\n\nAhed Tamimi freed from jail \u2013 July 29\n\nAhed Tamimi made international headlines when she was arrested in a pre-dawn raid on her home by Israeli forces in her village of Nabi Saleh, known for its weekly popular protests against the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe then 16-year-old was arrested by Israeli forces in December 2017 after a video went viral showing the teenager slapping two armed Israeli soldiers outside her home.\n\nAt the time, the teen was reacting to news that her 15-year-old cousin Mohammed had been shot in the face by Israeli forces with a rubber-coated steel bullet earlier in the day, leaving him in critical condition.\n\nTamimi was sentenced to eight months in prison. Her arrest drew international condemnation and again put the spotlight on Israel's treatment of Palestinians, especially Palestinian youth.\n\nUS UNRWA cuts \u2013 August 31\n\nThe US government, a major ally of Israel, announced it was stopping its funding to the UN Relief Works and Agency (UNRWA) after determining the organisation to be an \"irredeemably flawed operation\".\n\nUNRWA was established in 1949 after 700,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes by Zionist paramilitaries in the run-up to the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\nIt currently provides services to five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.\n\nDemolition of Khan al-Ahmar village on hold \u2013 October 23\n\nKhan al-Ahmar, located northeast of occupied East Jerusalem, has been under threat of demolition for several years.\n\nBut in September, the Israeli high court ruled that the Bedouin village, home to 180 people, will be demolished on October 1 under the pretext that it had been built without a permit.\n\nHowever, three weeks later, the Israeli government announced it was putting the demolition on hold for a \"short, fixed period of time\".\n\nThe village's location between two major Israeli settlements, Maale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, has been a thorn in the side of the Israeli government, which wants to expand the two in order to build a ring of settlements around East Jerusalem.\n\nKhan al-Ahmar is in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli control. In order to build anything, Palestinians living in the area need a permit that is rarely issued by Israeli authorities.\n\nNetanyahu official visit to Oman \u2013 October 25\n\nMarking what was the first visit by an Israeli leader to the sultanate in over two decades, Netanyahu's office said the visit came at the invitation of Sultan Qaboos and followed \"lengthy contacts between the two countries\".\n\nHis office added that it formed part of a policy of \"deepening relations with the states of the region\".\n\nOman and Israel do not have diplomatic relations. The visit was expected to increase pressure on Palestine to participate in US-led peace negotiations.\n\nThe last Israeli prime minister to visit Oman was Shimon Peres in 1996.\n\nOn October 29, Israeli Sports and Culture Minister Miri Regev's official visit to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi was seen by Palestinians as further proof that Arab countries were being swayed by Israel's bid for normalisation.\n\nA day before, Regev was present when the Israeli anthem was played for the first time in the UAE after an Israeli athlete won the gold medal in the Judo Grand Competition in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIsrael's botched undercover operation in Gaza Strip - November 11\n\nAn Israeli covert operations unit infiltrated the Gaza Strip and had their cover blown, resulting in the killing of seven Palestinians and one Israeli soldier.\n\nNour Baraka, a senior commander of the Qassam Brigades, was among those killed, as Israeli forces pounded the Khan Younis area with air raids to give the unit cover to escape back into Israel using a civilian car.\n\nBy November 13, seven more Palestinians were killed by Israeli air raids, which had targeted a number of residential and government-owned buildings such as the offices of the al-Aqsa television channel.\n\nThe latest round of fighting, which had raised fears of a fourth Israeli offensive on the strip since 2008, ended on the same day after Egypt brokered a ceasefire, leading Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's defence minister, to resign in protest.\n\nRamallah lockdown \u2013 December 13\n\nFollowing a night where Israel killed three Palestinians in separate raids in the occupied West Bank, an unknown Palestinian shooter killed two Israeli soldiers near the illegal settlement of Ofra before fleeing the scene.\n\nThis prompted the Israeli army to declare Ramallah a closed military zone, and carry out searches near areas of roads entering and exiting the city.\n\nA fourth Palestinian was also killed after what Israeli forces said was a car-ramming attempt. Palestinian witnesses, however, said Ardah lost control of his vehicle.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Red Crescent, 69 Palestinians were injured in protests against the Israeli army raids into Ramallah and various other towns and villages in the West Bank.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThere is little reason for optimism about the prospects for 2019. The new year looks to offer more in terms of stagnation in the Middle East peace process, as well as the national reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.\n\nWith the Trump administration firmly backing Israel on the international stage, and tacitly approving illegal settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, Palestinians will continue to regard the US as an impossible broker of peace talks.\n\nFurthermore, the so-called \"deal of the century\", reportedly pushed for by Trump's son-in-law Kushner, in all its ambiguity and what has been leaked to the media, has failed to win the approval of the Palestinian leadership.\n\nOn April 9, Israel will hold snap elections, for which Netanyahu called on Israeli voters to give the government a clear mandate to continue governing on its current path. However, the prime minister will first have to fend off prosecutors who are after him and his wife in a criminal case relating to receiving funds from wealthy benefactors.\n\nOn a domestic level, the unity talks between Fatah and Hamas are unlikely to witness a breakthrough.\n\nOn December 22, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared his intention to dissolve the largely defunct Palestinian parliament, the Palestinian Legislative Council, where Hamas holds a majority. Abbas, citing a Constitutional Court order, also announced that general elections would be held within six months of the PLC being dissolved.\n\nThe PLC has not held an official session since 2007, when Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip. The movement rejected Abbas' decision as an \"invalid political decision\".\n\nThere also seems little intent to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza, and the Israeli military presence shows no sign of abating in the West Bank. On a political level, optimism remains as elusive as ever."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Fresh off the passage of the farm bill, which reauthorized agriculture, conservation and safety net programs, the Agriculture Department last week announced a second round of direct payments to growers hardest hit by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nThen parts of the government shut down.\n\nThe USDA in a statement issued last week assured farmers that checks would continue to go out during the first week of the shutdown. But direct payments for farmers who haven\u2019t certified production, as well as farm loans and disaster assistance programs, will be put on hold beginning next week, and won\u2019t start up again until the government reopens.\n\nThere is little chance of the government shutdown ending soon. Trump and Congress are no closer to reaching a deal over his demand for border wall money, and both sides say the impasse could drag well into January.\n\nAlthough certain vital USDA programs will remain operational in the short term, that could change if the shutdown lasts for more than a few weeks.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, helps feed roughly 40 million Americans. According to the USDA, eligible recipients are guaranteed benefits through January. Other feeding programs, including WIC, which provides food aid and nutrition counseling for pregnant women, new mothers and children, and food distribution programs on Indian reservations, will continue on a local level, but additional federal funding won\u2019t be provided. School lunch programs will continue through February.\n\nUSDA has earmarked about $9.5 billion in direct payments for growers of soybeans, corn, wheat, sorghum and other commodities most affected by tariffs. The first round of payments went out in September. The deadline to sign up for the second round of payments is January 15.\n\nThe impact of the shutdown, which began shortly before most federal workers were scheduled for a holiday break, started coming into focus by midweek.\n\nAbout 420,000 employees are working without pay, while 380,000 are being forced to stay home. In the past, federal employees have been paid retroactively.

The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully, this will not be necessary.\u201d\n\nWhich led Kim Jong Un to announce during his New Year\u2019s address that the \u201centire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons,\u201d a statement linked to the successful Hwaseong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile test in November adding, \u201cThis is a reality, not a threat.\u201d\n\n\u200b2018 begins with hope\n\nFollowing Kim\u2019s Jan. 1 address, the tone on the peninsula changed. South Korea\u2019s president reached out to Pyongyang to partner with South Korea during the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s high-level delegation to the event included Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister, Kim Yo Jong. She attended the opening ceremony, sitting along side President Moon and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and was the first member of the ruling Kim family to cross the border since the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nYongwook Ryu of the Institute for North Korean Studies commented on the change taking place on the peninsula.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, we witnessed very high tensions, but beginning from 2018, hopes have been raised that Inter-Korean relations would improve [and that] the U.S.-North Korea relations also would improve,\u201d he said.\n\nIn April, Moon held the first of three summits with Kim. The pair agreed to work toward denuclearization, ease military tensions, and improve inter-Korean relations.\n\nTheir third summit in September brought about concrete plans to promote economic ties between the two countries and reduce the chances of skirmishes.\n\nIn June Trump and Kim met in Singapore. It was the first meeting ever between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. president.\n\nSignificant or window dressing?\n\nRyu calls the April inter-Korean summit and the June Singapore summit two of the most significant events during the past year.\n\nHe said the Panmunjom Declaration, signed by Moon and Kim in April \u201cwas a significant improvement on all the previous inter-Korean summit decorations in terms of making progress in inter-Korean relations with a number of integration projects that seek to develop [the] North Korean economy and invite North Korea to the international community.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Asan Institute\u2019s Seong Whun Cheon downplayed the importance of the summits, criticizing the lack of concrete outcomes and noting Kim Jong Un made his intentions clear during his New Year\u2019s address.\n\n\u201cThey (the summits) are not big moments \u2026 it\u2019s window dressing without substance,\u201d Cheon said.\n\n\u201cIn order to understand the current issue we\u2019re facing,\u201d he added, \u201cI think we have to read his [New Year\u2019s address] very carefully once again. The first thing he did \u2026 was to proclaim that he accomplished his mission of becoming a nuclear weapon [state].\u201d\n\nHe said that Kim further ordered North Korea to \u201cmass produce\u201d nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles before beginning his economic and cultural engagement policies with the world.\n\nSince the third inter-Korean summit in September, North Korea denuclearization talks have stalled and their future remains unknown as 2019 approaches.\n\n\u200b2019 unclear\n\nDuring the September inter-Korean summit, Moon invited Kim to visit Seoul. It was a visit that he had hoped would take place before 2019 arrived, but that looks nearly impossible. The Moon administration is still hopeful a visit could take place in early 2019, but no details have been made public.\n\nLikewise, Trump has indicated a willingness to meet for a second time with Kim in early 2019, but details of such a summit remain absent.\n\nCheon would like world leaders to take advantage of the \u201coptimistic moment\u201d and persuade Kim Jong Un to abandon his nuclear weapons, creating a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\n\u201cThe yardstick to use whether the past year was successful in terms of increasing peace and security on the Korean Peninsula is whether Kim Jong Un has made a full commitment [and] to give up nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, in his assessment, Kim has not made such a commitment, and Cheon predicts the current impasse with North Korea will continue for years to come, if not decades.\n\nRyu sees a number of likely scenarios taking place in the forthcoming year.\n\n\u201cI think the best scenario for everybody is [for] Kim Jong Un [to change] his mind and become serious about denuclearization,\u201d he said, \u201cIf he takes steps towards denuclearization, then South Korea, USA, along with many other countries in the international community would provide economic benefits to his government. And that\u2019s good for him.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cunless we see an entirely different North Korean society [that] have a different view about nuclear weapons \u2026 we cannot change anything,\u201d Cheon said.\n\nCheon believes the key to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is transforming North Korean society and making the population \u201cbelieve nuclear weapons are actually harmful\u201d and negatively affect their \u201cpersonal and their country\u2019s prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe noted this is not something that can be achieved quickly, but is a \u201clong-term game.\u201d\n\nIf no real progress is made on North Korean denuclearization, Ryu thinks it may be likely that more pressure may be applied to Pyongyang, and events could return to levels of tension last seen in 2017.\n\nLee Ju-hyun contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "2-Year-old Yemeni Boy Whose Mom Sued US to see Him Has Died", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/year-old-yemeni-boy-whose-mom-sued-us-to-see-him-has-died/4721102.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The 2-year-old son of a Yemeni woman who sued the Trump administration to let her into the country to be with the ailing boy has died, the Council on American-Islamic Relations announced.\n\nAbdullah Hassan died Friday in UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland, where his father Ali Hassan brought him in the fall to get treatment for a genetic brain disorder.\n\nAli Hassan is a U.S. citizen who lives in Stockton, California.

They show no signs of bending, either.\n\n\u201cWe are far apart,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told CBS on Friday.\n\nTrump tweeted: \u201cWe will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with.\u201d He also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, among countries he deems have not done enough to combat illegal immigration.\n\nHe\u2019s made similar threats in the past without following through, and it is Congress, not the president, that appropriates aid money.\n\nThe shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay.\n\nTrump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said Democrats are no longer negotiating with the administration over an earlier offer by the White House to accept less than the $5 billion Trump wants for the wall.\n\nDemocrats said the White House offered to accept $2.5 billion for border security, but that Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told Vice President Mike Pence that it wasn\u2019t acceptable. It was also not guaranteed that Trump would settle for that amount.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single Democrat talking to the president of the United States about this deal,\u201d Mulvaney said Friday\n\nSpeaking on Fox News and later to reporters, he tried to drive a wedge between Democrats, pinning the blame on House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMulvaney said Schumer was \u201creally interested in doing a deal and coming to some sort of compromise\u201d but he understood that Pelosi was at risk of losing the speakership of the House if she went along. \u201cSo we\u2019re in this for the long haul,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Pelosi has all but locked up the support she needs to win the speaker\u2019s gavel Thursday and there has been no sign that she and Schumer are in conflict.\n\n\u201cFor the White House to try and blame anyone but the president for this shutdown doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test,\u201d said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.\n\nPelosi has vowed to pass legislation to reopen the nine shuttered departments and dozens of agencies now hit by the partial shutdown as soon as she takes the gavel, which is expected when the new Congress convenes. But that alone won\u2019t solve the shutdown, absent Senate approval and Trump\u2019s signature.\n\nPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill added that Democrats united against the wall and won\u2019t seriously consider any White House offer unless Trump backs it publicly because he \u201chas changed his position so many times.\u201d\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador reacted cautiously to Trump\u2019s threat to close the border, calling it an \u201cinternal affair of the U.S. government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are always seeking a good relationship with the United States.

Fresh off the passage of the farm bill, which reauthorized agriculture, conservation and safety net programs, the Agriculture Department last week announced a second round of direct payments to growers hardest hit by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nThen parts of the government shut down.\n\nThe USDA in a statement issued last week assured farmers that checks would continue to go out during the first week of the shutdown. But direct payments for farmers who haven\u2019t certified production, as well as farm loans and disaster assistance programs, will be put on hold beginning next week, and won\u2019t start up again until the government reopens.\n\nThere is little chance of the government shutdown ending soon.

Male immigrants were 28 percent less likely to die prematurely from all causes than native-born men, while female immigrants were 25 percent less likely to die prematurely.\n\nThe vast majority of the studies in the analysis focused on migration to high-income countries, not on refugees or asylum seekers. Researchers also excluded studies from their analysis that focused just on migrants with serious or chronic health problems or just on maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\nIt may be, however, that migrants in the study were healthier than people in their native countries who didn't migrate, said Anjali Borhade, director of the Disha Foundation in Gurugram, India, and co-author of an editorial accompanying the study.\n\n\"Educated migrants have better sources of income and being healthy doesn't affect their choice to migrate,\" Borhade said by email. \"Also, educated migrants have better living or working conditions and their health status is similar to the host populations, both for risks as well as outcomes.\"\n\nInfectious disease and homicide deaths may be higher among migrants than other people in the general population because of unfavorable conditions immigrants face at work and in their new communities, Borhade added. That's because many young, relatively healthy migrants may take low-paying and dangerous jobs and only be able to afford housing in subpar conditions.\n\n\"Hazardous jobs and low living conditions increase their risk of dying due to external causes and infectious diseases,\" Borhade said. \"However, since migrants are healthier to begin with, their mortality due to other causes might be lower.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Social Media\u2019s Year of Falling From Grace", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/social-medias-year-of-falling-from-grace/4720871.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Silicon Valley has enjoyed years of popularity and growing markets.\n\nBut 2018 has been rocky for the industry.\n\nData breaches, controversies over offensive speech and misinformation \u2014 as well as reports of foreign operatives\u2019 use of their services \u2014 have left many people skeptical about the benefits of social media, experts say.\n\nWorries about social media in Congress meant tech executives had to testify before committees several times this year.\n\n\u201c2018 has been a challenging year for tech companies and consumers alike,\u201d said Pantas Sutardja, chief executive of LatticeWork Inc., a data storage firm. \u201cCompany CEOs being called to Congress for hearings and promising profusely to fix the problems of data breach but still cannot do it.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Social Media's Year of Falling From Grace\n\nAn apology tour\n\nFacebook drew the most scrutiny.

Not to fight \u2014 not yet, at least \u2014 but to help the men and women who do.\n\nThese robots aren't taking up arms, but the companies making them have waged a different kind of battle. At stake is a contract worth almost half a billion dollars for 3,000 backpack-sized robots that can defuse bombs and scout enemy positions. Competition for the work has spilled over into Congress and federal court.\n\nThe project and others like it could someday help troops \u201clook around the corner, over the next hillside and let the robot be in harm's way and let the robot get shot,\u201d said Paul Scharre, a military technology expert at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nWATCH: US Army Looks for a Few Good Robots, Sparks Industry Battle\n\nThe big fight over small robots opens a window into the intersection of technology and national defense and shows how fear that China could surpass the U.S. drives even small tech startups to play geopolitics to outmaneuver rivals. It also raises questions about whether defense technology should be sourced solely to American companies to avoid the risk of tampering by foreign adversaries.\n\nRegardless of which companies prevail, the competition foreshadows a future in which robots, which are already familiar military tools, become even more common. The Army's immediate plans alone envision a new fleet of 5,000 ground robots of varying sizes and levels of autonomy. The Marines, Navy and Air Force are making similar investments.\n\n\u201cMy personal estimate is that robots will play a significant role in combat inside of a decade or a decade and a half,\u201d the chief of the Army, Gen. Mark Milley, said in May at a Senate hearing where he appealed for more money to modernize the force.\n\nMilley warned that adversaries like China and Russia \u201care investing heavily and very quickly\u201d in the use of aerial, sea and ground robots. And now, he added, \u201cwe are doing the same.\u201d\n\nSuch a shift will be a \u201chuge game-changer for combat,\u201d said Scharre, who credits Milley's leadership for the push.\n\nThe promise of such big Pentagon investments in robotics has been a boon for U.S. defense contractors and technology startups. But the situation is murkier for firms with foreign ties.\n\nConcerns that popular commercial drones made by Chinese company DJI could be vulnerable to spying led the Army to ban their use by soldiers in 2017. And in August, the Pentagon published a report that said China is conducting espionage to acquire foreign military technologies \u2014 sometimes by using students or researchers as \u201cprocurement agents and intermediaries.\u201d At a December defense expo in Egypt, some U.S. firms spotted what they viewed as Chinese knock-offs of their robots.\n\nThe China fears came to a head in a bitter competition between Israeli firm Roboteam and Massachusetts-based Endeavor Robotics over a series of major contracts to build the Army's next generation of ground robots. Those machines will be designed to be smarter and easier to deploy than the remote-controlled rovers that have helped troops disable bombs for more than 15 years.\n\nThe biggest contract \u2014 worth $429 million \u2014 calls for mass producing 25-pound robots that are light, easily maneuverable and can be \u201ccarried by infantry for long distances without taxing the soldier,\u201d said Bryan McVeigh, project manager for force projection at the Army's research and contracting center in Warren, Michigan.\n\nOther bulkier prototypes are tank-sized unmanned supply vehicles that have been tested in recent weeks in the rough and wintry terrain outside Fort Drum, New York.\n\nA third $100 million contract \u2014 won by Endeavor in late 2017 \u2014 is for a midsized reconnaissance and bomb-disabling robot nicknamed the Centaur.\n\nThe competition escalated into a legal fight when Roboteam accused Endeavor, a spinoff of iRobot, which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners, of dooming its prospects for those contracts by hiring a lobbying firm that spread false information to politicians about the Israeli firm's Chinese investors.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Roboteam's lawsuit in April.\n\n\u201cThey alleged that we had somehow defamed them,\u201d said Endeavor CEO Sean Bielat, a former Marine who twice ran for Congress as a Republican. \u201cWhat we had done was taken publicly available documents and presented them to members of Congress because we think there's a reason to be concerned about Chinese influence on defense technologies.\u201d\n\nThe lobbying firm, Boston-based Sachem Strategies, circulated a memo to members of the House Armed Services Committee. Taking up Endeavor's cause was Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat \u2014 and, like Bielat, a Marine veteran \u2014 who wrote a letter to a top military official in December 2016 urging the Army to \u201cexamine the evidence of Chinese influence\u201d before awarding the robot contracts.\n\nSix other lawmakers later raised similar concerns.\n\nRoboteam CEO Elad Levy declined to comment on the dispute but said the firm is still \u201cworking very closely with U.S. forces,\u201d including the Air Force, and other countries. But it's no longer in the running for the lucrative Army opportunities.\n\nEndeavor is. Looking something like a miniature forklift on tank treads, its prototype called the Scorpion has been zipping around a test track behind an office park in a Boston suburb.\n\nThe only other finalist is just 20 miles away at the former Massachusetts headquarters of Foster-Miller, now a part of British defense contractor Qinetiq. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The contract is expected to be awarded in early 2019.\n\nBoth Endeavor and Qinetiq have strong track records with the U.S. military, having supplied it with its earlier generation of ground robots such as Endeavor's Packbot and Qinetiq's Talon and Dragon Runner.\n\nAfter hiding the Scorpion behind a shroud at a recent Army conference, Bielat and engineers at Endeavor showed it for the first time publicly to The Associated Press in November. Using a touchscreen controller that taps into the machine's multiple cameras, an engineer navigated it through tunnels, over a playground-like structure and through an icy pool of water, and used its grabber to pick up objects.\n\nIt's a smaller version of its predecessor, the Packbot, which was first used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2002 and later became one of soldiers' essential tools for safely disabling improvised explosives in Iraq. Bielat said the newer Scorpion and Centaur robots are designed to be easier for the average soldier to use quickly without advanced technical training.\n\n\u201cTheir primary job is to be a rifle squad member,\u201d Bielat said. \u201cThey don't have time to mess with the robot. They're going to demand greater levels of autonomy.\u201d\n\nIt will be a while, however, before any of these robots become fully autonomous. The Defense Department is cautious about developing battlefield machines that make their own decisions. That sets the U.S. apart from efforts by China and Russia to design artificially intelligent warfighting arsenals.\n\nA November report from the Congressional Research Service said that despite the Pentagon's \u201cinsistence\u201d that a human must always be in the loop, the military could soon feel compelled to develop fully autonomous systems if rivals do the same. Or, as with drones, humans will still pull the trigger, but a far-away robot will lob the bombs.\n\nSaid P.W. Singer, a strategist for the New America Foundation think tank: \u201cChina has showed off armed ones. Russia has showed them off. It's coming.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Cybersecurity Law: Vietnam Will Censor Internet, Not Close Websites", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cybersecurity-law-vietnam-will-censor-internet-not-close-websites/4719474.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Expect to get caught if you post anti-government material on the internet in Vietnam or take a phishing trip.

Alternately, they can self-censor, turn over customer profiles and delete certain content, Nguyen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying OK, as an online service provider with Vietnam users, you do collect data about such users and their online activities, but you are letting users use your platform or services for unlawful activities, so please come to the front of the line (so) that we can keep an eye out for you,\u201d said Yee Chung Seck, partner with the Baker McKenzie law firm in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nCatching up in cybersecurity\n\nAccording to a United Nations index, Vietnam ranked 101 out of 165 countries in exposure to cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cVietnam has been historically weak when in it comes to cybersecurity,\u201d cyber intelligence analyst Emilio Iasiello wrote in a commentary for the Cyber Research Databank.\n\nDomestic websites were hit by more than 6,500 malware or phishing attacks in the first eight months of 2018, Viet Nam News reports.\n\nVietnam does not block the websites of foreign internet services that could spread objectionable content. Vietnam, like much of Asia, is trying to develop a digital economy, but unlike China it lacks easy-to-control homegrown alternates to the major Silicon Valley internet firms.\n\n\u201cObviously, the business and user communities are more likely hoping to avoid censorship of the internet outright, due to the growing digital commerce economy and also wanting a platform where freedom of expressions and opinions are allowed,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nA digital economy gives Vietnam an opportunity to resolve \u201cbig issues in its economic development,\u201d the deputy minister of industry and trade was quoted saying in June. The manufacturing-reliant economy has grown 6 to 7 percent per year since 2012.\n\nAbout 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s 92 million people use the internet, with 53 million on social media sites.\n\nProtest from multinational internet content providers\n\nAfter Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly approved the Cybersecurity Law in June, 17 U.S. congressional representatives sent a letter to Google and Facebook. They urged both to avoid storing data in Vietnam, to establish \u201ctransparent guidelines\u201d on content removal and to publish the number of requests for removal.\n\nFacebook, Google and other foreign internet companies said earlier this month via a lobbying group that requirements to localize data would hobble investment and economic growth in Vietnam. The law also requires firms with more than 10,000 local users to set up local representative offices.\n\nFacebook said for this report it \u201cremains committed to its community in Vietnam and in helping Vietnamese businesses grow at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nInternet providers also worry the cybersecurity law gives \u201ctoo much power\u201d to Vietnam\u2019s police ministry and lacks \u201cdue process,\u201d Nguyen said. Authorities, they fear, could \u201cseize customer data\u201d and expose a provider\u2019s users, partners or employees to arrest, which goes against privacy protection policies, he said.\n\n\u200bFear among online activists\n\nVietnam is looking to the cybersecurity law as well to control public criticism of government activity, activist bloggers believe. A string of Vietnamese bloggers was arrested in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAuthorities will be able to collect user names, profiles and data on their friends, media reports and analysts say.\n\n\u201cThis law threatens and further curbs freedom to information, infringes (on) personal privacy, and will be certainly used as a tool to give more power to police force, which violates rights, even on behalf of the court on judging on the use of internet,\u201d Hanoi-based internet blogger and human rights activist Nguyen Lan Thang said.\n\nVietnamese activists leaned heavily on internet media to spread information about what they considered slow government reaction to a mass fish die-off in 2016. They use it now to decry corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Cybersecurity Law will have a huge impact on Vietnam\u2019s dissidents and online activists. It will be a tool to silence dissidents, social commentators, and activists in general,\u201d said Vu Quoc Ngu, a writer in Hanoi and director of the non-profit Defend the Defender.\n\nVu Pham, Michelle Quinn of VOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Amos Oz, Israeli Author, Dead At 79", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amos-oz-dead-cancer-author_us_5c264bd5e4b08aaf7a900acc", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli author Amos Oz, one of the country\u2019s pre-eminent and widely acclaimed writers, died on Friday after a battle with cancer, his family announced.

In 2008, Kelly was acquitted on child pornography charges after a video showed him allegedly having sex with and urinating on a 14-year-old girl. The artist has also agreed to multiple out-of-court settlements with women who accused him of sexual assault, including one who said Kelly had sex with her when she was 15.\n\nLast year Rolling Stone reported that radio DJ Kitti Jones, Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriend, said he abused, sexually assaulted and starved her over their two-year relationship. And a BuzzFeed report accused the singer of holding young women against their will in an abusive sex \u201ccult.\u201d\n\nSince the Me Too movement kicked off last year, and the related Time\u2019s Up initiative called for people to #MuteRKelly, the artist has had some shows canceled. Spotify also stopped promoting his music in playlists and other tools (though the artist\u2019s songs are still available on the platform). And in January, Lifetime plans to release a three-part documentary series detailing the decades of sexual abuse allegations against the singer.\n\nIn July, Kelly released a 19-minute song dismissing accusations of pedophilia and abuse against him.

Julie Swetnick claimed she saw Kavanaugh participate in sexual misconduct at numerous house parties when they were both in high school.\n\nKavanaugh has denied all the allegations.

Teen donors, vampiric undertones, a serious-sounding study, an $8,000-per-person price tag and rumors that venture capitalist Peter Thiel might be interested earned Ambrosia more than 100 press mentions in just two years.\n\nThe effects of young plasma, Karmazin told reporters, were astounding. Just one infusion \u201cdramatically improves people\u2019s appearance, their memory and their strength,\u201d he told one reporter. \u201cI want to be clear, at this point, it works. It reverses aging,\u201d he told another. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality but I think it comes pretty close,\u201d he told a third, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like plastic surgery from the inside out.\u201d\n\nThe free publicity helped Ambrosia attract clients: One hundred and four people paid to receive plasma from 16- to 25-year-old donors as part of Ambrosia\u2019s participant-funded study, Karmazin told HuffPost.\n\nBut despite declaring the study a success and announcing plans this week to accept new clients, Karmazin never showed any proof that the transfusions actually helped people. In the media, he touted impressive results, but almost a year after his study officially concluded in January 2018, he hasn\u2019t released them. Scientists have criticized the study as flawed and the procedure as medically unnecessary and not without risk; in rare cases, transfusion complications can be fatal. One of the doctors Karmazin hired had previously been disciplined by a state medical board for unprofessional conduct. Karmazin himself cannot legally practice medicine in any state; he is explicitly prohibited from practicing in Massachusetts by authorities. Ambrosia\u2019s president and chief operating officer quietly left the company in late December, leaving Karmazin as the sole employee.

But Ambrosia\u2019s ability to attract paying clients and years of positive press coverage \u2014 without providing scientific data to back up its claims \u2014 shows just how easy it can be for promises to outpace the research when Silicon Valley gold-chasing mixes with Americans\u2019 fear of death.\n\n\u201cYou can easily imagine a situation where somebody who\u2019s vulnerable, and not wealthy, and not healthy, and may be desperate ... would potentially feel like they have no option but to spend this money,\u201d said Phuoc Le, a physician and global health specialist who teaches at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThey could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctor Karmazin\n\nKarmazin was born in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and attended Princeton University, where he became a highly accomplished rower, going on to win a silver medal in the Paralympic Games in Beijing in 2008. He attended Stanford Medical School and participated in labs that focused on longevity and stem cell biology. His experience as an athlete \u2014 and feeling slower athletically after turning 30 \u2014 influenced his desire to work on aging as a treatable condition. After graduating in 2014, Karmazin started a residency at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston with a plan to eventually specialize in psychiatry. But as Karmazin tells it, he didn\u2019t like working the long hours and felt he didn\u2019t have time to pursue his other interests, transfusions and aging, in addition to general practice, so he left his residency in 2016 to start Ambrosia.\n\nThere is an asterisk to that story: On Feb. 29, 2016, Karmazin and his attorney signed a voluntary agreement with Massachusetts officials in which he promised to immediately stop practicing medicine in the state. Karmazin told HuffPost he signed the paperwork because he left his residency early, that doing so was \u201cpretty routine,\u201d there were no additional circumstances that he was aware of and that\u2019s all he knew. That account seems unlikely. Karmazin was practicing under a limited license; such a license terminates automatically if a physician leaves a residency program early for any reason, according to George Zachos, the executive director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine. The board wouldn\u2019t typically pursue such an agreement with a limited licensee for leaving a residency early, Zachos said. Such a public agreement is used to protect patient safety. Last year, only 12 physicians in Massachusetts reached similar deals.\n\nThe board\u2019s review is confidential, but a representative noted the circumstances that led to the agreement were unrelated to Karmazin\u2019s work with Ambrosia or xVitality Sciences, a separate \u201crejuvenation\u201d project he also worked on.\n\nKarmazin, who introduces himself as \u201cDr. Karmazin,\u201d moved forward with Ambrosia after signing that agreement. He said he got the idea for young plasma transfusions from several studies in which young and old mice were surgically conjoined in order to examine the effects of mixing their blood. In some cases, the older mice became temporarily stronger and showed slight improvements to their health. Karmazin believed those results could be replicated in humans.\n\nMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood, but there is no scientific evidence for that. Irina Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nScientists have questioned Karmazin\u2019s interpretation of the data. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who led conjoined-mice tests noticed small positive changes in older animals\u2019 muscles, livers and brains. But the more important finding was the significant decline in the health of the younger animals. For the older animals, the young blood was largely diluted by the old blood.\n\n\u201cThere was much more negative effect from the stuff in the old blood than there was positive effect from the stuff in the young blood,\u201d said Irina Conboy, an aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley, who compared young blood transfusions to taking \u201ca pile of rotten bananas\u201d and throwing \u201cone good one\u201d on top. \u201cMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is no scientific evidence for that.\u201d\n\nKarmazin went ahead anyway: In the summer of 2016, he announced that he would charge people ages 35 and older $8,000 each for about 2 liters of young plasma as part of what he called a \u201cclinical trial.\u201d Karmazin didn\u2019t feel the need to go through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug approval process, as plasma transfusions are already a well-established procedure. Most of the time, however, they are used to treat patients who have specific health issues, not carried out to potentially make people feel younger.\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial whipped up the flurry of press coverage that doubled as free advertising, and in some cases, suggested inaccurately that people were drinking young blood. But what really got people talking about Ambrosia was a report that Peter Thiel, the tech entrepreneur billionaire, was interested in young blood. Karmazin himself appears to have made the explicit connection to Ambrosia. In 2016, he told an Inc. magazine reporter that Jason Camm, chief medical officer at Thiel Capital, had contacted him to express interest in Ambrosia. It\u2019s not clear whether Camm was reaching out on Thiel\u2019s behalf, or how extensive the alleged contact was. But the story prompted a wave of Thiel-vampire insinuations in the media. Later, in an interview with TechCrunch, Karmazin completely denied having contact with anyone from Thiel Capital, raising questions about who wanted to quash the story.\n\nCamm and Thiel Capital did not respond to requests for comment. In November, Thiel said at the New York Times DealBook conference: \u201cOn the record. I\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d He also said he\u2019s never injected himself with young blood. Karmazin reiterated to HuffPost that he\u2019s not in any contact with Thiel. When asked why his story appears to have changed, Karmazin repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nSweet Little 16-Year-Old Plasma\n\nTo launch his study, Karmazin needed plasma, the liquid part of blood, from young people. He needed a lot of it \u2014 Ambrosia performed more than 150 roughly 2-liter transfusions (some clients reportedly returned for multiple treatments), according to Karmazin, which would have required at least 80 gallons of young plasma, hundreds of donations\u2019 worth. But he faced a hitch: Blood banks don\u2019t typically separate out blood plasma by age and sell it for rejuvenation purposes; their primary mission is to provide donated blood for hospital patients and save lives.\n\nWhen blood centers have unused plasma, they commonly provide it to different companies in order to make products to treat serious medical conditions such as hemophilia, according to a spokesperson for AABB, a nonprofit that accredits blood centers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to find a blood bank willing to supply a startup for Karmazin\u2019s purposes. In the beginning, Karmazin called some 20 blood banks, he said. It \u201ctook a while to find the right partner,\u201d he added. There was interest, he claimed, but banks didn\u2019t have a process in place to get him the plasma he needed. HuffPost contacted more than a dozen U.S. blood banks, many of which cited ethical concerns and raised questions about Ambrosia\u2019s study. The chief medical and scientific officer of Vitalant, a nonprofit that distributes blood to more than 1,000 U.S. hospitals, told HuffPost that Vitalant leadership contacted all its donation centers after hearing about Ambrosia to confirm none worked with the company. Ambrosia\u2019s study didn\u2019t seem to be a legitimate clinical trial, Dr. Ralph Vassallo said, so Vitalant shouldn\u2019t be selling to the startup.\n\nEventually, Karmazin said, he found two blood banks to provide the company with \u201cexcess\u201d young plasma that he could use for his study. Karmazin refused to say which ones they were.\n\nEmmanuel Polanco for HuffPost\n\nDeep In The Heart Of Texas\n\nOne of his partners for Ambrosia\u2019s trial was the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a subsidiary of BioBridge Global, a nonprofit headquartered in San Antonio.\n\nSTBTC has lamented \u201ccritical\u201d blood supply shortages and called on millennials to \u201cstep up and donate.\u201d It has sent blood collection buses to schools and asks students on its website: \u201cAre you up for saving lives?\u201d It holds a donation competition for local high schools called \u201cGeneration Give\u201d with $750 top prizes, and has offered incentives to donors such as free movie tickets and amusement park passes. Students who have donated six blood products or more \u201chave made the difference in the lives of over 18 hospital patients,\u201d STBTC states on its website. Honored students receive a special red cord to wear at their high school graduation ceremony.\n\nThe South Texas blood bank\u2019s main mission is to provide blood to approximately 100 hospitals and clinics, Elizabeth Waltman, STBTC\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. But \u201cafter community needs are met, and to ensure no donated blood is wasted, we provide blood where it is needed, including to support research that will advance medical care,\u201d she added. Ambrosia\u2019s study met STBTC\u2019s requirements for research-related use of their blood components, she said.\n\nSTBTC did not comment on whether it sold donations that came through Generation Give as young plasma. But its consent forms for blood donors \u201cclearly state\u201d that donations will be used to serve \u201cboth clinical and research purposes,\u201d Waltman said. HuffPost reviewed a copy of STBTC\u2019s 1,200-word student consent form, which requires kids and parents to acknowledge that donated blood may be used to help patients \u201cor for any other medical purpose.\u201d The form praises students for \u201cgiving the gift of life.\u201d\n\nThe Trial\n\nBy the fall of 2016, Karmazin was ready to launch his study.\n\nAmbrosia told trial participants that \u201cabundant data\u201d from mice studies suggested young plasma infusions could help with \u201crejuvenation,\u201d but the company said it couldn\u2019t guarantee participants any specific results, such as the treatment of a disease. Rather, it noted in its informed consent form that there are \u201cno known improvements\u201d directly related to young plasma infusions. In fact, the form contained \u201can appalling lack of detailed explanation of what the actual effects of this intervention are supposed to be,\u201d said Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who reviewed Ambrosia\u2019s form at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\nKarmazin contracted physicians to carry out the young plasma transfusions at clinics in San Francisco; Monterey, California; and Tampa, Florida. The Monterey-based doctor, David Wright, had been publicly reprimanded by the Medical Board of California in 2015 for charges that included gross negligence related to diagnosing a patient with a chronic tick-borne infection without an adequate basis, and then using a medically unsupported treatment \u2015 daily antibiotic infusion therapy \u2015 that led to significant side effects. Wright did not admit to wrongdoing in the agreement; the reprimand did not preclude him from practicing medicine.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said one director of transfusion medicine. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm.\u201d\n\nThen-New Scientist writer Sally Adee traveled to Monterey to cover Ambrosia\u2019s trial in 2017 and reported that a patient who came from Russia had an anaphylactic reaction after a transfusion. Wright was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d after the incident, Adee wrote.\n\nAmbrosia ultimately reported four adverse incidents during the trial, according to Barbara Krutchkoff, the executive director of the Institute of Regenerative and Cellular Medicine, a small nonprofit that houses an institutional review board that oversaw the study. They included a rash in March 2017, a runny nose and cold symptoms in April, hives and edema in June, and itchiness in December. All were considered mild allergic reactions and resolved, she said.\n\nAmbrosia was fortunate there weren\u2019t more adverse reactions, said Le, the physician and global health specialist.\n\n\u201cIn general, somebody who does not need a blood transfusion would be at great risk for all sorts of things, short term and long term,\u201d said Le, who was alarmed that Ambrosia claimed to give patients about 2 liters of plasma over just one to two days.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said Robertson Davenport, director of transfusion medicine at the University of Michigan. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the study, Karmazin and Wright had a falling-out. They disagreed over Karmazin\u2019s plans to transfuse smaller amounts of young plasma over a shorter period of time \u2014 a change Wright deemed risky, according to the New Scientist article. \u201cWe just had different ideas for what this treatment could become,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. Wright stopped working for Ambrosia before the study was complete.\n\nWright did not respond to several calls and emailed requests for comment. When HuffPost sent a reporter to his new office in Pacific Grove, his receptionist threatened to call the police.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s Still No Data\u2019\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial formally ended in January 2018. It was a great success, according to Karmazin, with about one-third of the participants returning to purchase additional treatments and around 150 treatments delivered in all. Some people continued to receive transfusions as late as this past summer, he said.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Ambrosia had been touting findings for months. Karmazin claimed to Canada\u2019s National Post, for example, that an early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patient showed improvements with one treatment and a person in their 60s saw their graying hair turn darker. He told New Scientist that he saw a 10 percent decrease in patients\u2019 blood cholesterol levels, and told Boss Magazine there were \u201creally dramatic improvements\u201d to biomarkers for inflammation.\n\n[Ambrosia] seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money. Michael Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nThe company said it tested patients\u2019 blood for more than 100 biomarkers before and after the transfusions, looking for improvements in markers for aging and disease. Ambrosia\u2019s study did not have a control group that received a placebo. And a change in a biomarker isn\u2019t necessarily proof of a change in actual health status, noted Charo, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor. Such changes must be matched to \u201creal health outcomes,\u201d which requires long-term follow-up. Karmazin said patients wrote diaries, and that some later volunteered additional health data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how Ambrosia\u2019s was set up as a clinical trial,\u201d said Michael Conboy, husband and research partner of Irina Conboy, the aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley. \u201cIt seemed to me that it was set up as more of a \u2018fee for service\u2019 type thing and the \u2018trial\u2019 part was slapped on to legitimize it. It seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still no public data. Karmazin shared some \u201cpreliminary results that he was excited about\u201d with his hired institutional review board, Krutchkoff said, but she hadn\u2019t seen the final results. Speaking to HuffPost with Karmazin\u2019s permission, Krutchkoff praised Karmazin\u2019s professionalism and brushed off criticisms of the study. \u201cAs controversial as this study was, there\u2019s a lot worse being done,\u201d she said.\n\nHoward Chipman, the doctor Ambrosia hired in Tampa, also said he hadn\u2019t seen the results. HuffPost could not find a participant who had.\n\nTom Casey, the CEO of NuPlasma, a company that sells young plasma to physicians in Texas \u2015 and is supplying another young plasma study in Houston \u2014 urged Karmazin to release the data. \u201cThe people who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you called this a trial and said you were collecting data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still no data.\u201d\n\nResults Not Guaranteed\n\nKarmazin and David Cavalier, Ambrosia\u2019s then-president and chief operating officer, said earlier this past fall that they had to be careful not to make any guarantees about the effects of Ambrosia\u2019s treatment. Companies generally need to get approval from the FDA before they can claim that a drug or medical product treats, cures or prevents a disease. Cavalier noted that Ambrosia transfused a Parkinson\u2019s patient who reported an improvement in a tremor, a patient with depleted testosterone levels who was soon \u201cenjoying morning erections again,\u201d and people who reported improvements with arthritis symptoms, sleep, memory and energy levels.\n\nSome of Ambrosia\u2019s claims to the media have been \u201cmaybe a little bit exuberant\u201d but still \u201c100 percent accurate,\u201d Karmazin said.\n\nKarmazin told HuffPost in the fall he temporarily paused transfusions to focus on opening a clinic in New York City by early 2019. Ambrosia is required to obtain a permit to transfuse a blood component in New York, but as of mid-December, the company had not applied for one, according to a New York State Department of Health spokesperson.\n\nHe initially claimed he planned to publish the findings of Ambrosia\u2019s study in a peer-reviewed journal after its clinic was open. He announced this week on his website that Ambrosia is scheduling clients again in San Francisco and Tampa. He brought back two doctors he worked with during the study, he told HuffPost. He said this week that he still hadn\u2019t submitted any data for peer review \u2014 a process that can take months. He was \u201ceager to do so,\u201d but didn\u2019t know precisely when he would.\n\nCavalier quietly left the company this week, right before Ambrosia announced it was offering treatments again. He would not comment on the circumstances of his exit, but noted in an email that he was only with the company for \u201ca very brief period.\u201d Karmazin declined to comment further on Cavalier\u2019s departure.\n\nAnd at least one of Ambrosia\u2019s blood bank partners no longer sells young plasma. Shortly after HuffPost reached out to the South Texas blood bank in October, it abruptly halted all sales of young plasma products, according to an employee email chain HuffPost obtained.\n\n\u201cWe have had a few developments internally due to some negative press,\u201d an employee wrote on Oct. 22. Waltman, the STBTC executive, told HuffPost the bank would not supply Ambrosia with plasma for a clinic rollout because doing so would interfere with their ability to fulfill local needs. The HuffPost inquiry had no bearing on that issue, she added.\n\nFor all its press coverage, Ambrosia did not have any investors as of April 2017, Karmazin said; in September 2018, Karmazin told HuffPost that Ambrosia hadn\u2019t yet raised any money. That same month, he advertised on his LinkedIn page that the company was looking for $3 million to open its first clinic. By November, Karmazin said the LinkedIn posts had been removed because the company had garnered a \u201clarge amount of interest,\u201d but Ambrosia would not comment on whether it had any investors.\n\nDespite Karmazin\u2019s insistence that many people are excited about the treatment, over the course of reporting this story, Ambrosia declined to put HuffPost in touch with a single patient. Initially, Karmazin said the patients are protective of their privacy and \u201cafter the hundredth reporter asked to talk, people were just getting a little tired of answering the same questions.\u201d After HuffPost noted that it could find only one trial participant who had spoken to the press, Karmazin said that in the beginning, he had asked about 10 to 15 patients if they wanted to speak to reporters, but they all declined.\n\nIt appears the only participant in Ambrosia\u2019s trial who spoke to the press was a man from Georgia. He told a German newspaper that he was one of Ambrosia\u2019s first patients and had perhaps received \u201cmore blood plasma than anyone else in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia man was \u201cthe most excited person about this treatment,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. He died after going into cardiac arrest in February 2018 at the age of 65.\n\nYoung plasma \u201cisn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d the man told New Scientist last year. But he had hoped he could \u201cjust get 10 more healthy years of living.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s family did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the circumstances of his death, and a doctor familiar with his case declined to comment without a family member\u2019s permission. Karmazin said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment. It is unclear when the man received his final treatment with Ambrosia.\n\nThese days, Karmazin won\u2019t even publicly admit whether he has tried the treatment Ambrosia is hawking. He told one news outlet in June 2017 he hadn\u2019t, claiming he was waiting until he\u2019d be \u201cold enough\u201d at 35. In a separate interview in December 2017, when he was still not yet 35, he said he\u2019d tried it \u201ca few times\u201d and it felt \u201cpretty phenomenal.\u201d Speaking to HuffPost, he refused to comment, citing privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to confirm that I\u2019ve done it for the purposes of this interview,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, spending $8,000 on a young plasma transfusion is a \u201creally good use of people\u2019s health care dollars,\u201d Karmazin said. Those with certain diseases \u201cshould be getting treatment right away,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to be treating as many people as possible.\u201d\n\nThis week, Karmazin announced Ambrosia has lowered its age limit and raised its prices. People as young as 30 are now eligible for treatment. And two liters of young plasma costs $12,000.\n\nGot tips?

It was also full of embarrassing assertions about the president\u2019s private life: that his mysterious hairdo is the result of a scalp reduction surgery, that he eats so much McDonald\u2019s because he\u2019s worried about being poisoned and that he\u2019s only \u201csemi-literate.\u201d\n\nMany more tell-alls followed, including a book from adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2015 who outlined the salacious details of her alleged affair with Trump and made her now-infamous remark about his penis (more on that below).\n\nMichelle Wolf\u2019s Set At The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images Trump declared comedian Michelle Wolf's set \"a total disaster.\"\n\nFor some reason, Trump didn\u2019t like having comedians tear into him and all his friends at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April.\n\nThe president wasn\u2019t actually in the room when Michelle Wolf roasted members of the Trump administration (and some Democrats and media outlets, too.)

The judge\u2019s decision came after the Knight First Amendment Institute filed a lawsuit against Trump and his communications team, arguing that the president, who regularly uses Twitter to announce major policy decisions, was violating people\u2019s First Amendment rights when he blocked them on the platform. The suit was filed on behalf of seven Twitter users whom Trump had blocked on the platform. Other well-known people blocked from his account included author Stephen King, actor Rosie O\u2019Donnell and model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen.\n\nThat Trump Balloon\n\nZAKARIA ABDELKAFI via Getty Images A balloon Trump wearing a diaper flies overhead as people protest at the Place de la Republique in central Paris on Nov. 11, 2018.\n\nThe president of the United States probably didn\u2019t love being depicted as a giant, diaper-clad baby in balloon form.

But we\u2019d argue that the real victim here is Toad, who previously was known only for being a friendly Mushroom Kingdom resident and loyal buddy to Mario.\n\nGetting Laughed At By The United Nations General Assembly\n\nXinhua News Agency via Getty Images Trump reacts as the audience laughs during his speech at the General Debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 25, 2018.\n\nThere are a lot of things that come with the territory of being president that Trump is reportedly not excited about, like reading memos. But as his many rallies demonstrate, there\u2019s one thing he clearly loves about the job: speaking to crowds of admiring supporters.\n\nIf the president was expecting a similarly enthusiastic reception at the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was surely disappointed.\n\n\u201cIn less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country ... So true,\u201d Trump said. The characteristic boast elicited a muffled laugh from the crowd of world leaders.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that reaction but that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said, chuckling along as the crowd erupted with more laughter.\n\nHe later told reporters that his speech was totally, 100 percent intended to make the UN assembly laugh.\n\nLosing A Bet Against Elizabeth Warren Over Her Ancestry\n\nYuri Gripas/Reuters Trump apparently didn't see that one coming.\n\nTrump had long mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for claiming Native American heritage and once promised to donate $1 million to charity if she could prove it. And then Warren did.\n\nIn October, the Democrat made public the results of a DNA test that an expert said showed \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that she has a Native American ancestor. Many Native American groups found the move offensive, and Warren later clarified that she respected the distinction between DNA and tribal affiliation.\n\nBut she also took the opportunity to remind the president of his promise. She asked Trump to donate the $1 million to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, a nonprofit that seeks to protect Native American women from violence. She also pointed out that Trump still hasn\u2019t released his tax returns. \u201cWhat are YOU hiding?\u201d she tweeted at him.\n\nTrump responded both by denying his earlier donation promise and saying he\u2019d only give to charity if he could test Warren personally.\n\nHaving To Return Jim Acosta\u2019s Press Credentials\n\nOf all the media outlets the president has disparaged over the years, there is perhaps none he seems to despise as much as CNN.\n\nFor that reason, it probably gave him great pleasure when the White House revoked CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass after a press conference on Nov. 7. Acosta and Trump had a heated exchange that resulted in a White House intern grabbing the microphone out of the reporter\u2019s hands. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was later accused of sharing a doctored video of the incident to defend the administration\u2019s decision to revoke Acosta\u2019s press credentials.\n\nYou manipulated this video. The lies never end. Here\u2019s the actual video. pic.twitter.com/pdVWbDOKTI \u2014 Matt Dornic (@mdornic) November 8, 2018\n\nCNN sued the Trump administration for violating the First Amendment rights of both the network and Acosta. And much to the president\u2019s likely chagrin, the White House returned Acosta\u2019s press pass.\n\n\u2018Terrific\u2019 Taylor Swift Burning Republicans\n\nTrump was so miffed by pop star Taylor Swift breaking her political silence to endorse a Democrat that he gave reporters a percentage of just how irritated he was.\n\nTaylor Hill via Getty Images Trump apparently likes Taylor Swift's music 25 percent less now...\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say that I like Taylor\u2019s music about 25 percent less now, OK?\u201d Trump told reporters before walking into the White House in October. The comment came the day after Swift, long criticized for her silence on political issues, endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate and condemned his opponent, Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, over her stance on women\u2019s and LGBTQ issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Taylor Swift doesn\u2019t know anything about her,\u201d Trump said of Blackburn, whom he stumped for on the campaign trail.\n\nSwift\u2019s burn must have stung, given the praise Trump gave her when he was but a celebrity hotelier.\n\n\u201cGlad to hear that [Swift] will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5,\u201d Trump tweeted back in 2012. \u201cTaylor is terrific!\u201d\n\nMusicians Telling Him He Can\u2019t Play Their Songs At Rallies\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP Rihanna shut it down.\n\nTrump has a history of being spurned by musicians for using their songs at his events, and that trend continued into 2018.\n\nRihanna shut it down pretty quickly after she found out the president was playing her 2007 hit \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d at a Chattanooga rally for Blackburn, the aforementioned Senate candidate.\n\n\u201c[M]e nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies,\u201d she tweeted when she found out about the song\u2019s usage, vowing to stop Trump from continuing to play it. She later sent him a cease and desist letter.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one. Trump also received complaints from Pharrell Williams, Guns N\u2019 Roses and Neil Young this year for playing their music at his rallies.\n\nIvanka\u2019s Alleged Misuse Of A Personal Email Account\n\nMark Wilson via Getty Images No shouts of \"Lock her up!\" from Trump this time.\n\nWhen The Washington Post reported in November that Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, had allegedly used a personal account to send hundreds of emails last year related to government business, Trump could no longer bash Hillary Clinton over her private email server without looking like a total hypocrite.\n\nAccording to insiders who spoke with the Post, Ivanka Trump was \u201cthe worst offender in the White House\u201d when it came to possibly violating the Presidential Records Act, which mandates that all official White House communications and records be preserved in a permanent archive. Perhaps more concerning, the sources said, her use of a private email server could increase the risk of hackers obtaining sensitive government information.\n\nThat was especially inconvenient news for her dad, who made Clinton\u2019s misuse of a private email server the focal point of his campaign and encouraged \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants at his rallies regarding her email usage. At the rally he headlined in Tupelo, Mississippi, several days after the Post\u2019s story, he uncharacteristically avoided bringing up Clinton.\n\nFox News Accidentally Calling Him \u2018David Trump\u2019\n\nIt was probably funny to everyone but Trump when his favorite news channel bungled his name on live television.

She is charged with endangering the health or life of a child and involuntary manslaughter, the Post-Dispatch said.\n\nProsecutors said they did not yet know the motive.\n\nAn investigation by KSDK indicated that the girl\u2019s Type I diabetes was diagnosed twice and that her mother was informed both times.\n\nWhile the condition is treatable, Dr. George Thampy, an endocrinologist, told KSDK that substantial care must be given.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a spiraling condition that could lead to coma or death, if not treated immediately, especially in a child,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Nov. 1, first responders were called to Emily Hampshire\u2019s home, where she lived with her brother and parents, the Post-Dispatch reported.

It was also full of embarrassing assertions about the president\u2019s private life: that his mysterious hairdo is the result of a scalp reduction surgery, that he eats so much McDonald\u2019s because he\u2019s worried about being poisoned and that he\u2019s only \u201csemi-literate.\u201d\n\nMany more tell-alls followed, including a book from adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2015 who outlined the salacious details of her alleged affair with Trump and made her now-infamous remark about his penis (more on that below).\n\nMichelle Wolf\u2019s Set At The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images Trump declared comedian Michelle Wolf's set \"a total disaster.\"\n\nFor some reason, Trump didn\u2019t like having comedians tear into him and all his friends at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April.\n\nThe president wasn\u2019t actually in the room when Michelle Wolf roasted members of the Trump administration (and some Democrats and media outlets, too.)

The judge\u2019s decision came after the Knight First Amendment Institute filed a lawsuit against Trump and his communications team, arguing that the president, who regularly uses Twitter to announce major policy decisions, was violating people\u2019s First Amendment rights when he blocked them on the platform. The suit was filed on behalf of seven Twitter users whom Trump had blocked on the platform.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2018\n\n\u201cThis struck me as like an angry eighth-grader\u2019s tweet,\u201d Costello said on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to make sense of it because I don\u2019t think he can do this even if he wanted to. It probably violates NAFTA. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have much if any support in Congress. Nor do I think logistically he\u2019d be able to implement it.\n\n\u201cAnd when you start throwing out vacuous threats like this, people stop taking you seriously in terms of how you go about negotiating.\u201d\n\nCostello, who announced in May that he would not run for re-election, tweeted earlier this month that Trump\u2019s political pressure on the Democrats just as they are about to take control of the House was \u201ctoddler logic.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump is blaming the Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, he was the one who refused to sign a temporary spending measure until he gets billions of dollars for his border wall, a signature campaign promise. He said earlier this month he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government for \u201cborder security.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, the president said that this is his shutdown,\u201d Costello said. Now it\u2019s not \u201cclear on what amount of money he needs in order to sign a funding bill,\u201d he added. \u201cThe ball\u2019s in the president\u2019s court, and we have no clarity on what he\u2019s willing to accept or what he might sign.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "2-Year-Old Yemeni Boy Whose Mom Sued U.S. To See Him Has Died", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2-year-old-yemeni-boy-whose-mom-sued-us-to-see-him-has-died_us_5c27882ee4b0407e90831f7a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "OAKLAND, Calif.

He and his wife Shaima Swileh moved to Egypt after marrying in war-torn Yemen in 2016. Swileh is not an American citizen and remained in Egypt while fighting for a visa.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken. We had to say goodbye to our baby, the light of our lives,\u201d Ali Hassan was quoted as saying in the statement published by the council.\n\nSwileh held her son for the first time in the hospital 10 days ago.\n\nA funeral is scheduled for Saturday.\n\nCouncil on American-Islamic Relations via AP This recent undated photo shows Ali Hassan with his dying 2-year-old son Abdullah in a Sacramento hospital.\n\nSwileh had been trying to get a visa since 2017, so the family could move to the United States.\n\nCitizens from Yemen and four other mostly Muslim countries, along with North Korea and Venezuela, are restricted from coming to the United States under President Donald Trump\u2019 s travel ban.\n\nWhen the boy\u2019s health worsened, the father went ahead to California in October to get their son help, and Swileh remained in Egypt hoping for a visa. As the couple fought for a waiver, doctors put Abdullah on life support.\n\n\u201cMy wife is calling me every day wanting to kiss and hold her son for the one last time,\u201d AliHassan said, choking up at a news conference earlier this month.\n\nHe started losing hope and was considering pulling his son off life support to end his suffering.

Their creations line the walls of the art and electives room. In the adjacent hallway, bright blue plywood covers the spots where students punched or kicked holes in the drywall as they passed between classes.\n\nThis is the middle school campus for the New Orleans Center for Resilience, a nonprofit K\u20138 school with two locations in the city. The 27 kids enrolled in the center\u2019s program have some of the most extreme behavior needs in the city, often stemming from trauma or mental illness. A typical student may have exhibited verbal and physical aggression, caused property damage or refused to do classwork. It\u2019s a place for kids who have almost nowhere else to turn \u2014 when they\u2019ve been asked or told to leave their previous schools.\n\n\u201cA lot of the kids who are referred here have experienced significant complex trauma,\u201d said Liz Marcell Williams, the center\u2019s director. \u201cWhether they themselves have been victims of trauma or they\u2019re exposed to violence in the home or in the community or have experienced significant loss of a loved one due to long-term incarceration or death.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans, a high-poverty, high-crime city, has particularly pressing needs when it comes to trauma and behavioral health.\n\nA survey of about 1,200 New Orleans kids ages 10 to 16, released in 2015, found that nearly 40 percent had witnessed domestic violence, a shooting, a stabbing or a beating. About 18 percent reported witnessing a murder. And more than half said that someone close to them had been murdered.\n\nThe survey found that children in New Orleans displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at more than three times the national average.\n\nThe center, which was known as the Therapeutic Day Program until Dec. 1, is a rare lifeline to the few who get in. When it opened in 2015, it was the first school of its kind in New Orleans, offering a blend of traditional classes like math and English, as well as therapy and counseling. In a city where student mental health resources remain scant, there are few places like it today.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Misty Johnson does a warm-up activity with Jordan Coughlin, a math teacher at the Center for Resilience.\n\nKids who arrive at the center are usually three grade levels behind in math and reading, said Williams, who has a background in special education and designed the school\u2019s curriculum. Her goal is to get kids back into the mainstream school system. Students attend the center for an average of 15 months.\n\nNine-year-old Misty Johnson, who has ADHD and bipolar disorder, has been in the program for two years. Her mom, Dawn Johnson, said Misty is almost ready to return to a charter elementary school.\n\nJohnson admitted that she was worried when she first visited the center. \u201cThe other kids were just like Misty,\u201d she said, adding that she thought it might be overwhelming for her daughter.\n\nOver time, however, she saw improvements in Misty\u2019s behavior and academics. Many of the classes here are tiny; some have just two students. Misty was getting lots of one-on-one attention. The school called Johnson regularly to give updates.\n\nThis year the center started assigning students a home base room, where they begin their day with breakfast. The home base is meant to be a safe room, and students may return there during the day if they need to opt out of a class or activity. In a typical school, students don\u2019t usually have the option to walk out of class if they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Abel Thompson, a second-grader, displays his newly crafted Santa Claus beard. In addition to academic offerings, various activities \u2014 from sports to play to art \u2014 are integrated into a school day at the Center for Resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always thinking about how do we minimize power struggles,\u201d Williams said. The home base room really helped them with that, she added. From August to November last year, the center had 235 behavioral incidents requiring an adult crisis response, she said. This year in the same time frame, there were 77. The home base rooms were partly responsible for that, she said.\n\nDespite the high rate of turnover at the center, most kids who apply for a spot at the tiny school never get in.\n\nOnly 45 kids have attended since the school opened. Erin LaFleur wanted her 14-year-old son, Brady, to be one of them. He has bipolar disorder, autism and Down syndrome and spent time in a state-run facility that was several hours away by car.

Teen donors, vampiric undertones, a serious-sounding study, an $8,000-per-person price tag and rumors that venture capitalist Peter Thiel might be interested earned Ambrosia more than 100 press mentions in just two years.\n\nThe effects of young plasma, Karmazin told reporters, were astounding. Just one infusion \u201cdramatically improves people\u2019s appearance, their memory and their strength,\u201d he told one reporter. \u201cI want to be clear, at this point, it works. It reverses aging,\u201d he told another. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality but I think it comes pretty close,\u201d he told a third, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like plastic surgery from the inside out.\u201d\n\nThe free publicity helped Ambrosia attract clients: One hundred and four people paid to receive plasma from 16- to 25-year-old donors as part of Ambrosia\u2019s participant-funded study, Karmazin told HuffPost.\n\nBut despite declaring the study a success and announcing plans this week to accept new clients, Karmazin never showed any proof that the transfusions actually helped people. In the media, he touted impressive results, but almost a year after his study officially concluded in January 2018, he hasn\u2019t released them. Scientists have criticized the study as flawed and the procedure as medically unnecessary and not without risk; in rare cases, transfusion complications can be fatal. One of the doctors Karmazin hired had previously been disciplined by a state medical board for unprofessional conduct. Karmazin himself cannot legally practice medicine in any state; he is explicitly prohibited from practicing in Massachusetts by authorities. Ambrosia\u2019s president and chief operating officer quietly left the company in late December, leaving Karmazin as the sole employee. And the only patient who spoke publicly about Ambrosia\u2019s transfusions \u2014 treatments he hoped would help him live healthier into old age \u2014 died at 65 after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nKarmazin couldn\u2019t comment on individual patients but said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment.\n\n[People] could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment. Phuoc Le, physician and global health specialist\n\nHuffPost found that at least some of Karmazin\u2019s young plasma came from a nonprofit blood bank in Texas that recruited teenage donors for \u201csaving lives,\u201d but noted on a consent form that their blood components could also be used for \u201cany other medical purpose.\u201d\n\nThe bank abruptly decided to stop selling young plasma after HuffPost reached out, according to an employee email.\n\nAmbrosia, which declined to comment on whether the company has any investors, is only one of many firms investigating how to help people feel younger for longer. But Ambrosia\u2019s ability to attract paying clients and years of positive press coverage \u2014 without providing scientific data to back up its claims \u2014 shows just how easy it can be for promises to outpace the research when Silicon Valley gold-chasing mixes with Americans\u2019 fear of death.\n\n\u201cYou can easily imagine a situation where somebody who\u2019s vulnerable, and not wealthy, and not healthy, and may be desperate ... would potentially feel like they have no option but to spend this money,\u201d said Phuoc Le, a physician and global health specialist who teaches at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThey could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctor Karmazin\n\nKarmazin was born in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and attended Princeton University, where he became a highly accomplished rower, going on to win a silver medal in the Paralympic Games in Beijing in 2008. He attended Stanford Medical School and participated in labs that focused on longevity and stem cell biology. His experience as an athlete \u2014 and feeling slower athletically after turning 30 \u2014 influenced his desire to work on aging as a treatable condition. After graduating in 2014, Karmazin started a residency at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston with a plan to eventually specialize in psychiatry. But as Karmazin tells it, he didn\u2019t like working the long hours and felt he didn\u2019t have time to pursue his other interests, transfusions and aging, in addition to general practice, so he left his residency in 2016 to start Ambrosia.\n\nThere is an asterisk to that story: On Feb. 29, 2016, Karmazin and his attorney signed a voluntary agreement with Massachusetts officials in which he promised to immediately stop practicing medicine in the state. Karmazin told HuffPost he signed the paperwork because he left his residency early, that doing so was \u201cpretty routine,\u201d there were no additional circumstances that he was aware of and that\u2019s all he knew. That account seems unlikely. Karmazin was practicing under a limited license; such a license terminates automatically if a physician leaves a residency program early for any reason, according to George Zachos, the executive director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine. The board wouldn\u2019t typically pursue such an agreement with a limited licensee for leaving a residency early, Zachos said. Such a public agreement is used to protect patient safety. Last year, only 12 physicians in Massachusetts reached similar deals.\n\nThe board\u2019s review is confidential, but a representative noted the circumstances that led to the agreement were unrelated to Karmazin\u2019s work with Ambrosia or xVitality Sciences, a separate \u201crejuvenation\u201d project he also worked on.\n\nKarmazin, who introduces himself as \u201cDr. Karmazin,\u201d moved forward with Ambrosia after signing that agreement. He said he got the idea for young plasma transfusions from several studies in which young and old mice were surgically conjoined in order to examine the effects of mixing their blood. In some cases, the older mice became temporarily stronger and showed slight improvements to their health. Karmazin believed those results could be replicated in humans.\n\nMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood, but there is no scientific evidence for that. Irina Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nScientists have questioned Karmazin\u2019s interpretation of the data. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who led conjoined-mice tests noticed small positive changes in older animals\u2019 muscles, livers and brains. But the more important finding was the significant decline in the health of the younger animals. For the older animals, the young blood was largely diluted by the old blood.\n\n\u201cThere was much more negative effect from the stuff in the old blood than there was positive effect from the stuff in the young blood,\u201d said Irina Conboy, an aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley, who compared young blood transfusions to taking \u201ca pile of rotten bananas\u201d and throwing \u201cone good one\u201d on top. \u201cMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is no scientific evidence for that.\u201d\n\nKarmazin went ahead anyway: In the summer of 2016, he announced that he would charge people ages 35 and older $8,000 each for about 2 liters of young plasma as part of what he called a \u201cclinical trial.\u201d Karmazin didn\u2019t feel the need to go through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug approval process, as plasma transfusions are already a well-established procedure. Most of the time, however, they are used to treat patients who have specific health issues, not carried out to potentially make people feel younger.\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial whipped up the flurry of press coverage that doubled as free advertising, and in some cases, suggested inaccurately that people were drinking young blood. But what really got people talking about Ambrosia was a report that Peter Thiel, the tech entrepreneur billionaire, was interested in young blood. Karmazin himself appears to have made the explicit connection to Ambrosia. In 2016, he told an Inc. magazine reporter that Jason Camm, chief medical officer at Thiel Capital, had contacted him to express interest in Ambrosia. It\u2019s not clear whether Camm was reaching out on Thiel\u2019s behalf, or how extensive the alleged contact was. But the story prompted a wave of Thiel-vampire insinuations in the media. Later, in an interview with TechCrunch, Karmazin completely denied having contact with anyone from Thiel Capital, raising questions about who wanted to quash the story.\n\nCamm and Thiel Capital did not respond to requests for comment. In November, Thiel said at the New York Times DealBook conference: \u201cOn the record. I\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d He also said he\u2019s never injected himself with young blood. Karmazin reiterated to HuffPost that he\u2019s not in any contact with Thiel. When asked why his story appears to have changed, Karmazin repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nSweet Little 16-Year-Old Plasma\n\nTo launch his study, Karmazin needed plasma, the liquid part of blood, from young people. He needed a lot of it \u2014 Ambrosia performed more than 150 roughly 2-liter transfusions (some clients reportedly returned for multiple treatments), according to Karmazin, which would have required at least 80 gallons of young plasma, hundreds of donations\u2019 worth. But he faced a hitch: Blood banks don\u2019t typically separate out blood plasma by age and sell it for rejuvenation purposes; their primary mission is to provide donated blood for hospital patients and save lives.\n\nWhen blood centers have unused plasma, they commonly provide it to different companies in order to make products to treat serious medical conditions such as hemophilia, according to a spokesperson for AABB, a nonprofit that accredits blood centers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to find a blood bank willing to supply a startup for Karmazin\u2019s purposes. In the beginning, Karmazin called some 20 blood banks, he said. It \u201ctook a while to find the right partner,\u201d he added. There was interest, he claimed, but banks didn\u2019t have a process in place to get him the plasma he needed. HuffPost contacted more than a dozen U.S. blood banks, many of which cited ethical concerns and raised questions about Ambrosia\u2019s study. The chief medical and scientific officer of Vitalant, a nonprofit that distributes blood to more than 1,000 U.S. hospitals, told HuffPost that Vitalant leadership contacted all its donation centers after hearing about Ambrosia to confirm none worked with the company. Ambrosia\u2019s study didn\u2019t seem to be a legitimate clinical trial, Dr. Ralph Vassallo said, so Vitalant shouldn\u2019t be selling to the startup.\n\nEventually, Karmazin said, he found two blood banks to provide the company with \u201cexcess\u201d young plasma that he could use for his study. Karmazin refused to say which ones they were.\n\nEmmanuel Polanco for HuffPost\n\nDeep In The Heart Of Texas\n\nOne of his partners for Ambrosia\u2019s trial was the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a subsidiary of BioBridge Global, a nonprofit headquartered in San Antonio.\n\nSTBTC has lamented \u201ccritical\u201d blood supply shortages and called on millennials to \u201cstep up and donate.\u201d It has sent blood collection buses to schools and asks students on its website: \u201cAre you up for saving lives?\u201d It holds a donation competition for local high schools called \u201cGeneration Give\u201d with $750 top prizes, and has offered incentives to donors such as free movie tickets and amusement park passes. Students who have donated six blood products or more \u201chave made the difference in the lives of over 18 hospital patients,\u201d STBTC states on its website. Honored students receive a special red cord to wear at their high school graduation ceremony.\n\nThe South Texas blood bank\u2019s main mission is to provide blood to approximately 100 hospitals and clinics, Elizabeth Waltman, STBTC\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. But \u201cafter community needs are met, and to ensure no donated blood is wasted, we provide blood where it is needed, including to support research that will advance medical care,\u201d she added. Ambrosia\u2019s study met STBTC\u2019s requirements for research-related use of their blood components, she said.\n\nSTBTC did not comment on whether it sold donations that came through Generation Give as young plasma. But its consent forms for blood donors \u201cclearly state\u201d that donations will be used to serve \u201cboth clinical and research purposes,\u201d Waltman said. HuffPost reviewed a copy of STBTC\u2019s 1,200-word student consent form, which requires kids and parents to acknowledge that donated blood may be used to help patients \u201cor for any other medical purpose.\u201d The form praises students for \u201cgiving the gift of life.\u201d\n\nThe Trial\n\nBy the fall of 2016, Karmazin was ready to launch his study.\n\nAmbrosia told trial participants that \u201cabundant data\u201d from mice studies suggested young plasma infusions could help with \u201crejuvenation,\u201d but the company said it couldn\u2019t guarantee participants any specific results, such as the treatment of a disease. Rather, it noted in its informed consent form that there are \u201cno known improvements\u201d directly related to young plasma infusions. In fact, the form contained \u201can appalling lack of detailed explanation of what the actual effects of this intervention are supposed to be,\u201d said Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who reviewed Ambrosia\u2019s form at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\nKarmazin contracted physicians to carry out the young plasma transfusions at clinics in San Francisco; Monterey, California; and Tampa, Florida. The Monterey-based doctor, David Wright, had been publicly reprimanded by the Medical Board of California in 2015 for charges that included gross negligence related to diagnosing a patient with a chronic tick-borne infection without an adequate basis, and then using a medically unsupported treatment \u2015 daily antibiotic infusion therapy \u2015 that led to significant side effects. Wright did not admit to wrongdoing in the agreement; the reprimand did not preclude him from practicing medicine.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said one director of transfusion medicine. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm.\u201d\n\nThen-New Scientist writer Sally Adee traveled to Monterey to cover Ambrosia\u2019s trial in 2017 and reported that a patient who came from Russia had an anaphylactic reaction after a transfusion. Wright was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d after the incident, Adee wrote.\n\nAmbrosia ultimately reported four adverse incidents during the trial, according to Barbara Krutchkoff, the executive director of the Institute of Regenerative and Cellular Medicine, a small nonprofit that houses an institutional review board that oversaw the study. They included a rash in March 2017, a runny nose and cold symptoms in April, hives and edema in June, and itchiness in December. All were considered mild allergic reactions and resolved, she said.\n\nAmbrosia was fortunate there weren\u2019t more adverse reactions, said Le, the physician and global health specialist.\n\n\u201cIn general, somebody who does not need a blood transfusion would be at great risk for all sorts of things, short term and long term,\u201d said Le, who was alarmed that Ambrosia claimed to give patients about 2 liters of plasma over just one to two days.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said Robertson Davenport, director of transfusion medicine at the University of Michigan. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the study, Karmazin and Wright had a falling-out. They disagreed over Karmazin\u2019s plans to transfuse smaller amounts of young plasma over a shorter period of time \u2014 a change Wright deemed risky, according to the New Scientist article. \u201cWe just had different ideas for what this treatment could become,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. Wright stopped working for Ambrosia before the study was complete.\n\nWright did not respond to several calls and emailed requests for comment. When HuffPost sent a reporter to his new office in Pacific Grove, his receptionist threatened to call the police.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s Still No Data\u2019\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial formally ended in January 2018. It was a great success, according to Karmazin, with about one-third of the participants returning to purchase additional treatments and around 150 treatments delivered in all. Some people continued to receive transfusions as late as this past summer, he said.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Ambrosia had been touting findings for months. Karmazin claimed to Canada\u2019s National Post, for example, that an early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patient showed improvements with one treatment and a person in their 60s saw their graying hair turn darker. He told New Scientist that he saw a 10 percent decrease in patients\u2019 blood cholesterol levels, and told Boss Magazine there were \u201creally dramatic improvements\u201d to biomarkers for inflammation.\n\n[Ambrosia] seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money. Michael Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nThe company said it tested patients\u2019 blood for more than 100 biomarkers before and after the transfusions, looking for improvements in markers for aging and disease. Ambrosia\u2019s study did not have a control group that received a placebo. And a change in a biomarker isn\u2019t necessarily proof of a change in actual health status, noted Charo, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor. Such changes must be matched to \u201creal health outcomes,\u201d which requires long-term follow-up. Karmazin said patients wrote diaries, and that some later volunteered additional health data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how Ambrosia\u2019s was set up as a clinical trial,\u201d said Michael Conboy, husband and research partner of Irina Conboy, the aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley. \u201cIt seemed to me that it was set up as more of a \u2018fee for service\u2019 type thing and the \u2018trial\u2019 part was slapped on to legitimize it. It seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still no public data. Karmazin shared some \u201cpreliminary results that he was excited about\u201d with his hired institutional review board, Krutchkoff said, but she hadn\u2019t seen the final results. Speaking to HuffPost with Karmazin\u2019s permission, Krutchkoff praised Karmazin\u2019s professionalism and brushed off criticisms of the study. \u201cAs controversial as this study was, there\u2019s a lot worse being done,\u201d she said.\n\nHoward Chipman, the doctor Ambrosia hired in Tampa, also said he hadn\u2019t seen the results. HuffPost could not find a participant who had.\n\nTom Casey, the CEO of NuPlasma, a company that sells young plasma to physicians in Texas \u2015 and is supplying another young plasma study in Houston \u2014 urged Karmazin to release the data. \u201cThe people who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you called this a trial and said you were collecting data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still no data.\u201d\n\nResults Not Guaranteed\n\nKarmazin and David Cavalier, Ambrosia\u2019s then-president and chief operating officer, said earlier this past fall that they had to be careful not to make any guarantees about the effects of Ambrosia\u2019s treatment. Companies generally need to get approval from the FDA before they can claim that a drug or medical product treats, cures or prevents a disease. Cavalier noted that Ambrosia transfused a Parkinson\u2019s patient who reported an improvement in a tremor, a patient with depleted testosterone levels who was soon \u201cenjoying morning erections again,\u201d and people who reported improvements with arthritis symptoms, sleep, memory and energy levels.\n\nSome of Ambrosia\u2019s claims to the media have been \u201cmaybe a little bit exuberant\u201d but still \u201c100 percent accurate,\u201d Karmazin said.\n\nKarmazin told HuffPost in the fall he temporarily paused transfusions to focus on opening a clinic in New York City by early 2019. Ambrosia is required to obtain a permit to transfuse a blood component in New York, but as of mid-December, the company had not applied for one, according to a New York State Department of Health spokesperson.\n\nHe initially claimed he planned to publish the findings of Ambrosia\u2019s study in a peer-reviewed journal after its clinic was open. He announced this week on his website that Ambrosia is scheduling clients again in San Francisco and Tampa. He brought back two doctors he worked with during the study, he told HuffPost. He said this week that he still hadn\u2019t submitted any data for peer review \u2014 a process that can take months. He was \u201ceager to do so,\u201d but didn\u2019t know precisely when he would.\n\nCavalier quietly left the company this week, right before Ambrosia announced it was offering treatments again. He would not comment on the circumstances of his exit, but noted in an email that he was only with the company for \u201ca very brief period.\u201d Karmazin declined to comment further on Cavalier\u2019s departure.\n\nAnd at least one of Ambrosia\u2019s blood bank partners no longer sells young plasma. Shortly after HuffPost reached out to the South Texas blood bank in October, it abruptly halted all sales of young plasma products, according to an employee email chain HuffPost obtained.\n\n\u201cWe have had a few developments internally due to some negative press,\u201d an employee wrote on Oct. 22. Waltman, the STBTC executive, told HuffPost the bank would not supply Ambrosia with plasma for a clinic rollout because doing so would interfere with their ability to fulfill local needs. The HuffPost inquiry had no bearing on that issue, she added.\n\nFor all its press coverage, Ambrosia did not have any investors as of April 2017, Karmazin said; in September 2018, Karmazin told HuffPost that Ambrosia hadn\u2019t yet raised any money. That same month, he advertised on his LinkedIn page that the company was looking for $3 million to open its first clinic. By November, Karmazin said the LinkedIn posts had been removed because the company had garnered a \u201clarge amount of interest,\u201d but Ambrosia would not comment on whether it had any investors.\n\nDespite Karmazin\u2019s insistence that many people are excited about the treatment, over the course of reporting this story, Ambrosia declined to put HuffPost in touch with a single patient. Initially, Karmazin said the patients are protective of their privacy and \u201cafter the hundredth reporter asked to talk, people were just getting a little tired of answering the same questions.\u201d After HuffPost noted that it could find only one trial participant who had spoken to the press, Karmazin said that in the beginning, he had asked about 10 to 15 patients if they wanted to speak to reporters, but they all declined.\n\nIt appears the only participant in Ambrosia\u2019s trial who spoke to the press was a man from Georgia. He told a German newspaper that he was one of Ambrosia\u2019s first patients and had perhaps received \u201cmore blood plasma than anyone else in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia man was \u201cthe most excited person about this treatment,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. He died after going into cardiac arrest in February 2018 at the age of 65.\n\nYoung plasma \u201cisn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d the man told New Scientist last year. But he had hoped he could \u201cjust get 10 more healthy years of living.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s family did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the circumstances of his death, and a doctor familiar with his case declined to comment without a family member\u2019s permission. Karmazin said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment. It is unclear when the man received his final treatment with Ambrosia.\n\nThese days, Karmazin won\u2019t even publicly admit whether he has tried the treatment Ambrosia is hawking. He told one news outlet in June 2017 he hadn\u2019t, claiming he was waiting until he\u2019d be \u201cold enough\u201d at 35. In a separate interview in December 2017, when he was still not yet 35, he said he\u2019d tried it \u201ca few times\u201d and it felt \u201cpretty phenomenal.\u201d Speaking to HuffPost, he refused to comment, citing privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to confirm that I\u2019ve done it for the purposes of this interview,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, spending $8,000 on a young plasma transfusion is a \u201creally good use of people\u2019s health care dollars,\u201d Karmazin said. Those with certain diseases \u201cshould be getting treatment right away,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to be treating as many people as possible.\u201d\n\nThis week, Karmazin announced Ambrosia has lowered its age limit and raised its prices. People as young as 30 are now eligible for treatment. And two liters of young plasma costs $12,000.\n\nGot tips?

Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind the assisted living facility in 2016.\n\nBy Jordan Rau\n\nThey found Bonnie Walker\u2019s body floating in a pond behind her assisted living facility in South Carolina. There were puncture wounds on her ear, temple, jaw and cheeks.\n\nBut her right forearm and pacemaker were missing. Later, they were found inside one of the alligators in the pond.\n\nLike 4 in 10 residents in assisted living facilities, Walker, 90, had dementia. Shortly after midnight one day in July 2016, she slipped out of her facility, Brookdale Charleston, as she had done a few days before. This time, no one noticed her missing for seven hours.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to pass away that way,\u201d her granddaughter Stephanie Weaver said.\n\nAssisted living facilities were originally designed for people who were largely independent but required help bathing, eating or with other daily tasks. Unlike nursing homes, the facilities generally do not provide skilled medical care or therapy, and stays are not paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nDementia care is the fastest-growing segment of assisted living. An increasing number of residences are built to cater to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia. But across the country, many of them are also struggling to deliver on their promises of security and attentive care, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of inspection records in the three most populous states.\n\nIn California, 45 percent of assisted living facilities have violated one or more state dementia regulations during the past five years. Three of the 12 most common California citations in 2017 were related to dementia care.\n\nIn Florida, one in 11 assisted living facilities have been cited since 2013 for not meeting state rules designed to prevent residents from wandering away.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A sign near the pond behind Brookdale Charleston, an assisted living facility in South Carolina, warns about the potential risk of alligators.\n\nAnd in Texas, nearly a quarter of the facilities that accept residents with Alzheimer\u2019s have violated one or more state rules, such as creating a plan of care for each resident with dementia upon admission or ensuring that staff members have completed special training, according to nearly six years of records.\n\n\u201cThere is a belief in our office that many facilities do not staff to the level\u201d necessary to meet the unanticipated \u201cneeds of residents, especially medical needs,\u201d said Fred Steele, Oregon\u2019s long-term care ombudsman. \u201cMany of these are for-profit entities. They are setting staffing ratios that maybe aren\u2019t being set because of the care needs of the residents but are more about the bottom line of their profits.\u201d\n\nUneven regulation\n\nThese concerns, though particularly acute for people with dementia, apply to all assisted living residents. They are older and frailer than assisted living residents were a generation ago. Within a year, one in five experience a fall, one in eight visit an emergency room and one in 12 have an overnight hospital stay, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Half are 85 or older.\n\n\u201cAssisted living was created to be an alternative to nursing homes, but if you walk into some of the big assisted living facilities, they sure feel like a nursing home,\u201d said Doug Pace, director for mission partnerships with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nYet the rules for assisted living remain looser than for nursing homes. The federal government does not license or oversee assisted living facilities, and some states set tougher rules than others.\n\nThe government does not publish quality measures as it does for nursing homes. Inspections usually are less frequent, and fines are generally far lower than what a nursing home might incur for a similar mistake.\n\nLindsay Schwartz, an associate vice president at the National Center for Assisted Living, an industry group, said facilities often juggle what could be conflicting goals at times, such as ensuring the safety of their residents without overly restricting their movement and the ability to socialize.\n\n\u201cDementia is a difficult disease,\u201d she said. \u201cFreedom of movement is incredibly important for overall health, mind, body and spirit. You can\u2019t keep people in isolation.\u201d\n\nIndustry official say rigid government regulations don\u2019t mesh with the individual approaches that assisted living facilities aspire to create for residents.\n\nBut residents\u2019 families, their lawyers and advocates say the violent behavior of agitated residents and escapes could be avoided if there are regulations to ensure better training and more staffing. Eliza Cantwell, a lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina, said too many facilities were accepting residents they weren\u2019t prepared to adequately care for because they wanted to maximize their income.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the qualified personnel to take care of these people, and they\u2019re taking care of them anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nCantwell is representing Weaver in a suit against Brookdale for emotional distress, which Weaver says came from being among the first people to discover her grandmother\u2019s body. Brookdale has already settled a wrongful-death claim from Bonnie Walker\u2019s estate.\n\nThe company declined to discuss Weaver\u2019s lawsuit and said in a statement that \u201cour everyday focus and priority is to keep residents safe.\u201d Brookdale called Walker\u2019s death \u201can unfortunate accident\u201d and said it has retrained its staff.\n\nA year after Walker\u2019s death, after four inspections, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale for 11 violations, including not properly performing night checks and letting staffing drop below required levels. The penalty: $6,400.\n\n\u201cI worked as a law enforcement agent for the Department of Natural Resources, and I\u2019ve written wildlife tickets larger than what DHEC did,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThis was nothing.\u201d\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN Stephanie Weaver holds a photo of her grandmother, Bonnie Walker. Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind her assisted living facility in 2016.\n\n\u2018Get him away from me\u2019\n\nNearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s 30,000 assisted living facilities either house only people with dementia or have special areas known as memory care units. These wings have locked doors and other safeguards to prevent residents from leaving. The facilities often train staff members in techniques to manage behavior related to these diseases and provide activities to keep the residents engaged and stimulated.\n\nThese units usually are more expensive, with monthly costs averaging $6,472, compared with $4,835 for regular assisted living, according to a survey by the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, a group that analyzes elder care market trends. Senior housing investors earned nearly 15 percent in annual returns over the past five years, higher than for apartment, hotel, office and retail properties, according to the center. Beth Burnham Mace, chief economist at the center, said memory care unit construction was outpacing all other types of senior housing.\n\nAggressive behavior, a hallmark of dementia, is a major problem in assisted living facilities. One national study, published in 2016, found that 8 percent of assisted living residents were physically aggressive or abusive toward other residents or staff.\n\nIn the dementia unit of The Point at Rockridge, an assisted living facility in Oakland, California, a resident identified in court papers as Ian began to follow another resident, Olivia Deloney, an 88-year-old with dementia. Before retiring, she had been dean of students at a school for the blind.\n\n\u201cThat man is crazy,\u201d one employee recalled Deloney saying, according to the employee\u2019s sworn statement. \u201cGet him away from me.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, Ian grabbed Deloney and threw her to the ground, breaking her right hip, a video shows. When paramedics were putting her into a stretcher, Ian tried to kick her, and the emergency workers had to keep him away, the police report said.\n\nAfterward, the administrators told Deloney\u2019s daughter, Simone Stevens, that they had not known that Ian, a retired university facilities engineer, was dangerous, her lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cThey just made it sound like it was like a freak accident: \u2018He\u2019s really just a calm and likable resident,\u2019\u201d Stevens said in an interview.\n\nA state investigation report said The Point had been trying to address his behavioral problems before the attack. State regulators declined to punish The Point, saying in their report that there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence that the facility had \u201cclear knowledge\u201d Ian would be a danger to other residents.\n\nBut when Stevens sued The Point, her lawyer, Felicia Curran, discovered that Ian\u2019s agitated behavior, including pushing and shoving, had been the reason his wife initially placed him there. At The Point, he had punched one aide in the shoulders, grabbed another by the neck and jumped on a third and beaten her, employees said in statements taken by Curran.\n\n\u201cIt was an everyday thing for him to chase staff and be physically aggressive,\u201d one declared. Aides posted a photo of him in their kitchen, warning colleagues to watch out for his violent outbursts, and employees once locked themselves in bathrooms for protection, according to records in the case.\n\n\u201cThey should have never had him there in the first place,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A year after Bonnie Walker\u2019s death in 2016, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale $6,400 for 11 violations.\n\nTracee DeGrande, the president of Integral Senior Living, which owns The Point, wrote in a statement that the episode was not typical. \u201cOur staff associates work hard to care for residents, many of whom would have nowhere to go if we didn\u2019t provide a place for those living with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAfter the attack, The Point evicted Ian. Deloney returned to the facility, but, less stable after surgery, she fell and broke her hip again. She stopped eating and died that December, according to her family\u2019s lawsuit, which blamed The Point for not increasing supervision in light of Deloney\u2019s weakened state.\n\nThe Point paid $1.9 million to settle the case. DeGrande wrote that the \u201csettlement was in no way an admission of responsibility for what ended up as a difficult and sad situation.\u201d\n\nTo calm agitated residents, some facilities are too reliant on psychotropic drugs, which carry increased risk of strokes, falls and confusion. An in-progress study funded by the National Institutes of Health has discovered that 27 percent of residents with dementia take an antipsychotic medication, and most lack documentation assuring the drugs are justified, said the lead investigator, Sheryl Zimmerman, a health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nZimmerman said such drugs are often not necessary if residents are cared for by experienced aides who can de-escalate troubling behaviors and know techniques that engage and soothe those with dementia. But she said low pay and frequent turnover make that difficult. \u201cThe workforce could be better trained than they are,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nInadequate state oversight?\n\nStaffing and training requirements vary greatly from state to state. A study published in 2016 and led by Paula Carder, a professor at Portland State University, found that only seven states required facilities to have a registered nurse. States required anywhere from two to 30 hours of training for dementia unit workers. A handful of states required no specialized training, according to the study. Carder found that 19 states set minimum staff-to-resident ratios for dementia units, while the others left it to the facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina requires one of the tightest staffing ratios in the nation for dementia units: one worker for every eight residents during the day and evening. But meeting that rule proves challenging for at least one facility, according to a lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, Michele Mullen asserted that Franklin Manor Assisted Living in Youngsville, North Carolina, did not meet the state\u2019s staffing minimums on a third of the days her mother, Claire Murphy, lived there in 2015 and 2016.\n\nShe said she would find her mother with her pants wet with urine all the way down to her knees, according to a deposition she gave in the lawsuit. Mullen said aides had repeatedly misplaced her mother\u2019s walker. She would see her mother holding onto the hallway railing as she tried to get to her room. On New Year\u2019s Day in 2016, her mother fell and was hospitalized for a fractured arm.\n\nGregory Nicoluzakis, the general counsel for Saber Healthcare Group, which owns Franklin Manor, said in an email that Mullen\u2019s allegations were inaccurate. \u201cWe believe it is telling that Ms. Mullen admitted her mother to our facilities on three separate occasions despite having the choice of other providers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDrew Hathaway, an attorney for Mullen, said there were no better alternatives nearby that had memory care units. \u201cThere are not that many facilities in these rural areas,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sad reality.\u201d\n\nFranklin Manor was fined in 2016 for not following doctors\u2019 orders that two residents needed to use walkers. In February, the state cited it for not supervising five residents, all with histories of falling, who had fallen and injured themselves. Nicoluzakis said Franklin Manor was in compliance with state regulations.\n\nMullen ultimately removed her mother from Franklin Manor; Murphy died last December.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018Mom needs to go to the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018Mom needs help with this,\u2019\u201d Mullen recalled in her deposition. \u201cAnd they would look at me and actually say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it?\u2019\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

An intermittent blockade by the Saudis and their partners in the United Arab Emirates has pushed as many as 12 million people to the brink of starvation, killing some 85,000 children, according to aid groups.\n\nLed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.\n\nAt any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.\n\nAlmost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.\n\nMost belong to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed. They were blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes during Darfur\u2019s conflict, and veterans involved in those horrors are now leading their deployment to Yemen \u2014 albeit in a more formal and structured campaign."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Other Democrats Shift into High Gear for 2020", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-kamala-elizabeth-warren.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "The four senators hope that jumping into the race early will give them some organizational advantages in a contest that will almost certainly grow to more than a dozen candidates.\n\nThis kind of early frenetic activity \u2014 almost two years before the election \u2014 has happened before in primaries without a clear front-runner. At this time four years ago, many Republicans began preparing campaigns, wooing supporters and tacitly permitting fund-raising by allies in the wide-open race for the 2016 nomination, a contest that would ultimately attract more than a dozen candidates within months.\n\nAlready, at least two of the senators have nearly settled on close political lieutenants to serve as campaign managers, turning to male aides with whom they have deep and trusting personal relationships. Ms. Gillibrand is eyeing Jess Fassler, her current top aide, who is leaving his role in the Senate early in 2019, as a leading contender to manage her campaign. Ms. Harris is expected to name Juan Rodriguez, who helmed her campaign for the Senate in 2016, as her manager.\n\nIn a further sign of how developed her plans are, Ms. Harris\u2019s aides are close to selecting Baltimore or Atlanta for her headquarters, according to people who have met with her team. She is likely to maintain a sizable office on the West Coast, perhaps in her native Oakland, but her political advisers have concluded that for practical reasons it is essential that she have a base in the Eastern Time zone.\n\nMs. Warren is expected to install Dan Geldon, her former chief of staff who was once her student at Harvard Law School and left her Senate office to plan her likely campaign, in a senior role directing campaign strategy. She has a head start on staffing: During the midterm campaign, Ms. Warren deployed staff to the four early primary states and a number of general election battlegrounds to elect other Democrats.

Mr. Cohen would later tell prosecutors that he acted at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction and to influence the election.\n\nAfter the release of an audio recording of the two men discussing a hush-money payment to another woman, Mr. Trump claimed in an August interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that he did not know about the payments until \u201clater on\u201d and that Mr. Cohen \u201cmade the deals.\u201d He then misleadingly compared Mr. Cohen\u2019s actions \u2014 a willful violation of campaign finance law \u2014 to a civil infraction incurred by former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nBy December, Mr. Trump\u2019s defense had shifted further: \u201cI never directed Michael Cohen to break the law.\u201d\n\nMisleading Vagueness and Fanciful Details\n\nThe president is known for being unscripted and loose with language, but he sometimes shows tactical restraint.\n\nAfter Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court and in the days before the midterm elections, Mr. Trump told rallygoers in Missouri that \u201cthe accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story, it was false accusations.\u201d\n\nThe omission of a name and the use of the words \u201cthe accuser\u201d may give the misleading impression that Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to Congress that Justice Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, had recanted her account. But in fact, Mr. Trump was referring to another little-known accuser named Judy Munro-Leighton, who recanted her claim of sexual assault."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: Marburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/health/marburg-virus-fruit-bats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "The Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, has been isolated in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the first time it has been found in West Africa.\n\nFive bats caught in three health districts tested positive for the virus, according to two teams of scientists.

The F.D.A. insists the six artificial flavors \u201cdo not pose a risk to public health,\u201d but concedes that the law requires it not approve the food additives. Food companies will have at least two years to remove them from their products.\n\nHere\u2019s a short list of some of the food additives restricted by the European Union but allowed in American foods. Most must be listed as ingredients on the labels, though information about drugs used to increase the yield in farm animals is generally not provided.\n\nPotassium bromate and azodicarbonamide (ADA)\n\nThese additives are commonly added to baked goods, but neither is required, and both are banned in Europe because they may cause cancer. In recent years, some American restaurant chains have responded to consumer pressure and removed them from their food.\n\nPotassium bromate is often added to flour used in bread, rolls, cookies, buns, pastry dough, pizza dough and other items to make the dough rise higher and give it a white glow. The International Agency for Research on Cancer considers it a possible human carcinogen, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the F.D.A. to ban it nearly 20 years ago. The F.D.A. says potassium bromate has been in use since before the Delaney amendment on carcinogenic food additives was passed.\n\nAzodicarbonamide, or ADA, which is used as a whitening agent in cereal flour and as a dough conditioner, breaks down during baking into chemicals that cause cancer in lab animals. It is used by many chain restaurants that serve sandwiches and buns. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has urged the F.D.A. to bar its use. The F.D.A. says it is safe in limited amounts."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Phys Ed: Year in Fitness: How Exercise Keeps Us Young", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/well/move/2018-year-in-fitness-how-exercise-keeps-us-young.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-29 19:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "Some of the biggest news in exercise science this year concerned the tiniest impacts from physical activity, which does not mean that the impacts were inconsequential.

And then it all came out.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time patients have told me that having a life-threatening diagnosis like leukemia roused some past demons, or made them see their relationships in a different light. For some, dodging the bullet of leukemia made them cherish their partner and their parents and children even more. For others, with a second lease on life, they realized that they didn\u2019t want to squander the opportunity with someone they really didn\u2019t get along with, and divorce often resulted, or a rift with other relatives.\n\n\u201cWhat an awful thing to happen,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t pick up on it.\u201d I blamed myself for not noticing her sadness.

The United States Navy recently traded an 18-hour submarine shift schedule for a 24-hour one that more closely matches sailors\u2019 biological rhythms. And at some pharmaceutical, software and financial companies, managers expect employees to come to the office for only a few hours in the middle of the day \u2014 or to work off site entirely.\n\n\u201cI think circadian rhythms will be a huge issue for human resources in the future,\u201d said Camilla Kring, a Danish consultant who has helped employees at AbbVie, Roche, Medtronic and other companies learn to respect their natural sleep cycles. \u201cIt really makes sense to think about when people have the most energy and when they\u2019re peaking mentally.\u201d\n\nWorker fatigue has played a role in many workplace accidents, most famously the Challenger space shuttle explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but no doubt countless more on the commute to and from work. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy drivers cause 16.5 percent of fatal crashes.\n\nA survey released last year by the National Safety Council found that 97 percent of workers have at least one risk factor for fatigue, with 27 percent reporting having unintentionally fallen asleep on the job in the previous month and 16 percent that they had experienced at least one safety incident because of fatigue.\n\n\u201cWe have a 24/7 society, so we knew fatigue was definitely affecting part of our work force,\u201d said Emily Whitcomb, senior program manager of the council\u2019s fatigue initiative. \u201cBut we did not anticipate that fatigue was going to be affecting almost 100 percent of our work force.\u201d\n\nSleep deprivation may even lead to ethical breaches at work. In a 2014 experiment, Christopher Barnes of the University of Washington and colleagues asked 142 people with extreme chronotypes to show up at their laboratory either at 7 a.m. or at midnight for a dice-rolling game that offered a $500 prize. Reporting was on the honor system. Morning people lied 18 percent more when they did the task at midnight than when they did it in the morning, whereas night owls lied 16 percent more when doing the task at 7 a.m.\n\nDr. Roenneberg has collected data from 300,000 people and found that chronotypes plot as a bell-shaped curve, with a few individuals at each extreme and most falling somewhere in the middle. According to Dr. Roenneberg\u2019s research, the most frequent chronotype \u2014 held by about 13 percent of the population \u2014 sleeps from around midnight to 8 a.m. Thirty-one percent of people have an earlier natural bedtime, and 56 percent have a later one. That means for at least 69 percent of the population, getting to the office by 8 or 9 a.m. requires waking up before their body is ready."}]
