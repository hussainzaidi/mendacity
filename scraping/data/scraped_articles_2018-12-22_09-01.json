None of the sources suggested that the President directed Whitaker to stop the investigation, but rather lashed out at what he felt was an unfair situation.\n\nThe first known instance took place when Trump made his displeasure clear to acting attorney general Matt Whitaker after Cohen pleaded guilty November 29 to lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Whitaker had only been on the job a few weeks following Trump's firing of Jeff Sessions.\n\nOver a week later, Trump again voiced his anger at Whitaker after prosecutors in Manhattan officially implicated the President in a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of women around the 2016 campaign -- something Trump fiercely maintains isn't an illegal campaign contribution. Pointing to articles he said supported his position, Trump pressed Whitaker on why more wasn't being done to control prosecutors in New York who brought the charges in the first place, suggesting they were going rogue.\n\nThe previously unreported discussions between Trump and Whitaker described by multiple sources familiar with the matter underscore the extent to which the President firmly believes the attorney general of the United States should serve as his personal protector. The episodes also offer a glimpse into the unsettling dynamic of a sitting president talking to his attorney general about investigations he's potentially implicated in.\n\nWhitaker and William \"Bill\" Barr, Trump's nominee to replace Sessions, are facing increased scrutiny this week for their criticisms of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling. Whitaker refused to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe. And a memo from Barr came to light in which he wrote that Trump's decision to fire former FBI director James Comey did not amount to obstruction.\n\nTrump has already shown a willingness to use the Justice Department to settle political scores. As CNN previously reported , the President questioned Whitaker about the progression of the investigation against Hillary Clinton when Whitaker was Jeff Sessions' chief of staff.\n\n\"It seems very clear that the only reason that Matt Whitaker was ever appointed to this role was specifically to oversee the Mueller investigation,\" Mueller biographer Garrett Graff said on Friday in an interview on CNN's Newsroom.\n\nWith Sessions, Trump ranted publicly about how he did nothing to curtail the Mueller investigation. Sessions had recused himself from oversight because of his role on the Trump campaign.\n\n\"Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,\" the President tweeted in August.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on any discussions between Whitaker and the President.\n\nThe President's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, could not confirm the conversations with Whitaker but said the President views the SDNY prosecutors as out of control. \"The president and his lawyers are upset about the professional prosecutors in the Southern District of New York going after a non-crime and the innuendo the president was involved,\" Giuliani said in a statement to CNN Friday.\n\nOne source close to Whitaker pushed back on the notion that the Cohen situation caused tension between the two, emphasizing that Whitaker and the President have a \"great relationship.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Pope Francis tells clerics who abuse minors to turn themselves in", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/IVUOc0tElw0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Rome (CNN) Pope Francis has told those who abuse minors to hand themselves in to civil justice authorities and \"prepare for divine justice,\" in his strongest words to date on the sex abuse crisis roiling the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn his annual speech to the Vatican's Curia on Friday morning, the Pope also thanked the media for exposing the sex abuse crisis and encouraged survivors to speak out.\n\n\"I myself would like to give heartfelt thanks to those media professionals who were honest and objective and sought to unmask these predators and to make their victims' voices heard,\" the Pope said.\n\n\"The Church asks that people not be silent... since the greater scandal in this matter is that of cloaking the truth,\" he said.\n\n\"To those who abuse minors I would say this -- convert and hand yourself over to human justice and prepare for divine justice.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "British woman allegedly raped in Indian tourist hotspot", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/m7SjBdFVRe4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "New Delhi (CNN) A 31-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping a British woman in the western Indian state of Goa.\n\nThe victim was walking back to her hotel on Thursday in the popular tourist destination when the incident took place, according to Rajendra Dessai, a police officer at the Canacona police station in southern Goa.\n\n\"The incident was reported very early in the morning, at around 4:30 a.m,\" Dessai said. \"There is a slightly lonely spot on the road there and that is where the man was.\n\n\"He took her into the fields and raped her and then he took her bags with him.\"\n\nThe accused has been arrested on suspicion of rape and robbery, Dessai added.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "From Shanghai to Frankfurt, these 8 stock indices are in bear markets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/1qXAxMLhSM8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN Business) Global markets are having a rough 2018.

Today, it's struggling to stay afloat.\n\nBacked by billions of dollars from high-profile investors like Alibaba ( BABA ), Ofo helped pioneer the dockless bike-sharing phenomenon that swept across Chinese cities in recent years. The bikes can be locked and unlocked anywhere via a smartphone app, which means users don't have to return them to designated stations.\n\nOfo fended off dozens of copycat rivals, but it now risks becoming the latest casualty of a cut-throat industry. Hordes of angry customers gathered outside its headquarters in Beijing this week to demand refunds. The company and its founder have been put on a government black list for failing to pay debts.\n\n\"They snapped defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Jeffrey Towson, a private equity investor and professor at Peking University.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nOfo users lined up outside the bike sharing company's headquarters this week, demanding refunds.\n\nStruggling to keep up\n\nBike-sharing startups in China burned through cash as they rushed to launch services in cities throughout the country and overseas. The chaotic expansion resulted in a string of bankruptcies and huge piles of impounded bikes.\n\nOfo survived that shakeout, but has struggled to keep up with its rivals since.\n\nDockless bike sharing was a great standalone service when it launched in 2015, but it now makes more sense for companies like Ofo to team up with other transportation platforms, analysts say.\n\nThese days, people want to use one app where \"you can hail a scooter or a bike or a car,\" said Tu Le, founder of consulting firm Sino Auto Insights. \"That's where the sweet spot's going to be.\"\n\nOfo's rivals have already adapted to the shifting landscape.\n\nMobike was acquired in April by a bigger tech startup, Meituan Dianping, while Hellobike joined forces with digital payments giant Ant Financial. Both Meituan and Ant offer a wide range of services though their apps, which are used by hundreds of millions of people in China.\n\nThe partnerships gave Ofo's rivals access to more users and also allowed them to offer their users a greater variety of services, such as ride-hailing and food delivery.\n\nThousands of Ofo and Mobike's bikes were impounded in Shanghai last year. Authorities said they breached parking restrictions.\n\nAll alone\n\nIndustry watchers expected Ofo to be acquired by its big ride-hailing backer, Didi Chuxing, the company that drove Uber out of China. But that never happened.\n\nInstead, Didi snapped up another bike-sharing company, Bluegogo.\n\n\"When Didi suddenly bought Bluegogo and launched their own bike-sharing service, that was a red flag,\" Towson said. \"That's like when your wife tells you she's starting to date again.\"\n\nOfo suffered another big blow in July when Mobike said users no longer need to pay deposits for its services. Hellobike soon followed suit.\n\nWithout a deep-pocketed partner, Ofo couldn't afford to take the same step. Investor enthusiasm had waned, cash was low because of its costly global expansion and suppliers were beginning to demand payment.\n\nThe startup also struggled to repair damaged bikes, according to Xue Yu, an analyst at research firm IDC. That made it harder for its customers to find available bikes, prompting them to switch to its competitors.\n\nOfo is now \"suffering the most serious consumer crisis of trust,\" Xue said.\n\nOfo bikes waiting for repair in Beijing last year.\n\nFounder talks of bankruptcy\n\nIts founder Dai Wei said in a letter to employees Wednesday that because of the startup's financial crisis, he had \"even thought about dissolving the company and filing for bankruptcy so that you don't have to continue to bear such pressures.\"\n\n\"Recently, the pressure from cash flow and the media has made us feel powerless,\" Dai wrote in the letter, which was shared on Chinese social media and translated by Tech In Asia . An Ofo spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the letter and the accuracy of the translation but declined to comment further.\n\nBeing on the government blacklist means Ofo and Dai face restrictions including not being allowed to buy plane tickets or rent space in high-end office buildings.\n\nOfo said it will refund deposits and is asking users to be patient. More than 12.3 million people were waiting for refunds on Friday, according to its app.\n\nSome disgruntled users have lined up outside Ofo's Beijing headquarters this week, demanding a refund of their deposits, which range from 99 to 199 yuan ($14 to $28). Some of them became emotional on Friday, yelling at security guards and police officers who were keeping watch over the crowd.\n\nMany Ofo users have also sounded off on social media, saying they doubt they'll ever get a refund.\n\n'Just a fad'\n\nThe public outcry has prompted a response from government officials.\n\nMinistry of Transportation spokesperson Wu Chungen on Friday urged Ofo to reduce spending to ensure it can pay back users and also to speed up the refund process.\n\nBut it also called on people to be more supportive of Ofo.\n\n\"Let's be more tolerant and leave room for trials and errors for new things,\" Wu said. \"This way we can help create a big environment that encourages innovation and development.\"\n\nZhang Xinyuan, a 37-year-old Ofo customer was standing outside the company's headquarters on Friday hoping to get her deposit back.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, Zhang said she will still feel she got her money's worth riding the \"little yellow bikes,\" referring to the company's Chinese nickname.\n\n\"I kind of saw it coming,\" she said of Ofo's troubles. \"I thought the little yellow bike was just a fad.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Dow suffers worst week since 2008 financial crisis", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/L-vjUeCkNDc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) The Dow just suffered its deepest weekly plunge since 2008 and the Nasdaq is officially in a bear market.\n\nThe miserable performance reflects deepening fears on Wall Street of an economic slowdown and overly-aggressive Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Dow closed 414 points, or 1.8%, lower on Friday.

Lying to a licensed gun dealer is a felony punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.\n\nBreaking that law might seem risky. But in September, a Government Accountability Office study made it clear why those who \"lie and try\" would take their chances. Regional offices at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives received 12,710 cases of firearm background check denials for further investigation in fiscal year 2017, the GAO found, but the government prosecuted only 12 people. More than 99.9% of those who were investigated escaped with nothing more than a warning.\n\nPast and present ATF agents and prosecutors told CNN that, given limited resources, they're not inclined to prioritize the nonviolent crime of lying on a form over more serious charges, like gun trafficking. The very few \"lie and try\" cases they prosecute focus on dangerous \"trigger pullers\" who clearly know they're prohibited from owning a firearm -- career criminals with a history of violence or activity in the drug trade.\n\nBut a 2006 internal ATF briefing paper obtained by CNN suggests that gun form liars are far more likely to go on to commit a gun crime than even many experts recognize. When ATF analyzed firearm denial cases sent to field offices for investigation during a seven-year period, it found that 10%-21% of that group went on to be arrested for a crime involving guns.\n\nTake John Zawahri, who tried to buy a gun at a California dealer in 2011. State investigators spotted at least one disqualifier -- he had been held at the UCLA hospital psychiatric ward as a violence-prone teen. The California Department of Justice denied him the purchase.\n\nLike almost all gun-form liars, Zawahri was not prosecuted. Undeterred, he built his own semi-automatic rifle mostly from mail-order parts and, two years later, went on a rampage. On June 7, 2013, he set his home on fire, executed his father and older brother with shots to the chest, then hijacked a car to Santa Monica College and killed three others. Dozens of students and bystanders managed to survive by hiding behind restaurant tables and library doors. Police officers caught up to Zawahri at the college library, where they shot him 25 times in a gun battle.\n\nWould prosecution for having lied on a gun form have stopped Zawahri from building his own gun and going on to use it? \"I don't believe it would make a difference. There would have been some short jail term, or probation, and he still would have accumulated the gun parts in the two years after that,\" Santa Monica Homicide Detective Chad Goodwin told CNN.\n\nBut a surprising range of authorities have argued that enforcing \"lie and try\" could make a difference -- including not only anti-gun groups and criminal justice academics, but also former law enforcement officers, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration, and even the National Rifle Association. By failing to bring charges in cases like Zawahri's, the government is leaving thousands of lawbreakers without any new blemish to their names.\n\nLike almost all Americans who lie on federal gun forms, John Zawahri was not prosecuted. He was one of many gun form liars who go on to commit crimes with a gun.\n\nThat reduces the law's function as a deterrent to prohibited possessors who might hope to get lucky with the federal background check system. It also allows gun form liars to fly under the radar for law enforcement -- and to avoid being assigned a probation officer who would monitor them to make sure they didn't obtain a weapon. And, in the event of a later crime, it leaves what could have been a significant previous charge -- which might typically lead to more prison time -- off their records.\n\nDavid Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that prosecutors and law enforcement officials should rid themselves of the idea that lying on gun forms is a crime not worth pursuing. \"It's worthwhile to go after these cases. The prosecution in question here is failing to fill out a form accurately. That doesn't seem like a big deal. But prosecution is a means to an end -- getting dangerous people off the street.\"\n\nIn Zawahri's case, failure to prosecute probably meant that the young man's years-long obsession with guns and violence stayed below the notice of investigators. Instead, his name merely became one of thousands sitting on law enforcement lists of those who have tried to purchase guns illegally and failed.\n\nA low priority for overburdened agents\n\nWhen you try to buy a firearm at a licensed dealer, you must fill out a federal form that asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using any illegal drugs, subject to a restraining order, or inside the United States illegally. It also asks if you've previously been convicted of a felony or domestic violence, adjudicated \"as a mental defective,\" dishonorably discharged from the military, or if you've ever renounced US citizenship.\n\nIf you're prohibited and answer truthfully, a gun dealer is supposed to scrap the sale. If you lie, a subsequent background check conducted by law enforcement is supposed to find any disqualifiers in your record. Twenty-nine states and Washington DC rely on the FBI for all firearm sale background checks, 13 states do their own, and 8 split the work. Then the cases are referred to law enforcement: It's up to ATF to investigate federal background check denials, while local police handle state-level denials. After the law enforcement agents investigate, they present potential cases to local or federal prosecutors, who ultimately decide whether to charge someone with a crime.\n\nThe federal gun form asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using illegal drugs, or inside the United States illegally, among other things.\n\nThe federal form, and the penalty for false statements on it, is there to discourage prohibited possessors from trying to buy guns in the first place. But a person only breaks the law if a prosecutor can show they \"knowingly\" made a false statement. That can be difficult to prove. Some people who approach a gun shop counter might legitimately forget about a decades-old domestic violence conviction or a felony they committed as a teen, current and former ATF agents said.\n\nStill, even for someone who is perfectly aware they're a prohibited possessor, it can be worth trying to buy a gun, because so few cases meet US attorneys' standards for potential criminal prosecution. The federal background check system blocked 112,090 attempts to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017. About a tenth of them were referred to ATF field offices for further investigation.\n\nEven when ATF agents do discover a potential gun buyer committed a crime, US attorneys usually don't have the appetite to take on these cases. According to the recent GAO report, federal prosecutors rarely pursue criminal charges, due to a perception that trying these cases in court \"may offer little value to public safety because the offender does not obtain the firearm.\"\n\nStates that handle these cases are also reluctant to divert troopers or local police away from their regular duties to look into this crime. When the GAO surveyed the 13 states that do their own background checks for all gun purchases, it found that 10 of them don't even investigate these denials, \"citing competing resource demands\" and a lack of laws on the books. The only states that investigated gun purchase denials were Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- and cases in those states had a high bar.\n\n\"We were surprised about the challenges,\" said Gretta Goodwin, who oversaw the study as GAO director of homeland security and justice issues. \"States were pretty clear with us that doing these investigations could be disruptive. They were taking state troopers off the road. They were having to make these kinds of sacrifices or tradeoffs.\"\n\nTo some criminal justice experts, the shortage of law enforcement resources to crack down on illegal attempted purchases of firearms is a symptom of a larger problem: We live in a country with more guns than we can afford to track. The sheer number of guns in civilian hands, they say -- 393 million, by one count -- fuel this problem in a way that will always outpace police efforts.\n\n\"This resource strain is a function of the system we have in place. There's a huge social cost for having a Second Amendment and relatively lax gun laws,\" said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nA stunning internal report\n\nIn an interview, former ATF special agent in charge David Chipman confirmed that he commissioned the 2006 internal report. He had been \"absolutely stunned\" by the results, he said.\n\n\"The assumption was these people weren't a threat,\" Chipman told CNN. He is now a senior policy adviser at the pro-gun control group Giffords.\n\nThe headquarters of ATF in Washington, DC. Internal research there found that a significant percentage of those left unprosecuted for the felony of lying on a gun form will go on to commit a gun crime.\n\nThe 30-page internal study explored how, despite an order from then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to crack down on \"those who attempt to purchase guns illegally,\" ATF agents rarely presented cases to prosecutors -- even if the cases met these attorneys' stringent guidelines. The study also highlighted the surprising importance of these cases by taking a closer look at some of the 82,047 cases ATF sent to its field offices for investigation from late 1998 until early 2006. Out of a random sample of 202 cases, 30 of them showed a \"subsequent arrest history (that) appeared to involve a firearm\" during the seven-year review period. Based on that, the report concluded that an estimated 10%-21% of people denied gun purchases -- whose cases made their way to ATF field offices -- committed \"subsequent crimes (that) involved firearms\" during the span of the study.\n\nIf the decade-old study's findings hold up, it suggests that anywhere from 1,322 to 2,631 of the 12,710 people who attempted to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017, failed a background check, and had their cases sent to ATF field offices, would eventually get a gun and commit a crime. Two criminal policy academics who reviewed the ATF paper at CNN's request said they were confident in the research paper's methodology and conclusions, and they think the rate of subsequent gun crimes by attempted purchasers would likely be the same or higher today.\n\nChipman thinks the problem may have gotten worse. Since 2006, online exchanges that connect buyers and sellers have changed the marketplace, making it easier than ever for a prohibited person to find a private seller and avoid a background check when buying a firearm. Federal law requires licensed gun shops to conduct background checks, but not private sellers.\n\nAnd states have a difficult time cracking down on a burgeoning phenomenon: mail-order gun parts and do-it-yourself \"ghost gun\" kits, like the ones that allowed Zawahri to construct his own firearm in California. Webster, the Johns Hopkins professor, noted that private gun ownership in general has significantly increased, flooding the market with weapons that criminals may obtain through theft or undocumented sales.\n\nSince the 2006 study, ATF has not assessed the threat from people who lie on gun background check forms, the agency told CNN. And the original paper remained unknown to the public, as is typical for such internal briefing papers. Asked why it was not released, ATF spokeswoman April Langwell told CNN: \"The draft report to which you refer is now 12 years old. I do not know why it was not finalized/released ... & obviously the individuals who were working then are long gone.\"\n\nChipman, who commissioned the briefing paper, said that the report was final and not a draft. \"The biggest frustration I ever had working at ATF is that some of this high-level data about what happens after people are denied\" never reaches the public, he said.\n\n\"It really is something the people need to know,\" he said. \"Facts matter. There's science and data. And that data should be out there ... it solidifies what the real challenges are so that policymakers have a shared group of facts.\"\n\nNew interest in lie-and-try; but so far, little change\n\nThe GAO investigator who recently reviewed prosecution of \"lie and try\" cases told CNN she was surprised to learn about the internal ATF statistics on subsequent crimes committed by people who provide false information on gun buying forms. The GAO was not aware of the briefing paper, GAO's Goodwin told CNN. Even without that information, however, the GAO acknowledged that a major crackdown would require more resources for law enforcement.\n\nThe GAO found that ATF agents sometimes simply send denied purchasers a text message or letter to deter future attempts -- and potentially serve as future evidence that the person knew they were prohibited. ATF officials told GAO they prefer text messages over official-looking warning letters because text messages \"are less intimidating to prohibited persons, the texts save time and money, and are more effective in helping retrieve firearms.\"\n\nThe GAO report suggests that ATF review the benefits of using text messages and warning letters \"as an enforcement tool,\" and perhaps consider making this an agency-wide policy. An ATF spokesman said there's no rigid policy at the agency for making contact with those who lie and try. Less serious cases, like those involving someone with a decades-old felony who tried to buy what's considered a turkey-hunting shotgun, result in a simple courtesy phone call to inform a rejected gun buyer why they were denied. More serious cases, like those involving domestic abusers who try to buy a handgun shortly after conviction, might result in a formal warning letter by mail or even a knock on the door.\n\nIn a country that has become increasingly polarized into Second Amendment rights and gun control camps, lie-and-try enforcement could be one area of consensus. The Democratic congressman who commissioned the report, US Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of the Bronx in New York, told CNN of its release: \"This is one rare moment where we can agree on guns.\"\n\n\"The laws we have should be enforced. We don't fund these agencies properly,\" he said. \"The end result is that people are getting guns who shouldn't get guns.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of 10 senators led by US Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in March that would force the FBI to notify local law enforcement whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and fails the background check. The NICS Denial Notification Act would not provide additional funding for local police to investigate gun form lying, but it would put lawbreakers on their radar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Toomey called his bill \"a commonsense, yet critical, step Congress should take to strengthen gun safety laws.\"\n\n\"One thing that both parties agree on when it comes to gun safety is that we should enforce the laws that we already have on the books,\" US Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, a co-sponsor of the bill, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House version of the bill is in a similar stage. A previous version of the bill, as written by US Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, failed to make it through the House in 2017.\n\nThe lobbying power that most fiercely opposes new gun laws, the National Rifle Association, told CNN it does not oppose the bill. As long as 18 years ago, the organization was calling for tougher crackdowns on prohibited possessors who attempt to buy firearms, framing the issue this way: \" prosecution is prevention .\"\n\n\"The National Rifle Association continues to support the prosecution of dangerous people who knowingly attempt to illegally purchase a firearm,\" said Lars Dalseide, an NRA spokesman.\n\nBecause the bill lacks new funding to pay for local officers to actually follow up on the additional criminal data, former ATF agents tell CNN they doubt the bill will be effective. A spokesman for Coons said the senator would be willing to support a funding provision for the bill \"if more resources are required to do the job correctly.\"\n\nIn March, former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo to step up enforcement of lying on gun forms, directing all of the country's US attorneys to \"enhance prosecution\" in each of their districts \"to ensure vigorous and appropriate prosecution of 'lie-and-try' cases.\" The memo still puts \"particular emphasis on cases against violent persons,\" such as those with previous convictions for violent felonies and misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.\n\n\"We are proud to have taken the most aggressive action to step up lie-and-try prosecutions in nearly a decade,\" a DOJ spokesman told CNN. He added that, under Sessions, the department has stepped up gun prosecutions in general, evident because it has \"charged the highest number of federal firearm defendants in history this past year.\" In fiscal year 2018, the federal government charged more than 15,300 people with firearms offenses -- 17% higher than ever before, according to the DOJ.\n\nThe attorney general's directive came as the GAO was ending its review, so the report didn't capture a possible shift on prosecutorial standards. Sessions ordered prosecutors in the nation's 94 judicial districts to meet with ATF and revise local prosecution guidelines \"as necessary.\" These guidelines are important, because they determine whether the feds in each district are willing to pursue charges -- and whether the bar could be higher, say, in Miami than in San Francisco.\n\nWhen asked by CNN, however, ATF could not point to any change in the way its agents approach these types of cases since the directive from Sessions. The agency indicated that it had \"met with all (US attorney's offices and) reviewed the guidelines.\"\n\nEven to find out what those prosecutorial standards are, and how they differ by region, is no easy task. In January, CNN filed a public records request to ATF for copies of the guidance it receives from local prosecutors about which cases to refer. ATF has not yet formally responded, but a spokesman redirected CNN to the Executive Office for the US Attorneys. CNN filed a similar request with that agency in June. It redirected CNN back to ATF.\n\nSome states have begun to recognize what a danger sign it can be for a prohibited person to skirt the law and try to buy a gun. Last year, Washington became the first state that notifies victims of domestic violence when their convicted abuser attempts to purchase a firearm. Gun dealers there must notify a state association of police and sheriffs whenever someone fails a background check, and the state's \"automated protected person notification system\" then passes on the information. Domestic violence groups in other states are taking notice.\n\n\"Too often our system turns a blind eye to how dangerous a case could be,\" said Tara Muir, policy director at the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. A prohibited person's attempt to buy a gun \"has to be one of the most dangerous indicators there is.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Workers scramble to keep a holiday tradition alive after California's wildfires", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/PVqq9LeLMSI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Camp Fire devastated Paradise, California, and the surrounding community, but it's not stopping one popular holiday tradition.\n\nWorkers have been scrambling all week to get the city's ice skating rink ready to open Saturday.\n\nThe city has run the rink every year since 2012, and Paradise Recreation and Park District Manager Dan Efseaff told CNN that it attracts more than 20,000 skaters each season.\n\nEfseaff said his staff was getting ready to open the rink when t he Camp Fire started November 8\n\nThe fire was the deadliest and most destructive in California history.

Workers also had to clear out burned benches, tables, pads, playground bark and other debris to get the rink ready.\n\nThe department's shop burned to the ground as the blaze destroyed most tools, six or seven vehicles, tractors and even the Zamboni used to smooth out the ice, Efseaff said.\n\nWorkers will clear the ice by hand until they can get a new machine.\n\nStaffing has also been an issue.\n\n\"Most of our staff lost homes and were difficult to get a hold of,\" he said. \"Some are staying too far away to work or have to attend to other issues.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, the ice rink is scheduled to open at noon Saturday, with a tree lighting ceremony later in the evening. It will be open until January 13.\n\n\"Remarkably, we've only started work on the rink since last weekend, and our crew has been working hard to clean up the facility (and) start work on other parks,\" Efseaff said.\n\nNews of the rink's reopening was greeted with enthusiasm on the city's Facebook page, with many discussing plans to strap on skates and do some Christmas shopping to support local businesses.\n\n\"Thank you for this lovely gift to our community,\" one woman wrote on Facebook.\n\nAnother said, \"This is wonderful, makes me feel like there is hope for Paradise!\"\n\nEfseaff said he hopes it will be a gathering spot for friends and neighbors who have been separated by the fire.

It expects to deliver nearly 16 billion pieces of mail and packages this season. Post offices will close at noon on Christmas Eve as planned.\n\nLaw enforcement and safety continue\n\nFederal employees who keep people safe or protect property must typically report to work during a shutdown.\n\nThat means many law enforcement officers will keep their schedules.\n\nIt also means the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will keep mission controllers on hand to support astronauts on the International Space Station but will close NASA facilities to visitors and suspend some research projects.\n\nSafety inspectors -- such as the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management and the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration officials, who monitor oil pipelines like the Trans-Alaska Pipeline -- will continue their work.\n\nIt's a similar story at the Agriculture Department's Food Safety Inspection Services, which inspects meat and poultry, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which will keep a bare-bones team to consider potential recalls of products that \"create a substantial and immediate threat to the safety of human life.\"\n\nForecasters at the National Weather Service, which is part of the Commerce Department, and earthquake monitors at the US Geological Survey, part of the Department of the Interior, will stay on the job, too.\n\nAlthough the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security are among the parts of the government that will not remain funded if the shutdown occurs, much of these agencies will remain open because they provide security functions.\n\nAt Justice, large parts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Bureau of Prisons and US attorneys' offices will remain open. Special counsel Robert Mueller's office will remain open as well, because it is funded with a permanent indefinite appropriation, according to the agency's shutdown plan.\n\nAt the Department of Homeland Security, about 55,000 Customs and Border Protection employees, about 55,000 Transportation Security Administration workers, about 44,000 Coast Guard employees, about 6,000 Secret Service employees and about 17,600 US Citizenship and Immigration Services workers will remain on the job through a shutdown.\n\nSupport staff, such as IT workers, necessary to support those whose work is essential will also be called in.\n\nWhen would federal workers see the effects?\n\nThe holiday season is likely the worst time for federal workers at the nine departments.\n\nWhile they will be paid for work performed before the shutdown, paychecks will not be cut while government agencies are closed. In past government shutdowns, Congress has often passed a bill to back-pay furloughed federal employees for the time they were not paid during the shutdown, but that is never a guarantee. Congress would have to pass a similar measure for furloughed federal employees to receive money lost during this shutdown. Contractors who work for the federal government may not be so lucky.\n\nOffice of Management and Budget guidelines also call for canceling paid vacation time that was scheduled over the holidays -- meaning many federal workers who took time off may see smaller paychecks.\n\nThe government would still process employee paychecks for the pay period ending on Saturday, although it wouldn't include pay for that day, because of the shutdown on Friday night. Employees' next paychecks would come after the government reopens.\n\nOther government services may not be available, though.\n\nThe National Park Service and the Forest Service, for example, generally lock up visitor centers and restrooms, and have only minimal staff, such as law enforcement, on hand.\n\nUnlike some past government shutdowns, this is a partial shutdown.

None of the sources suggested that the President directed Whitaker to stop the investigation, but rather lashed out at what he felt was an unfair situation.\n\nThe first known instance took place when Trump made his displeasure clear to acting attorney general Matt Whitaker after Cohen pleaded guilty November 29 to lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Whitaker had only been on the job a few weeks following Trump's firing of Jeff Sessions.\n\nOver a week later, Trump again voiced his anger at Whitaker after prosecutors in Manhattan officially implicated the President in a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of women around the 2016 campaign -- something Trump fiercely maintains isn't an illegal campaign contribution. Pointing to articles he said supported his position, Trump pressed Whitaker on why more wasn't being done to control prosecutors in New York who brought the charges in the first place, suggesting they were going rogue.\n\nThe previously unreported discussions between Trump and Whitaker described by multiple sources familiar with the matter underscore the extent to which the President firmly believes the attorney general of the United States should serve as his personal protector. The episodes also offer a glimpse into the unsettling dynamic of a sitting president talking to his attorney general about investigations he's potentially implicated in.\n\nWhitaker and William \"Bill\" Barr, Trump's nominee to replace Sessions, are facing increased scrutiny this week for their criticisms of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling. Whitaker refused to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe. And a memo from Barr came to light in which he wrote that Trump's decision to fire former FBI director James Comey did not amount to obstruction.\n\nTrump has already shown a willingness to use the Justice Department to settle political scores. As CNN previously reported , the President questioned Whitaker about the progression of the investigation against Hillary Clinton when Whitaker was Jeff Sessions' chief of staff.\n\n\"It seems very clear that the only reason that Matt Whitaker was ever appointed to this role was specifically to oversee the Mueller investigation,\" Mueller biographer Garrett Graff said on Friday in an interview on CNN's Newsroom.\n\nWith Sessions, Trump ranted publicly about how he did nothing to curtail the Mueller investigation.

A panel of judges on the 9th Circuit upheld the injunction in an opinion penned by Judge Jay Bybee, a George W. Bush nominee. That led Trump to criticize the San Francisco-based appeals court, which has blocked other administration policies such as the travel ban.\n\nThat led Roberts, who has made a public push to emphasize the independence of the judiciary from the political branches, to issue a rare statement.\n\n\"The 9th Circuit, we're going to have to look at that,\" Trump said, before adding that \"every case\" that goes through that circuit results in \"an automatic loss\" for his administration. \"The 9th Circuit is very unfair.\"\n\nThat led Roberts, who has made a public push to emphasize the independence of the judiciary from the political branches, to issue a rare statement.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.

It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' but if it is why......\" Trump tweeted.\n\nSeveral minutes later, he continued, \".....are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad. It's very bad.\"\n\nBailey's story\n\nBailey was a healthy little girl until October 28, 2014, when she suddenly couldn't move her neck or her right shoulder or leg.\n\nA rehabilitation expert at a children's hospital said Bailey wasn't really paralyzed, according to her mother, Mikell Sheehan.\n\nThe doctor said the paralysis was an emotional reaction to her sister's birth four months earlier. He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teens open up on sex to beat 'toxic' masculinity", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/QLFn9dMX3NQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) On a warm Saturday afternoon, more than a dozen young men and teenage boys sit on plastic chairs in a yard in their neighborhood.\n\nThey gather to talk about women, respect -- and sex.\n\nIt's a meeting that occurs twice a week in Pankop, a small town in Mpumalanga province, in eastern South Africa.\n\nSome of these young men are virgins, and the group's head, Kabelo Chabalala, is at pains to emphasize that it is OK to be one.\n\n\"There's a lot of toxic masculinity,\" Chabalala, 27, told CNN of the stereotypes portrayed around masculine gender roles in his country.\n\nHe believes that some of this is down to many young men in South Africa growing up without good role models.\n\n\"I realized that growing up without a father figure in my life could have influenced me to make some bad decisions,\" Chabalala said. Many of these young boys \"don't have fathers that are present.\"\n\n\"We see quite a lot of femicide [killing of a woman or girl] in South Africa,\" he explained. The global rate of femicide for 2015 was 2.4 per 100,000 women. In comparison, South Africa's rate for the same year was 9.6 per 100,000 women according to a 2018 report by Statistics South Africa\n\n\"I thought that maybe if we work on how boys and men are socializing, we can have a different generation of men,\" he added. \"Instead of complaining, one could do something positive.\"\n\nYMM members discuss sex during a meeting in Pankop, Mpumalanga province, in South Africa.\n\nIn 2015, Chabalala launched the Young Men Movement, a nonprofit support group creating safe spaces for men to talk about their feelings.\n\nMembers participate in open discussions designed to restore \"a safe environment for women,\" he says. This involves having open debates around self-awareness, exploring how the men behave and how they carry themselves. They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ...

That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year.

That can be for blood or bone marrow transplants in patients who have cancer or blood or immune system disorders.\n\nSome practitioners believe that stem cells can \"sense the environment into which they are introduced and address whatever functions require replacement or repair,\" FDA scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2017, but that \"is not based on scientific evidence.\" These stem cell treatments need to go through the appropriate clinical trials to prove that they work and are safe.\n\nThe FDA warned the public about the unapproved use of stem cell treatments in 2017, saying \"unscrupulous providers\" may promise that stem cells can be \"miracle treatments\" for just about any disease or medical condition, but not to believe \"the hype.\" At the time, Gottlieb called them \"dangerously dubious products.\"\n\nThe patients infected in this outbreak got the stem cell treatments for ailments that include general pain, osteoarthritis, back pain, a rotator cuff tear with a cyst and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAccording to Thursday's CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the first infections were reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services on September 17.

This is up from 189.4 pounds and 163.8 pounds, respectively, in 1999-2000.\n\nBlack men, Mexican-American women and Asian men and women were the only groups in the report that did not show a significant increase in weight over that period.\n\nBMI, a formula involving height and weight , also increased. In 2015-16, the average BMI was 29.1 for men and 29.6 for women. Both numbers have increased since 1999-2000 when they were 27.8 in men and 28.2 in women.\n\nAmericans' average BMI \"is now almost 30 which is the cutoff for obesity,\" Ogden noted.

For women, the measurement went from 92.2 centimeters (36.3 inches) to 98 centimeters (38.6 inches).\n\nWhile weight is going up, height is going down.

It increased until 2003-04, when the average height was 176.4 centimeters (5 feet, 9.4 inches), and then decreased again until 2015-16, when it was 175.4 centimeters (5 feet, 9.1 inches).\n\nThe report uses data from 47,233 Americans over the age of 20, gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2016.\n\nOgden noted that for weight, waist circumference and BMI, the \"biggest increases between 1999-2000 and 2015-2016 were in Mexican American adults.\"\n\nFor Mexican-American women, average body weight did not start changing until the 2009-10 period, and then it jumped from 161.6 pounds to 172 pounds in 2015-16, according to the report.\n\nMichael Long , an assistant professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University, wrote in an email that \"By focusing on changes in average BMI, this study shows that the problem of excess weight gain is impacting everyone, not just the 4 out of 10 adults with obesity.

improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida.\n\nThe procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April.\n\nMore than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.\n\nIt often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties.\n\nThe condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nSpinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London.\n\nIn the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure.\n\nIt is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nKate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nMore than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.\n\nLouise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: \"We're delighted

\"failing the public\" and is calling for taxes on unhealthy food high in sugar and salt.\n\nChief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for

Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier.\n\nThis means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said.\n\nBased on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said\n\nDame Sally said \"industry had not delivered\" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more.\n\n\"Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,\" her report says.\n\nShe hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.\n\nBut she recognised this was \"a dream\".\n\nThe report recommends:\n\nextending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks\n\na ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food\n\nmore ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011\n\ntaxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start\n\nincentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables\n\nAnd it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities.\n\nDame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer.\n\nShe said she would be accused of being \"chief nanny\" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a \"dream\"\n\n\"We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,\" Dame Sally said.\n\n\"It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school.\"\n\nThe report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made.\n\n'Wrong-headed legislation'\n\nA spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry \"fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes\".\n\nKate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade.\n\nBut she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight.\n\n\"Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.\n\n\"It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined.\"\n\nAnd she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour.\n\n\"Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a33.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management

But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP.

They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\n\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\n\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected,\n\n\"There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,\" she said.\n\nProf Stokes-Lampard said: \"There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed.\"\n\nAnd Dr Mahtani said: \"How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them.\n\n\"And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm.\"\n\nAre all practices affected?\n\nNo - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs.\n\n\"All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a domino effect.

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Charity Notes Even One Dollar Can Help A Needy Child But You\u2019d Have To Be A Dick To Give That Little", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/charity-notes-even-one-dollar-can-help-a-needy-child-bu-1831264088", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "LONDON\u2014Noting that making a difference would cost less than a single cup of coffee, the Against Malaria Foundation released an advertising campaign Friday stressing that even one dollar could help a needy child, but you\u2019d have to be a complete fucking dick to give that little. \u201cFor just one dollar out of your paycheck, you could help make sure no child has to experience this horrible disease, although what kind of a callous prick would you be to send us one measly buck?\u201d said the commercial\u2019s voiceover, explaining that any contribution was appreciated in this season of giving, but, that you would need to be a real heartless fuck of a Scrooge to look at how fortunate you are this Christmas and how little these children have and decide one-hundred pennies was the most you could possibly spare. \u201cEvery cent counts, of course.

Hass has spent much of her career living and reporting from Gaza and the West Bank - one of the only Israeli journalists to have done so. Below is the full transcript of our interview with her.\n\nThe Listening Post: \"The general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know\". That is Noam Chomsky's pithy summary of the general public's understanding of what decisions are being made on their behalves. How true does this ring to you today?\n\nAmira Hass: This is a very humanist and optimistic statement. The belief that people want to have access to information and with this access to information, they may act, may change. I can say that this kind of approach has been guiding many people like me.\n\nIn Hebrew, the words knowledge, information and awareness are all made of the same root. And this is how I started working in Gaza in the early 90s and writing about Gaza, thinking that the Israeli public knew nothing about the occupation and what it means; about Gazan life.\n\nI expected my reporting to reach others and to change awareness. I realised quite soon that this was not the case.\n\nNoam Chomsky himself has said that when he writes about Israeli policies he relies to a large extent on information published in the Israeli press which never really covered the magnitude of Israeli policies and repression.\n\nUntil the Oslo Agreement, there was a relative exposure in Israel even in the mainstream media. But this did not change people's consciences. And this is even worse today when we have a plethora of media in the era of internet. This information is out there - from activists, from human rights organisations, it's all there in the open. But the people do not pick it up. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.\n\nThe Listening Post: Chomsky claimed that journalists are not normally kept under control through top-down intervention, but by \"the selection of right-thinking personnel and by the editors' and working journalists' internalisation of priorities and definitions of news-worthiness that conform to the institution's policy\". In your experience, how is this played out when covering the Israeli occupation?\n\nHass: This is what every writer feels. Every journalist realises very quickly that you have a chain of filters while you write your piece. They could be very benign issues. Like, the length, the time, the deadline. You have 300 words. No, you have 400 words.\n\nBut somebody decides how many words you will have for an item. Somebody will decide if it's on the front page or somewhere in the cellar of the paper. Or at the end of the news read on the radio or TV.\n\nSo who decides about the hierarchy? What is important? What is not important? Who decides what is investigative journalism and what is not?\n\nVery often, I realise that if you have information that is official, this is called investigative journalism. But if you actually get information from the people themselves - let's say about the dangers of a water contamination in Gaza, this is not seen as serious as when it comes from an official.\n\nThe Listening Post: \"Censorship is largely self-censorship\" - reporters accept and internalise the constraints imposed by the market and by the powerful on them. Talk to us about when you realised this to be true and how that knowledge has affected you, inspired you, frustrated you.\n\nHass: In Israel, journalists don't live under state censorship, yet. There is military censorship but that has never seriously affected my work. But there is socialisation. You see it in Israeli mainstream media which dedicates less and less space and attention to the realities of occupation.\n\nThis has gotten worse since the Oslo Accord. It allowed people to think the occupation as non-existent. 'Oh, they have the Accords now. There is a Palestinian government. There is no occupation. Actually, there is only Palestinian terror against us.' So people are even less willing access information that exists and most of the Israeli mass media listens to the public, listens to this wish not to know.\n\nThe Listening Post: In his book, Chomsky claimed that the \"societal purpose of the media is to inculcate and defend the economic, social and political agenda of privileged groups that dominate the domestic society and the state\" and they do that through the selection of topics, framing of issues, filtering of information and by keeping debate within \"the bounds of the acceptable\" in the media. Can you talk to us about coming up against the \"bounds of the acceptable\" in the context you work in?\n\nHass: I'm lucky to have worked at an Israeli paper whose publisher and owner is liberal in the true sense of the word and which is also strongly against the Israeli occupation. So I have the freedom that I think that my colleagues who cover this in other papers and other media, who might be also against Israeli policies don't have the freedom that I have.\n\nI guess that coming from, from the left wing, my family, my background, I've become used to being rejected. But I have persisted and I'm also lucky because there is a very important, not too big but very determined community of activists and Israeli activists against the occupation and against Israeli policies in general, Israeli colonialist policies - maybe that is a bit better term than occupation.\n\nThe Listening Post: It's 30 years since Manufacturing Consent was published. Why is it still relevant today?\n\nHass: They are relevant, the book and the concept are relevant because they offer to every journalist and they offer a kind of a lighthouse. They are relevant because we see how tycoons have taken over more and more, over the years, more and more media, media corporations and media venues.\n\nNews that is deemed fit to print is not necessarily the news that is beneficial for the people and for the public. So the book invokes people's scepticism and this is always important. Though, as I said before, the problem today that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest. And this is a very sad realisation.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Baghdad's Green Zone opens its gates to public after 15 years", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/baghdad-green-zone-opens-gates-public-15-years-181221225208710.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "For fifteen years most Iraqis have been unable to access the heart of Baghdad b ut the tall concrete walls and barbed wire that have closed off the Green Zone for years, are finally coming down.\n\nThe Green Zone, a 10 square kilometer area in central Baghdad, has been partially open to the public since December 10 for a two-week trial period that is likely to become permanent.\n\nCars are now allowed to traverse the area from 5pm to 1am along the 14th of July Road, a key thoroughfare that extends from the 14th July Bridge - also known as the hanging bridge - and connects the city's east and west.\n\nSide roads where Iraqi officials are based remain closed however, and government buildings and foreign missions continue to be under heavy security and surveillance.\n\nFollowing the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the neighborhood was cordoned off by the US military, which set up its headquarters there, at Saddam Hussein's former palace. As the area later hosted the US embassy and Iraqi parliament, the Green Zone became a symbol of the US occupation and the estrangement felt by many Iraqis towards their government.\n\nThis led Baghdad residents to receive the move with celebrations. Iraqi flags were seen hanging from car windows, as families cheer on the government while entering the once heavily fortified area. And yet, Iraqis hope more will be done to bring Bagdad back to its former self.\n\nFestive atmosphere\n\nThe reopening, ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, coincided with the first anniversary of Baghdad's victory over the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [ISIL], the armed group that had overtaken large swathes of the country since 2014.\n\n\"This is a reason for real celebration,\" said Adnan Qureishi, a journalist and Baghdad resident. \"The area has an important place in our memory. It had been under occupation by the Americans and the government for too long.\"\n\nHassan Jaber, a professor at Baghdad University, who has been driving along the previously closed off thoroughfare for several days, feels equally elated by the move.\n\n\"It's a double celebration of a big achievement [victory over ISIL] and brave move [reopening of the Green Zone],\" Jaber told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"For 15 years this area has been off limits. A whole generation has never seen it,\" he added, explaining that the last time he traversed the area was in 2003.\n\n\"We just hope the reopening will extend to all roads, old palaces and former government buildings too.\"\n\nRelieving Baghdad's traffic problem\n\nLong-neglected road networks in the city of almost nine million residents make movement across Baghdad difficult, and traffic jams ubiquitous.\n\nBut with two of the capital's key thoroughfares - Haifa Street and 14th of July Boulevard - traversing the Green Zone, the reopening has reduced some of Baghdad's heavy road congestion.\n\n\"The reopening, even if partial, has brought our city a sense of relief,\" Ammar Waleed, spokesperson for the Iraqi traffic police told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Most residents in Baghdad are finding transit across the city easier now,\" he added.\n\nSalah Mahdi, a taxi driver and Baghdad resident, agrees but says a real impact will only be felt once all gates to the zone are reopened around the clock.\n\n\"This is definitely a positive change. But these roads need to be opened during rush hour. That would make a real difference,\" said Mahdi.\n\nGovernment promises\n\nSeveral Iraqi leaders had pledged to reopen the central zone since the US military withdrew from Iraq in 2011, but their promises were never realised.\n\nAfter the government reopened the Green Zone in 2015 for a few days, it closed it again following opposition from officials over security concerns.\n\nThe presence of government buildings, residences of several high-level officials, various international organisation, such as the UN, and foreign embassies - most notably the US embassy's expansive complex - have established security concerns as a longstanding issue.\n\nDespite the barriers and checkpoints, the area has remained a target. In 2004, a suicide bombing killed dozens of Americans, while a year later, an Iraqi legislator was killed in another attack on the parliament. Followers of Iraqi Shia religious leader Muqtada al-Sadr targeted the area with rockets several times in 2008. And in 2016, anti-corruption protesters stormed the Green Zone, bringing the government to a standstill.\n\nThe area has an important place in our memory. It's been under occupation by the Americans and the government for too long. Adnan Qureshi, journalist and Baghdad resident\n\nAlthough there are no guarantees the reopening will be permanent, there are promising signs the government will keep its word on the matter this time.\n\n\"It's definitely different this time. The government has made a real promise and the threat of ISIL is no longer present,\" said Hakeem Abdul Zahraa, spokesperson for the Baghdad mayoralty.\n\nFor several weeks ahead of the move, the mayoralty has worked with the Iraqi security forces to lift kilometres of blast walls across the Green Zone. They have also dismantled several checkpoints which previously only allowed people with biometric badges and vehicle passes to enter.\n\n\"For weeks now we've been working. We've removed a lot of the blast walls, but lots more are yet to be taken down,\" said Abdul Zahraa.\n\nAccording to Abdul Zahraa, the government will definitely complete the process, but a gradual approach is necessary.\n\n\"Road works need to be completed, traffic lights fixed, and tunnels that had been deserted for years, made safe to use again,\" Abul Zahraa told Jazeera. \"All that will take time and must be done over stages.\"\n\nThe US embassy in Baghdad had not responded to an invitation to comment on the Green Zone reopening by the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt did not make any official statements on the move except to warn, in a security alert, residents in Baghdad to remain indoors on the night of the reopening.\n\nAccording to Mamoon Alabbasi, a political analyst focusing on the Middle East and North Africa, despite the presence of security concerns, the government is unlikely to go back on its word.\n\n\"Abdul Mahdi will go through the reopening, or as much as he can of it. Security concerns and possible pressure from officials remain. But that's why the reopening has been partial,\" he explained.\n\nCosmetic change?\n\nIn addition to opening up the area, Abdul Mahdi relocated his offices out of the fortified enclave on the first day of his term in late October, saying that he wanted to bring his government closer to the people and for Iraqis to consider \"all of Iraq a Green Zone\".\n\nBut with frustrations over chronic power cuts and water pollution prompting large protests across Iraq's southern provinces in recent months, analysts believe this move may not be enough to calm the public.\n\n\"The reopening of Green Zone has made Abdul Mahdi more popular, but it is a cosmetic change of sorts. The real problems are still there and people in Basra are fuming over the lack of policy change,\" said Alabbasi."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Somalia: Deadly blasts rock Mogadishu near presidential palace", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/somalia-deadly-blasts-rock-capital-mogadishu-181222072011626.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Two explosions have hit Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, killing at least six people, local media reported.\n\nThe first car bomb detonated at a checkpoint near the national theatre, sending thick white smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nThe second explosion took place just minutes after, reportedly in the same area.\n\nMohamed Bulbul, a journalist based in Mogadishu, told Al Jazeera that Mohamed Tulah, the Deputy Governor for security in Somalia's Benadir region, was wounded in the first blast.\n\n\"Government officials are stationed near the area and it is a very guarded place.

I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.\"\n\nWry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.\n\nHarsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.\n\nFor many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.\n\nThe book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.\n\nIn the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.\n\nIn that way, the book continues to resonate.\n\nBut like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?\n\nWe spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.\n\nThe first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: \"the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know\".\n\n\"This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,\" she responded. \"The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.\"\n\nHass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?\n\n\"Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,\" she said, with resignation, \"and this is a very sad realisation.\"\n\nAman Sethi put it like this:\n\n\"It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The son of peasants, Liu built a Beijing electronics shop into JD.com, China\u2019s biggest online direct retailer, selling everything from clothes to toys to fresh vegetables.\n\nHe has continued to lead the company since his arrest.\n\nThe announcement on Liu comes at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and the arrest of another prominent Chinese tech executive.\n\nChina reacted angrily after Canadian authorities, at the behest of the U.S., arrested Huawei Technologies\u2019 Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on Dec. 1.\n\nThe U.S. reportedly wants her extradited to face allegations the company evaded U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.\n\nWarner, who previously criticized the president's executive order for failing to lay out strong, clear consequences for election meddling, said it was no surprise China and Iran tried to manipulate American voters, and that the problem will only get worse.\n\n\"We're going to see more and more adversaries trying to take advantage of the openness of our society to sow division and attempt to manipulate Americans,\" he added. \"Congress has to step up and enact some much-needed guardrails on social media, and companies need to work with us so that we can update our laws to better protect against attacks on our democracy.\"\n\nExecutive order praised\n\nFormer officials have urged patience, praising the executive order as a good start and cautioning it will take time to see how well it works.\n\n\"I don't know that it will be a complete solution,\" said Sean Kanuck, a former intelligence officer for cyber issues, said when the order was first introduced. \"I doubt it will completely change the incentive-cost-benefit analysis of the other side.\"\n\nEven after the executive order was unveiled, U.S. officials, as well as social media companies, continued to turn up evidence that Russia and others tried to meddle in the 2018 U.S. midterm election.\n\nIn October, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment against 44-year-old Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, charging her with helping to finance disinformation campaigns on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, targeting both Republican and Democratic voters.\n\nAs with previous efforts, the accounts were designed to make it appear as though they belonged to American political activists and some managed to generate tens of thousands of followers.\n\nLater that month, Facebook said it had removed 82 accounts, pages or groups from its site and from Instagram that originated in Iran and targeted liberal U.S. voters.\n\nBut U.S. officials and experts have also warned that the heavy focus on social media and influence campaigns, and the lack of evidence of tampering with U.S. voting systems and databases, should not be seen as a victory.\n\nSaving 'best tricks for 2020'\n\nThey say that just as the U.S. has hardened its systems against attacks and intrusions, cyber adversaries like Russia have been watching and learning, with their eyes perhaps on a much more significant target.\n\n\"The Russians were going to save their best tricks for 2020,\" said William Carter, deputy director, Technology Policy Program, Center for Strategic and International Studies, predicted in the days before the U.S. midterm elections in November.\n\n\"They're going to let us chase our tails in 2018 and look for them where they're not,\" he added."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Partial Government Shutdown Appears Likely as US House Adjourns", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/partial-government-shutdown-appears-likely-as-us-house-adjourns/4711870.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "As U.S. Senate leaders continued negotiating funding for border security measures, a partial government shutdown seemed all but assured as the U.S. House of Representatives adjourned late Friday.\n\nLawmakers have until midnight in Washington to enact a spending bill or portions of the federal government will close.\n\nBut with the House voting to adjourn until noon Saturday, it appeared that operations for about a quarter of the government would cease early Saturday, meaning more than 800,000 federal employees' jobs would be disrupted, and more than half of those employees would be required to work without pay.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that while talks were continuing among lawmakers and with the White House, no deal on a spending bill had yet been reached to avert the problem.\n\nEarlier Friday, the Senate had voted to advance a House-passed bill that included $5 billion for President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall.

General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!\"\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters late Thursday that Trump and Mattis are on good terms despite not agreeing on foreign policy and other issues.\n\n\n\n\"He and the president have a good relationship, but sometimes they disagree,\" Sanders said. \"That doesn't mean you don't have a good relationship with somebody. He was laying out the reasons he was stepping down from his post.\"\n\n\n\nStill, the resignation has sparked an outpouring of anger and despair from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, and even top U.S. officials.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was deeply saddened,\u201d U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in an official statement Friday, describing Mattis as a \"national treasure.\"\n\n\n\n\"The experience and sound judgement that Secretary Mattis has brought to our decision-making process is invaluable,\u201d Coats continued. \u201cHis leadership of our military won the admiration of our troops and respect of our allies and adversaries.\"\n\n\n\nMuch of the pushback from U.S. officials and lawmakers has centered on the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the fight against the Islamic State terror group in Syria \u2013 a decision that, according to some officials, ultimately convinced Mattis to resign.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.-backed forces have made steady progress against Islamic State over the past several years. Last week, taking advantage of a dramatic increase in U.S. and coalition airstrikes, the forces were able to enter the town of Hajin, part of the terror group\u2019s last stronghold in eastern Syria.\n\n\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s declaration of victory against IS, senior administration officials have said it will be up to the U.S. partner forces to liberate the rest of Hajin and the surrounding areas, where about 2,000 IS fighters have been mounting a stubborn last stand for several months.\n\n\n\nPentagon officials have also warned that despite the gains, IS was still well-positioned to rebuild. And Mattis had said that before leaving, the U.S. must train enough local troops to assume the role of suppressing the militants. He said the United Nations peace process in Syria must progress toward a resolution of the country\u2019s eight-year-old civil war.\n\n\n\nWhile a relatively small number of troops are involved, their withdrawal will have sweeping consequences in Syria's long-running civil war. Allies will be more heavily burdened with confronting energized adversaries and Turkey, Iran and Russia's influence in Syria will increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is scary,\" said Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat. \"Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.\"\n\n\n\nRepublican senator and former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio tweeted, \"It makes it abundantly clear that we are headed toward a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage our alliances and empower our adversaries.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the decision to pull out of Syria may have been the last straw for Mattis, tensions have been simmering over other issues for quite some time, including on Russia and Iran.\n\n\n\nMattis believed Russian President Vladimir Putin has been trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies.\n\n\n\n\"[Putin's] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,\" Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Trump has praised Putin's leadership skills and recently caused concern among U.S. allies by calling for Russia's reinstatement in the group of major industrial nations. Russia was expelled from what was then the Group of Eight after Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\n\n\nAnother point of contention between the two men involved the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\n\nMattis argued the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the agreement. Iran was following the pact's rules, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy and has verified Iranian compliance with the accord multiple times since 2015.\n\n\n\nDespite Mattis's position, Trump pulled out of the deal in May, saying it had been poorly negotiated during the administration of former President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nAs Mattis turned in his resignation, the Defense Department was preparing plans to withdraw up to half of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan in the coming months, U.S. officials said. The development marks a sharp departure from the Trump administration's policy to force the Taliban to the negotiating table after more than 17 years of war.\n\n\n\n\n\nRumors of Mattis leaving the Defense Department have been circulating for months.\n\n\n\nIn October, Trump appeared on the television news show 60 Minutes, where he told TV anchor Lesley Stahl that while \"I like General Mattis,\" he believed he knew more about NATO than his defense secretary.\n\n\n\n\"I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth,\" Trump said. \"But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.\"\n\n\n\nMattis became secretary of defense shortly after Trump's inauguration and is one of the longest-serving Cabinet members.\n\n\n\nBefore that, Mattis served 44 years in the Marine Corps and led the Marines and British troops during the bloody Battle of Fallujah in Iraq in 2004."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Most Babies Born With Cleft Condition Could Die Without Surgery", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/most-babies-born-with-cleft-condition-could-die-without-surgery/4711475.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "One of the most common birth defects in the world is a cleft lip.

But if we don\u2019t do the research, we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019\n\nConcerns over \u201ctheoretical harm\u201d drive decisions to exclude pregnant women from interventions, Krubiner said. But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities.

Jam their signals, others suggested.\n\nExperts say it's not that easy.\n\nBritain and the U.S. prohibit drones from being flown too high or too close to airports and other aircraft. In Britain, it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nStill, there is little to stop a drone operator bent on disrupting air traffic, which British officials say was the case with the Gatwick incident that began Wednesday evening.\n\nThe number of close calls between drones and aircraft has increased dramatically in recent years as the popularity of drones has soared. Basic models for amateurs sell for under $100; larger, more sophisticated ones can cost hundreds more.\n\nBritain had 120 reports of close encounters in 2018, up from 93 last year. In 2014, there were six, according to the U.K. Airprox Board, which catalogs air safety incidents.\n\nIn the United States, there were nearly 2,300 drone sightings at airports in the year ending June 30, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Runways have been temporarily closed, but an FAA spokesman said he could not recall drones ever leading to the shutdown of a U.S. airport.\n\nDrone dangers\n\nA drone hit a small charter plane in Canada in 2017; it landed safely. In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones. It wasn't clear what brand was used in the Gatwick incident.\n\nBritish authorities are planning to tighten regulations by requiring drone users to register, which could make it easier to identify the pilot. U.S. law already requires users to register their drones and get certified as pilots.\n\nBut Wagner warned: \"If somebody wants to do something really bad, he will never register.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "DC Sues Facebook Over Cambridge Analytica's Data Use", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/dc-sues-facebook-over-cambridge-analytica-s-data-use/4708039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "The attorney general for Washington, D.C., said Wednesday that the nation's capital had sued Facebook over reports involving Cambridge Analytica's use of data from the social media giant.\n\n\"Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data and how it was used,\" Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. \"Facebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other third-party applications to collect personal data without users' permission.\"\n\nThe lawsuit came as Facebook faced new reports that it shared its users' data without their permission.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign at one point, gained access to personal data from tens of millions of Facebook's users.

It is used by Muslims to denote items that fit within various Islamic requirements, such as restrictions against the pork-based gelatin found in some candies.

This is the choice and the decision of the whole church.\u201d\n\nMondadori Portfolio via Getty Images Pope Francis and the Roman Curia during the Christmas greetings at Clementine Hall in Vatican City on Friday. The pope addressed the Roman Catholic Church's sexual abuse crisis in his remarks.\n\nThe pope\u2019s message comes at the end of one of the toughest years of his papacy. Francis started off the year by passionately defending a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse of minors, dismissing the testimony of abuse survivors as \u201cslander.\u201d Months later, he admitted he made \u201cgrave errors\u201d in his handling of Chile\u2019s abuse crisis.\n\nLater in the year, the crisis in the U.S. reached a fever pitch after a Pennsylvania grand jury published a devastating report into sexual abuse in the state that identified 301 predator priests and more than 1,000 victims. The report has sparked similar attempts by state prosecutors around the country.\n\nJust this week, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan released a damning report accusing the Catholic Church in Illinois of withholding the names of at least 500 priests accused of abuse.\n\nMadigan\u2019s preliminary report concludes that her state\u2019s Catholic dioceses are incapable of investigating themselves and \u201cwill not resolve the clergy sexual abuse crisis on their own.\u201d\n\nThe pope has also been beset this year by accusations from a Vatican insider that Francis and others in the hierarchy were complicit in covering up abuse carried out by former American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Francis has not directly responded to the claims he was complicit, which are still unsubstantiated.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Francis said February's bishops' summit on sexual abuse will address protecting children, bringing healing to victims and improving training in seminaries.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the pope has called for a bishops\u2019 summit on sexual abuse in February, which will be attended by the heads of about 110 national Catholic bishops\u2019 conferences, the leaders of religious orders and abuse experts, Reuters reports.\n\nOn Friday, Francis said the summit will address how to protect children, bring healing to the victims, and improve training on the issue in seminaries. He vowed to turn \u201cpast mistakes\u201d on handling the crisis into \u201copportunities for eliminating this scourge\u201d in the church and in broader society.\n\nFrancis also thanked journalists for highlighting the voices of Catholic victims. At the same time, he emphasized that the Catholic Church isn\u2019t the only institution dealing with sexual abuse cases.\n\n\u201cIf this grave tragedy has involved some consecrated ministers, we can ask how deeply rooted it may be in our societies and in our families,\u201d Francis said. \u201cConsequently, the church will not be limited to healing her own wounds, but will seek to deal squarely with this evil that causes the slow death of so many persons, on the moral, psychological and human levels.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Francis emphasized in his remarks to the Roman Curia on Friday that the Catholic Church isn't the only institution dealing with sexual abuse cases.\n\nGiven the church\u2019s dismal track record on policing itself in the past, abuse survivors and their advocates were skeptical about Francis\u2019 new comments on the crisis.\n\nAnne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the abuse tracking website Bishop-Accountability.org, told HuffPost she thinks the pope is \u201cindulging in make-believe and misdirection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn commanding child molesters to turn themselves in, Francis is pretending.

But Maus\u2019 testimony inspired hundreds of other people to come forward with similar stories of abuse. Faria was arrested Sunday, just nine days after Maus went public with her accusation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really relieved to know how many women came forward,\u201d Maus told Brazilian news site G1. \u201cI have a positive feeling, because it was the reason I decided to give an interview for the first time. It was to open the door for the first time to all the women and girls who suffer abuse to present themselves. And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nA task force created to investigate Faria had received 506 reports of abuse as of Monday, HuffPost Brazil reports. In Brazil, the flood of allegations against Faria is being compared to the wave of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was first publicly accused of sex crimes last year.\n\nThe speed of the investigation, which led to Faria turning himself in to authorities, is an example of the collective power of women and the importance of reporting abuse, said Maira Pinheiro, a lawyer and member of the Feminist Jurist Network.\n\nMaira Zapater, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Crime and Punishment in S\u00e3o Paulo, told HuffPost Brazil that the similarity in the allegations against Faria has been crucial. One of the main difficulties prosecutors face when investigating sex crimes is the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.\n\nBut 12 women have shared their stories publicly since Maus first spoke out, and their accounts have been too similar for skeptics to dismiss. They have described a pattern of abuse that began with them visiting Faria\u2019s healing center in search of cures for personal problems. They said Faria invited them to a private consultation after an initial meeting, which is when the abuse, masked as \u201ctreatment,\u201d began.\n\nMaus described a similar scenario in her TV appearance. She said the \u201ctreatment\u201d culminated in Faria raping her at his healing center four years ago.\n\nShe said she kept the allegation to herself because she was worried she\u2019d be persecuted by Faria\u2019s followers and because she believed \u201che was curing thousands of people.\u201d\n\nApart from being relevant in the production of data, reporting is also relevant because it removes the victim from that position of, \u2018I\u2019m not sure what happened\u2019 or \u2018I must be crazy.\u2019 Maira Pinheiro, a lawyer and member of the Feminist Jurist Network\n\nZapater said it is common for survivors of sexual violence to keep quiet.\n\n\u201cWe still often see women who are afraid to go to police stations for fear of having their word questioned, since they cannot present any materials proving the violence they have suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a failure that is not even discussed in current legal courses. Professionals come to deal with these situations completely unprepared, and often these women are embarrassed.\u201d\n\nWhy Reporting Matters\n\nFailure to report abuse leads to impunity and tolerance for gender-based violence, as well as to inaccurate statistics, experts say.\n\nIn Brazil, for example, more than 60,000 cases of violence against women were reported in 2017. That figure jumps to 500,000 when underreporting is taken into account.\n\n\u201cReporting is important so that the state and society can investigate the reasons why crimes against women still occur, how they occur and against whom they occur,\u201d Pinheiro said. \u201cBut apart from being relevant in the production of data, reporting is also relevant because it removes the victim from that position of, \u2018I\u2019m not sure what happened\u2019 or \u2018I must be crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nEVARISTO SA via Getty Images Followers of Faria pray at his \"healing center\" on Dec. 12.\n\nSurvivors sometimes struggle with self-doubt and believe abusers who try to convince them the violence was warranted, Pinheiro said. It is this sort of \u201crape culture,\u201d she added, that results in victims struggling to comprehend \u201cthat what happened to them is, in fact, a crime.\u201d\n\nPinheiro also said Brazil needs to do more to help people who report sexual and gender-based violence, including guaranteeing them access to health and social services as well as financial autonomy programs.

It was the first official comment by the group on Trump\u2019s surprise announcement.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria has rattled Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies, who are its most reliable partner in the country and among the most effective ground forces battling IS. With U.S. air support, the Kurds drove IS from much of northern and eastern Syria in a costly four-year campaign.\n\nThe announcement of a pullout is widely seen as an abandonment of a loyal ally.\n\n\u201cThe decision to pull out under these circumstances will lead to a state of instability and create a political and military void in the region and leave its people between the claws of enemy forces,\u201d the SDF statement said.\n\nKurdish officials and commanders met into the night, discussing their responses to the decision, local residents said Thursday. A war monitor said among the options seriously discussed was releasing thousands of Islamic State militants and their families from various nationalities who are being detained in SDF-run prisons and camps. It was not clear whether any decision was immediately taken, and SDF commanders were not immediately available for comment.\n\nArin Sheikhmos, a Kurdish journalist and commentator, said \u201cwe have every right to be afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Americans pull out and leave us to the Turks or the (Syrian) regime our destiny will be like the Kurds of Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991 \u2014 million of refugees, there will be massacres.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to launch a new offensive against the Kurds but in recent days had stepped up the rhetoric, threatening an assault could begin \u201cat any moment.\u201d\n\nTurkey views the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, the main component of the Syrian Democratic Forces, as a terrorist group and an extension of the insurgency within its borders. U.S. support for the group has strained ties between the two NATO allies.\n\nIn northeastern Syria, Kurdish fighters have been digging trenches and defensive tunnels, preparing for the threatened offensive. Turkish tanks and armored vehicles are deployed on the border, with thousands of allied Arab Syrian fighters mobilized to join in the attack.\n\nThe threat from Turkey could drive the Kurds into the arms of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and by extension Iran and Russia.\n\n\u201cThis is expected,\u201d Ebrahim Ebrahim, a Syrian Kurd based in Europe, said of the pullout. \u201cBut it is not just treason to the Kurds or the people of Syria but to democracy, to morals, if this is true. Yes, true, we fought for ourselves, but we also fought for democracies all over the world,\u201d he added.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the U.S. decision to withdraw its forces from Syria, saying he agreed with Trump that the defeat of the Islamic State group removes the need for the U.S. military presence. Russia has long held that the U.S. presence in Syria is illegitimate because it hasn\u2019t been vetted by the U.N. Security Council or approved by the Syrian government.\n\nRussia is a key ally of Assad, and its military intervention, beginning in 2015, turned the tide of the war in his favor.\n\nA Syrian member of parliament, Peter Marjana, said Thursday that a U.S. pullout would be a \u201crecognition that Syria has won.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s contention that IS has been defeated contradicted his own experts\u2019 assessments and shocked his party\u2019s lawmakers, who called his decision rash and dangerous.\n\nEarlier this month, Kurdish fighters entered Hajin, the last IS enclave in Syria, but battles continues.

Many of them fully expected Hillary Clinton to become president. Instead, they found themselves with every politico\u2019s dream: one-party control of the three branches of government.\n\n\u201cWe are going to hit the ground running,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) declared, saying Donald Trump \u201cearned a mandate\u201d to push his agenda forward as president.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change the course for America,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared.\n\nTwo years later, the Republican dream is left in shambles. And voters were clearly not impressed with what the GOP Congress accomplished with its one-party rule. In January, Democrats will take control of the House.\n\nAt midnight, the federal government partially shut down for the third time during Trump\u2019s presidency after Republicans failed in their most basic duty as lawmakers: funding government operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of a sort of meltdown on the part of the Republicans,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday. Pelosi is expected to become speaker in the new Congress.\n\nRep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), however, argued that this turmoil was normal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the state legislature for 14 years, six of those as speaker. I\u2019ve been here for 20 years,\u201d he told reporters Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it not end this way. The last week of a legislative session is ugly. Always is.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not always this ugly. When then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) retired in 2015, he cleaned up the place. He pushed through a two-year spending deal and a two-year raise in the federal borrowing limit, theoretically allowing Congress to get other things done so they wouldn\u2019t have to waste time lurching from crisis to crisis.\n\nAnd the messiness wasn\u2019t restricted to this past week.\n\nFormer Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who left Congress in 2017 and recently gave up his party affiliation, said the Republican Party\u2019s unified control of government was \u201cdefined by remarkably damaging wins and complete capitulation of separation of powers.\u201d\n\nCongress spent two years behaving as a political committee of the president, not a branch of government empowered with independence by the Constitution. Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.)\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Republicans made repealing it their rallying cry. Up until the 2018 campaign, it was their central political message. But the ACA turned out to be far more popular than they anticipated and repealing it was far harder than expected as well \u2015 despite controlling both chambers of Congress. Trump and his Republican allies continue to weaken the law, but there was no all-out repeal as promised.\n\nCongress\u2019 biggest legislative accomplishment was passing the new tax law, but it fell far short of what was promised. There were deep, permanent cuts for corporations, and a more modest cut for individuals that expires at the end of 2025. The tax bill was not as popular as Republicans expected, and they largely abandoned it as a campaign message.\n\nThe tax law also contributed to a complete abandonment of the GOP\u2019s stated concern about fiscal responsibility.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was president, Republicans hammered him on the national debt. \u201cAmerica Can\u2019t Afford Obama\u2019s Legacy Of A Skyrocketing National Debt\u201d read a typical document on the Republican National Committee\u2019s website in 2017. When the national debt was at $15 trillion in 2012, Ryan warned of the \u201cred tidal wave of debt\u201d that would mean the \u201cend of the American dream\u201d in as little as two or three years.\n\nBut it\u2019s 2018, and the national debt has grown to $21 trillion under the GOP\u2019s watch. The federal government\u2019s budget office projects the GOP\u2019s tax law will add more than $1.8 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years. So much for fiscal austerity.\n\nAssociated Press Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) tenure as House speaker will be defined less by big intellectual ideas than by partisan politics and the GOP's defense of Trump.\n\nOne bright spot for Republicans is the criminal justice reform bill that passed on a strong bipartisan basis this month. The bill is designed to help nonviolent federal offenders make an easier return to society after they\u2019ve served most of their sentences. It also trimmed a handful of mandatory minimum sentences, such as for crack cocaine, that helped explode the federal prison population over the past three decades. Most Republicans probably wouldn\u2019t have supported such a bill without cover from a president like Trump, who does \u201ctough on crime\u201d politics like it\u2019s still the 1980s.\n\nThat same macho impulse, however, is what led to the government shutdown, with Trump insisting Congress appropriate billions of dollars for a giant wall to keep \u201cbad guys\u201d from crossing the southern U.S. border. It\u2019s such a ridiculous idea that Republicans in Congress try to pretend the president\u2019s talking broadly about \u201cborder security\u201d and not a physical barrier made out of concrete or steel.\n\nRyan and McConnell could have sent the president a clean funding bill and dared him to veto it \u2015 instead, they played along with his demand and made a show of holding votes, even though it was clear Democrats wouldn\u2019t go along.\n\nAnd while Senate Republicans did push through two conservative Supreme Court nominees, they largely overlooked or dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against one: Brett Kavanaugh, who was rushed ahead for confirmation without the usual vetting.\n\nBut most notably, the Republican majority will be remembered for what it didn\u2019t do: It didn\u2019t stand up to Trump.\n\n\u201cCongress spent two years behaving as a political committee of the president, not a branch of government empowered with independence by the Constitution,\u201d Jolly said.\n\nCongress never passed legislation protecting Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign. Ryan frequently dismissed Trump\u2019s concerning rhetoric and actions \u2015 like attacking fellow Republicans or outright lying \u2015 calling it \u201cnoise\u201d or \u201ctrolling.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Trump Dramatically Shuts Down Some Agencies After Nobody Will Pay For His Wall", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shutdown-wall-blame_us_5c1d8009e4b08aaf7a88d9f1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 After two years of failing to get Mexico to pay for a border wall as he had promised, President Donald Trump forced a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday over his insistence that American taxpayers foot the bill instead.\n\nThe impulsive, not-really-thought-through move has become the norm in Trump\u2019s presidency. Whether it results in anything close to the billions he had demanded for wall construction is unclear \u2015 and may well be beside the point.\n\nAlso unclear is how long the shutdown will last. Trump\u2019s allies in the House added $5.7 billion in wall construction money onto a spending bill that had already cleared the Senate. That additional money remains a non-starter in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass controversial legislation and where there are only 51 Republicans.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has already begun blaming Democrats for forcing the shutdown, even though he himself caused it by changing his mind at the last minute and insisting that the short-term spending bill moving through Congress include an unspecified amount of money for his wall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Democrats. So it\u2019s really the Democrat shutdown,\u201d the president said Friday during an unrelated bill signing ceremony at the White House.\n\nJust 10 days earlier, though, in that same Oval Office, Trump had bragged to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that he would be happy to take the responsibility for a shutdown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Argue about a border wall or play golf? That is the question.\n\nThree-quarters of the federal government has already been funded through next September under spending bills that Trump signed previously. But a handful of major agencies received only temporary funding because of the president\u2019s earlier insistence that Congress start building his border wall, which Democrats refused to go along with.\n\nThe last of those funding extensions expired at midnight Friday. Both Trump and his White House had signaled during the first part of the week that he would accept another extension, this time through Feb. 8. By that point, Pelosi will have been sworn in as the new speaker, since the Democratic Party picked up 40 House seats in the midterm elections.\n\nSome Trump allies believe that he will have an easier time negotiating a longer-term deal with her, offering to agree to some Democratic priorities in return for his wall. Other observers think that he has always preferred to attack Democrats over the lack of a wall than to actually build one, so that a Pelosi speakership will wind up being useful to him politically.\n\nAll those calculations changed Thursday morning, though, following a night and a morning of harsh criticism from Fox News hosts and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Trump announced that he would reject any short-term spending bill that did not offer more money for border security, although he did not specific an amount.\n\nBuilding a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trump\u2019s singular campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times between June 2015 and Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.\n\nThe \u201cforcing Mexico to pay\u201d part, though, was quietly dropped almost immediately upon his taking office. In a phone call with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mexico\u2019s president at the time, Trump said that he understood Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has been conflating the \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d made of reinforced concrete that he promised during his campaign with a \u201cbollard fence\u201d design of steel posts that was adopted and started during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nOf late, he has suggested describing his wall as \u201cartistically designed steel slats\u201d so Democrats won\u2019t object to it as vociferously.\n\nThe shutdown will have little effect through the weekend and even on Monday, Christmas Eve, and Tuesday, Christmas Day, which are both federal holidays. But non-essential employees at the affected departments will be furloughed starting Wednesday, while employees considered essential \u2015 including Trump\u2019s Secret Service detail and many tens of thousands of workers in the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard \u2015 will be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Government Grinding To A Halt As Border Wall Impasse Triggers Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/partial-government-shutdown-border-wall-funding_us_5c1d27cbe4b0407e907aaab3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 White House officials reached out to federal agencies late Friday night with instructions to prepare for an orderly shutdown.

But such legislation would be doomed in the Senate, where Republicans wouldn\u2019t be able to secure the required 60 votes \u2015 or potentially even 50 votes.\n\nThe Senate spent hours Friday holding a vote open, hoping that more GOP senators would come back to D.C. and agree to consider a bill passed by the House that contained money for a border wall. Eventually, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) switched his vote and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) voted yes to tie the vote at 47-47. Pence then broke the tie, allowing the Senate to proceed to the House-passed bill.\n\nBut Corker and Flake said they supported the motion with the understanding that the next thing the Senate votes on would not be the House legislation with wall money. \u201cThere is no path forward for the House bill,\u201d Flake flatly declared.\n\nInstead, the Senate intends to continue negotiating and not hold a vote on anything else until there is an agreement between Republicans, Democrats, the House, the Senate and the White House.\n\nMcCarthy said the House wouldn\u2019t be back until the Senate had acted in some way, meaning Republicans don\u2019t plan on folding and passing the clean continuing resolution that passed the Senate unanimously earlier this week.\n\nRepublicans are now holding out for something \u2015 even if it\u2019s a face-saving deal.\n\nEven if lawmakers do strike a compromise \u2015 such as giving Trump the original $1.6 billion for border security (but not a wall), which Democrats had offered weeks ago \u2015 it\u2019s unlikely House conservatives would go for it. That means Trump may have to sign a bill without the support of a majority of the House GOP conference.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear at this point if House Democrats would support such a compromise \u2015 an even more pressing question since they might be expected to supply the majority of the votes to pass a deal.\n\nAt this point, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any easy agreement in the immediate offing. The weekend is starting and federal workers have Monday and Tuesday off for Christmas holidays, but a shutdown could extend past Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has so far refused a vote on the clean continuing resolution, but he could likely get that bill to the president\u2019s desk if he allowed one.\n\nThat bill, which would continue current spending on the remaining unfunded agencies through Feb. 8, does not include wall money, and Trump has said he won\u2019t sign it. But as the political and practical effects of a shutdown become real \u2015 furloughed workers, missed paychecks for government employees and contractors \u2015 it\u2019s still possible for Trump to punt again on this fight.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible this shutdown could last indefinitely.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t shown much willingness to cave since he indicated to House leaders that he wouldn\u2019t sign a bill without border wall funding, and he\u2019s been emboldened by a successful House vote to add $5.7 billion in funding for the wall.\n\nThe shutdown will affect about 25 percent of government agencies, including Homeland Security, Justice, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture and State. It will stop the pay of around 800,000 government employees and contractors.\n\nMost of the government has already secured funding through the year, with the Pentagon, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services all getting their funding through an earlier appropriations bill this year. Their operations \u2014 along with the legislative branch\u2019s \u2014 won\u2019t be impacted. Others, such as the federal courts, have secured temporary funding to keep them open for several weeks in the event of a shutdown.\n\nBut for the federal workers affected by this shutdown, this could be a painful lapse in appropriations.

So it\u2019s really the Democrat shutdown,\u201d the president said Friday during an unrelated bill signing ceremony at the White House.\n\nJust 10 days earlier, though, in that same Oval Office, Trump had bragged to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that he would be happy to take the responsibility for a shutdown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Argue about a border wall or play golf? That is the question.\n\nThree-quarters of the federal government has already been funded through next September under spending bills that Trump signed previously. But a handful of major agencies received only temporary funding because of the president\u2019s earlier insistence that Congress start building his border wall, which Democrats refused to go along with.\n\nThe last of those funding extensions expired at midnight Friday. Both Trump and his White House had signaled during the first part of the week that he would accept another extension, this time through Feb. 8. By that point, Pelosi will have been sworn in as the new speaker, since the Democratic Party picked up 40 House seats in the midterm elections.\n\nSome Trump allies believe that he will have an easier time negotiating a longer-term deal with her, offering to agree to some Democratic priorities in return for his wall. Other observers think that he has always preferred to attack Democrats over the lack of a wall than to actually build one, so that a Pelosi speakership will wind up being useful to him politically.\n\nAll those calculations changed Thursday morning, though, following a night and a morning of harsh criticism from Fox News hosts and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Trump announced that he would reject any short-term spending bill that did not offer more money for border security, although he did not specific an amount.\n\nBuilding a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trump\u2019s singular campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times between June 2015 and Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.\n\nThe \u201cforcing Mexico to pay\u201d part, though, was quietly dropped almost immediately upon his taking office. In a phone call with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mexico\u2019s president at the time, Trump said that he understood Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has been conflating the \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d made of reinforced concrete that he promised during his campaign with a \u201cbollard fence\u201d design of steel posts that was adopted and started during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nOf late, he has suggested describing his wall as \u201cartistically designed steel slats\u201d so Democrats won\u2019t object to it as vociferously.\n\nThe shutdown will have little effect through the weekend and even on Monday, Christmas Eve, and Tuesday, Christmas Day, which are both federal holidays. But non-essential employees at the affected departments will be furloughed starting Wednesday, while employees considered essential \u2015 including Trump\u2019s Secret Service detail and many tens of thousands of workers in the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard \u2015 will be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Jim Acosta: Trump 'Hates' Mattis Letter \u2014 And News Stories That He Needs Adult Supervision", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-acosta-jim-mattis-trump_us_5c1d8f94e4b0407e907b0db5", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta said Friday that a source has told him that President Donald Trump is furious about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019 resignation letter, tendered in the wake of the president\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.\n\nBut Trump is even more incensed about news coverage indicating he needs adult supervision, Acosta told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.\n\n\u201cHe hates that letter,\u201d Acosta said, citing a source close to the White House who \u201cadvises the president occasionally.\u201d But he added that Trump is even more upset by the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that Mattis and some others in his administration \u201cwere sort of the adults in the room ... to keep the president from going overboard, to be a check on his impulses.\u201d\n\nTrump is \u201cirritated by this notion here in Washington that he is sometimes in need of adult daycare,\u201d Acosta added.\n\nMattis\u2019 letter of resignation discusses his differences with Trump over several issues, one of them being the importance of strong international alliances, according to Mattis.\n\n\u201cWhile the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies,\u201d Mattis wrote.\n\nAcosta spoke as members of the Senate were scrambling to come to some sort of compromise on a spending bill that would satisfy the president\u2019s demand for funding for a border wall so the government wouldn\u2019t be shut down.

A 7-month-old baby reportedly choked on the beads of a wooden teething bracelet and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risks we\u2019ve observed with these products and want parents to be aware that teething jewelry puts children, including those with special needs, at risk of serious injury and death,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., said in a statement.\n\nThe beads of teething jewelry may be made of silicone, wood, or other materials, including amber. The manufacturers of amber teething necklaces claim that a baby\u2019s body temperature warms the amber, releasing a pain-relieving chemical that can be absorbed through their skin to relieve teething pain.\n\nAnd indeed, that chemical, called succinate or succinic acid, has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits. But the FDA has not tested the necklace manufacturers\u2019 claims for safety or effectiveness.\n\nPetardj via Getty Images Teething rings can pose a severe hazard, according to the FDA.\n\nDr. Jaime Friedman, a San Diego-based pediatrician, praised the FDA for issuing the warning. Friedman says that parents rarely ask for her advice on these teething necklaces before they buy one for their baby, but she frequently sees patients wearing them during appointments.\n\nFriedman makes it a point to counsel caregivers away from using them by bringing up choking and strangulation risks, as well as the unknown effects about the amber itself.\n\n\u201cI have not, as of yet, seen that there\u2019s any evidence of [succinic] acid in the bloodstream,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you do have this acid in the bloodstream, do we know what it\u2019s doing? No, I don\u2019t think we do.\u201d\n\nFriedman, who is an official spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics and affiliated with Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group, said that if parents insist on using the necklaces, she advises them to not let babies wear them unsupervised. That means no jewelry while they sleep, or while sitting in a car seat if an adult can\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s unsolicited advice, but hey, that\u2019s my job right? To protect kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has taken a strong stance against other at-home teething pain remedies, including numbing gels or creams for gums, as well as homeopathic teething tablets that were found to contain belladonna, a poisonous plant that can be dangerous to people.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caregivers give their babies a teething ring that has been chilled in the fridge to numb the pain. However, it warns against freezing teething rings, as frozen rings can damage gums. Another safe option for caregivers would be for them to use a clean finger to gently rub or massage their baby\u2019s gums."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric Hurts The Health Of Latino Families, Even Those Here Legally", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-immigration-health-latino-families_us_5c1938dee4b08db990586083", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "Facing critics who have decried these tactics as cruel and immoral, President Donald Trump continues to trumpet his administration\u2019s immigration policies and has doubled down on calls for a border wall with inflammatory rhetoric that stokes fear and distrust.\n\nThat kind of language, public health experts warn, can be damaging in its own right \u2014 especially among Latinos, regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\u201cWe know that deportations and family separations at the border are incredibly disruptive and traumatic to youth and their families. The detrimental impacts of family separations on child development and family systems are serious and long-lasting,\u201d said Dr. Laura Wray-Lake, a UCLA associate professor who has studied how Latinx teens react to immigration policies under Trump. \u201cWhat we\u2019re also coming to understand is that even for youth and families who are not directly threatened by these deportation or family separation policies, the policy climate is creating a more hostile and unsafe environment.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s enforcement tactics are fomenting fear \u2014 and that fear has consequences for health and well-being.\n\nThe ongoing threat of deportation is a form of psychological violence against the whole community.\n\nOne out of every four children in the U.S. is Latino, according to Dr. R. Gabriela Barajas-Gonzalez, an assistant professor in the department of population health at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine, and \u201cthe vast majority of these children are U.S.-born citizens.\u201d Yet even kids who are documented and legally protected from deportation can feel the emotional burden of an anti-immigrant climate.\n\n\u201cLatinx youth are following immigration politics and they can identify the injustices in what language is being used to describe immigrants and how policies are being applied to immigrants,\u201d said Wray-Lake.\n\n\u201cCurrent discourse about immigrants and immigration tends to be dehumanizing,\u201d said Barajas-Gonzalez. \u201cDehumanization is never healthy.\u201d\n\nCurrent discourse about immigrants and immigration tends to be dehumanizing. Dehumanization is never healthy. Dr. R. Gabriela Barajas-Gonzalez\n\nIn a comprehensive analysis of existing research, published in September, Barajas-Gonzalez and other researchers looked at how anti-immigrant rhetoric, dehumanizing language and aggressive immigration enforcement practices were harming Latino children. They found that those who belonged to mixed-status families, which have at least one citizen or legal immigrant child and at least one undocumented parent, dealt with persistent stress and emotional discomfort.\n\n\u201cMixed-status families may change their daily activities in attempts to protect themselves, consequently becoming more socially isolated,\u201d said Barajas-Gonzalez, who led the report. \u201cFor some children, the stigma associated with being from an immigrant family, experiences with discrimination and increased consciousness of legal status is marked by fear, hyperawareness and hypervigilance.\u201d\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images Sandra Chica holds the hands of her daughters during a rally and press conference in support of husband Pablo Villavicencio, who was detained in early June by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after making a catering delivery to Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn.\n\nChildren with these symptoms \u2015 which can also be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety \u2015 tend to be constantly on guard and tense, Barajas-Gonzalez added. \u201cThis state of arousal can be exhausting and impede children\u2019s ability to focus in school,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Kathleen Roche, an associate professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University, agrees. \u201cCitizen children of immigrant parents face risks to their mental health and school success when their parents suffer from elevated psychological distress,\u201d she added.\n\nFear is preventing Latino families from getting medical care.\n\nRoche was the lead author on a March report by GWU\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health that looked at how immigration news and changes in enforcement tactics impacted Latino parents and their teenage children in the U.S.\n\n\u201cFear and psychological harm triggered by recent immigration events appear to spill over into the lives of legally residing U.S. Latinos,\u201d she said. As a result, people weren\u2019t seeking help to take care of their own health, safety and well-being.\n\nResearchers surveyed 213 Latino \u2015 mostly Central American \u2015 parents of teens in a suburb of a large mid-Atlantic city (the location was not named to protect the identities of the study participants). While some of those parents were undocumented, more than two-thirds were living in the U.S. legally as citizens, permanent residents or under temporary protected status.\n\nSixty-six percent of participants reported being worried \u201cvery often or always\u201d about family members getting separated and nearly 40 percent said they \u201cfrequently avoided getting medical care, help from police, or support from social services.\u201d\n\nFear and psychological harm triggered by recent immigration events appear to spill over into the lives of legally residing U.S. Latinos. Dr. Kathleen Roche\n\nOf the parents surveyed, only those who were U.S. citizens seemed \u201cprotected from the harmful consequences of immigration policy changes,\u201d Roche said.\n\nA University of California survey of health care providers, published in July, supports these findings. In that report, 42 percent of providers said children in immigrant families were increasingly missing scheduled medical appointments and 38 percent said immigrant families were increasingly not scheduling routine prevention or primary care appointments for their kids.\n\nEven unborn babies are being affected.\n\nPolitical rhetoric and policies that target specific immigrant groups could also be contributing to an increase in preterm births (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) among Latinas, according to a study released by Harvard University\u2019s Chan School of Public Health in October.\n\nUsing population information from New York City, researchers found that preterm births among Latinas rose from 7.7 percent before Trump became a presidential nominee to 8.2 percent after his inauguration. Preterm births among Latinas born in Mexico and Central America rose even more during that same period, increasing from 7.3 percent to 8.4 percent.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is that this is affecting not only the mothers but the next generation, because when you\u2019re born premature, it increases the risk of infant death, it increases the risk of infant illness and it increases the risk of different kinds of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, when you get older,\u201d Dr. Nancy Krieger, a professor of social epidemiology and the lead author on the study, previously told HuffPost.\n\nAnother study, published in 2017, examined birth weights in Iowa before and after a 2008 immigration raid in Postville \u2015 one of the largest single-site federal immigration raids in U.S. history. Researchers found that after the raid, babies born to Latina mothers, regardless of immigration status, were at a higher risk of low birth weight compared to the same period a year earlier. Babies born to white mothers did not suffer the same effect.\n\nLanguage matters. Policy matters more.\n\nFear, force and toxic rhetoric are having measurable negative impacts on Latinos living in the U.S. \u2014 and anti-immigrant hostility doesn\u2019t seem likely to decrease any time soon."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Marvel Gives The OK For Iron Man To Be Put On Gravestone Of Young Fan, Parents Say", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marvel-iron-man-gravestone_us_5c1bd54de4b05c88b6f6210a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "Marvel fan Ollie Gardiner was diagnosed with brain and spine cancer just before his 11th birthday in May 2015.

It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Government Shuts Down as Talks Fail to Break Impasse", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-shutdown-border-wall.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-22 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "There had been a glimmer of progress late in the day when the Senate voted, 48 to 47, with Mr. Pence breaking a tie, to begin debating stopgap spending legislation passed Thursday night by the House that would keep the government running through Feb. 8 and provide $5.7 billion to begin construction of the wall on the southwestern border.\n\nBut the vote was more a repudiation of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal than an endorsement of it.

Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, perhaps the most vulnerable Republican senator up for re-election, suggested the president needed to recognize the damage he was inflicting with the suburban voters who are so pivotal to the party.\n\n\u201cI think conduct matters and I think message matters and we need to do a better job,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.\n\nLanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution fellow who advised Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012, said Mr. Trump was sorely testing the strength of his political support. Mr. Chen, who counsels a number of influential congressional Republicans, said Mr. Trump\u2019s drastic shift in the national security arena had the potential to be destabilizing on the right.\n\n\u201cThe change in policy in Syria really highlighted the tension that exists between mainstream conservatives and elements of the Trump coalition,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known these tensions were there, but now we\u2019re actually seeing it in a very visceral way.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Shutdown?

Disinclined to abandon his institutional prerogatives for even the most magnificent wall, Mr. McConnell immediately made clear this was not an option.\n\nAt an afternoon bill signing, the president continued trying to shift blame onto Democrats, calling the wall \u201can issue of crime\u201d and \u201csafety,\u201d claiming that it would \u201cpay for itself on a monthly basis\u201d and asserting that even President Ronald Reagan had failed in his quest for a border wall (which, in fact, Mr. Reagan never sought).\n\nSenators trickled back into town to vote on a procedural motion on whether to move forward with the House\u2019s latest proposal, which includes Mr. Trump\u2019s wall money. But Senate leaders made clear that nothing was likely to move until a new bipartisan compromise could be reached. Midafternoon, Ms. Sanders told Roll Call that there might be some lower level of wall funding that would satisfy the president. The talks to resolve the dispute collapsed Friday night. And the shutdown became a certainty.\n\nThis is what happens when the nation\u2019s chief executive holds a leadership philosophy akin to that of the Petyr Baelish character on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 namely, that \u201cchaos is a ladder.\u201d For most people, uncertainty and disorder are scary, unsettling forces to be avoided. But for Mr. Trump, they are cherished friends and strategic assets, in part specifically because other people are so anxious to avoid them. The president clearly believes that throwing everyone else off balance gives him an edge \u2014 that is, if he can make the turmoil fierce enough, those around him will give up and give in.\n\nBetter still, even when he doesn\u2019t get his way, piling on the pandemonium keeps people from focusing on any one piece of it. The normal human mind can cope with only so much drama before it gets overloaded.
