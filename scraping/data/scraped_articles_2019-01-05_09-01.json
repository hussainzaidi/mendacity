Kennedy International Airport, as many as 170 TSA employees have called out each day this week, Thomas tells CNN. Officers from a morning shift were required to work extra hours to cover the gaps.\n\nCall outs have increased by 200%-300% at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, where typically 25 to 30 TSA employees call out from an average shift according to a local TSA official familiar with the situation.\n\nUnion officials stress that the absences are not part of an organized action, but believe the number of people calling out will likely increase.\n\n\"This problem of call outs is really going to explode over the next week or two when employees miss their first paycheck,\" a union official at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport told CNN. \"TSA officers are telling the union they will find another way to make money. That means calling out to work other jobs.\"\n\nNorth Carolina airports, including Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, have experienced 10% higher TSA call outs, according to Mac Johnson, the local union president. \"That number will get worse as this drags on.\"\n\nThe call outs are \"creating a vulnerability\" and screeners are \"doing more with less,\" Johnson said.\n\nTwo of the sources, who are federal officials, described the sick outs as protests of the paycheck delay. One called it the \"blue flu,\" a reference to the blue shirts worn by transportation security officers who screen passengers and baggage at airport security checkpoints.\n\nA union official, however, said that while some employees are upset about the pay, officers have said they are calling in sick for more practical reasons. Single parents can no longer afford child care or they are finding cash-paying jobs outside of government work to pay their rent and other bills, for example.\n\nAbout a quarter of the government, including TSA and the Department of Homeland Security, have been without funding since December 22. Some 55,000 TSA employees who screen around 800 million passengers a year are considered essential and are among the 420,000 federal workers expected to continue working without pay.\n\n\"Call outs began over the Holiday period and have increased, but are causing minimal impact given there are 51,739 employees supporting the screening process,\" Bilello told CNN in a statement, adding that TSA had screened 2.2 million passengers Thursday and 99.8% waited less than 30 minutes. \"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change.\"\n\nHowever, \"Wait times may be affected depending on the number of call outs,\" Bilello said.\n\n\"TSA is grateful to the agents who show up to work, remain focused on the mission and respectful to the traveling public as they continue the important work necessary to secure the nation's transportation systems,\" he said.\n\nTSA previously has said officers will eventually be compensated.\n\n\"We've never had a situation where officers did not get paid,\" TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters while demonstrating security procedures at a Washington-area airport days before the shutdown began. He said recent shutdowns have been \"of a duration that it doesn't result in a delay in pay.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump and congressional leaders met Friday at the White House and are no closer to resolving the impasse. A shutdown could last months or even years, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nHow TSA may address the problem\n\nThe number of traveling passengers has grown by about 4% each of the last few years, Pekoske said in September. He said the growth \"without commensurate increases in the size of our Transportation Security Officer workforce ... has impacted both training and morale.\"\n\nAnd TSA is bracing for more call outs next week, according to veteran field officials. That means TSA officials at airports around the country -- cognizant that long security lines frustrate passengers -- could have tough decisions to make, including whether to let passengers board flights with less scrutiny.\n\nThe big question is \"How are they filling the void?\" said one of the veteran TSA officials, voicing concern about the impact on security. \"If you're not seeing long wait times at airports, there's something on the security side they're not doing.\"\n\nThose officials say the potential options airports may use include fewer random pat down security checks on passengers, or giving passengers who have not been vetted for the PreCheck program an expedited screening. Airports struggling to staff checkpoints may also start reducing the number of lanes open to passengers, which will likely mean longer lines and waiting times.\n\nAirports struggling with manpower issues could also opt to loosen standards for checked baggage based on a theory that people would not bring a bomb onto their own flights because the explosion would kill them, too. Known as positive passenger bag match, it presumes that if a passenger checks in and boards the flight, their checked luggage is safe, but some security experts are doubtful it is effective.\n\nThere are no indications that any of these measures have been necessary or implemented."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "See Trump's fiery response to impeachment remark", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/zZlKQyDBPxI/trump-responds-rashida-tlaib-impeachment-sot-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "President Trump responds to Rep.

And despite his rosier outlook, Trump conceded the impasse could reach an historic length, a timeline first relayed by the Senate's top Democrat.\n\nTrump \"said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time -- months or even years,\" according to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who spoke to reporters in the White House driveway.\n\n\"Absolutely I said that,\" Trump affirmed from the Rose Garden shortly afterward. \"I don't think it will, but I'm prepared.\"\n\nLater, two people familiar with the meeting said Trump even mentioned extending the standoff \"to the election\" and refused to back off his demand for $5.6 billion in funding for a border wall. He opened the talks by launching into a 15-minute salvo that also included griping at the House speaker for recent comments from Democratic lawmakers raising the specter of impeachment.\n\nDespite those disagreements, Trump announced that further discussions would occur over the weekend led by staff members. And he sought to highlight areas, like increasing port capacity, where he was in agreement with Democrats.\n\n\"We had a very, very productive meeting and I think we've come a long way,\" Trump said, adding later: \"We're all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open.\"\n\nTrump said he designated a group of aides, including Vice President Mike Pence, Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, to participate in the weekend discussions, which he described as meant to \"determine what we're going to do about the border.\"\n\nIt's that question which still divides the White House and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any attempts to secure new funding for a border wall. Both sides remained firm in their positions on Friday following the two-hour meeting in the White House Situation Room.\n\n\"We won't be opening until it's solved,\" Trump said of the debate over building the wall. \"It's a problem of national security. It's a problem of terrorists.\"\n\n\"We're not doing it in pieces,\" he went on. \"We won't be doing it in drips and drabs.\"\n\nDemocrats were equally dug in, saying the matter of a border barrier should only be brought up once the government has reopened.\n\n\"We cannot resolve this until we open up government, and we made that very clear to the President,\" Pelosi said after the White House meeting.\n\nShe described the session as \"a lengthy and sometimes contentious conversation\" but indicated there was some progress made.\n\n\"How do you define progress in a meeting?\" she asked. \"When you have a better understanding of each other's position? When you eliminate some possibilities? If that's the judgment, we made some progress.\"\n\nSenators are due back in the Capitol next week after the chamber adjourned Friday morning, meaning the shutdown will likely extend into a third week. Roughly 800,000 federal workers are going without pay and several federal systems are closed, including the Smithsonian museums and some national parks.\n\nTrump offered little solace to federal workers affected by the shutdown in his remarks on Friday, a group he's said little about since nine federal agencies saw their funding lapse last month. Some workers have said they are unsure of how they will pay for rent or living expenses without a regular paycheck.\n\n\"The safety net will be a strong border because we're going to be safe,\" Trump said when questioned about those federal workers' plight. \"I really believe that they agree with what we're doing.\"\n\nAsked if he thought landlords would be lenient on federal employees whose paychecks are affected by the shutdown, Trump said he did.\n\n\"I would encourage them to be nice and easy,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump on wall: I don't need Congress' approval Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on wall: I don't need Congress' approval 00:45\n\nThe midday meeting between Trump and congressional leaders in the White House Situation Room was a repeat affair after a similar session on Wednesday devolved into bickering and finger-pointing. On Friday, Trump found himself facing Pelosi a day after she was elevated to speaker, along Schumer, both of whom said they will not bend in opposing Trump's demand for border wall funding.\n\nEarlier in the day, the President sent a list of demands to Capitol Hill , releasing publicly a letter sent to members of Congress outlining the reasons he continues to seek a border wall. He said he was taking the step because Democratic lawmakers refused to listen the presentation during Wednesday's meeting at the White House.\n\n\"Absolutely critical to border security and national security is a wall or a physical barrier that prevents entry in the first place,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe letter was intended to perpetuate the White House's view of the border issue as a national security emergency -- one of the reasons that meetings with lawmakers this week were convened in the highly secure Situation Room, which has been used in the past to oversee classified raids or military campaigns.\n\nWhite House aides also hoped the classified setting -- where members of the media are not typically allowed -- would avoid an on-camera setting like Trump held with Pelosi and Schumer in early December, when the Democrats essentially goaded the President into saying he would own any government shutdown.\n\nTrump has largely abandoned that vow, blaming the state of affairs on a myriad of factors: Schumer, Pelosi's speakership prospects and the 2020 election.\n\nAsked Friday whether he was still proud to claim ownership of the shutdown, Trump offered an inexact response.\n\n\"I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing. I don't call it a shutdown. I call it doing what you have to do,\" he said.\n\nIn the Rose Garden, Trump was joined by GOP congressional leaders, his vice president, and the Homeland Security secretary, but not McConnell, who returned to Capitol Hill after the meeting.\n\nA McConnell aide later told CNN the Senate Majority Leader left the White House after the meeting unaware of the press availability that was to follow. Both he and the Senate's No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune, would have attended if asked, the aide said.\n\nTrump was asked directly in his news conference about McConnell's absence, and responded he wasn't in the Rose Garden \"because he's running the Senate.\"\n\nDemocrats believe they have effectively jammed McConnell with the plan the new Democratic House passed Thursday night -- a bill to reopen the government with no additional wall funding -- and that rank-and-file GOP senators will start to feel pressure and begin sending word that it's time to buck the President and put the Democratic proposals on the floor.\n\nRepublican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine -- both up for re-election in 2020 -- have indicated publicly the shutdown should end before a deal is reached on a wall, signs Democrats take as evidence their strategy is working.\n\nStill, senior Republican aides have noted the decision by Collins and Gardner is hardly reflective of where the broader conference stands. Most Republicans have backed the President's demands for at least $5 billion in funding for the border wall, which was his central campaign promise.\n\nAnd McConnell has insisted he will not bring for a vote any measure that Trump will not sign. The White House issued a veto threat late Thursday for the package of bills passed by the House.\n\n\"The package presented by the House's new Democrat leaders yesterday can only be seen as a time-wasting act of political posturing,\" McConnell said on Friday. \"It does not carry the support of the President. In fact, the administration explicitly indicated yesterday the President would actually veto it. And it cannot earn the support of 60 of my colleagues here in the Senate.\"\n\nMost of the President's allies have encouraged him to remain firm in his demands for border wall funding, even as the prospects of a bill emerging from Capitol Hill with the funds included grew slim with the swearing-in of a new Democratic House.\n\nEven inside the West Wing, the President's senior aides have not counseled him to accept Democratic proposals that would end the shutdown, believing that having the border security fight in the headlines is more preferable than the special counsel's Russia investigation or Michael Cohen's prison sentence.\n\nOn Fox News, the President's favorite cable channel, top host Sean Hannity offered a suggestion on Thursday of pairing border wall funding with protections for young undocumented immigrants brought to the US by their parents, recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA) program. It's the same plan Sen. Lindsey Graham floated to the President over lunch last weekend, though the President was noncommittal.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the topic arose in his meeting, but said he'd rather confront the issue separate from the border wall matter.\n\n\"We'll discuss it at another time. But there are a lot of great things that can happen with DACA if the Democrats wanted to do that,\" Trump said.\n\nRepublican and Democratic aides both said such a solution is not currently on the table in negotiations. Democrats have made clear they don't trust the White House or Trump to follow through in any broader deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Five teens die in Poland escape room blaze", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/sJKnN50qRh8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Five teenage girls celebrating their friend's birthday Friday afternoon at an escape room in Poland died in a fire, officials said.\n\nPolice and fire officials are still trying to figure out how the room caught fire, killing the 15-year-old girls and causing one other person to be hospitalized with severe burns, according to CNN Polish affiliate TVN24\n\n\"We join the families of the victims in their grief.

And he would tell us that when he was traveling he would go visit those people.\"\n\nYet the brother said he didn't know \"that Russia was specifically a place he'd like to go.\"\n\n\"He liked to travel wherever he could. He has been to India and Iceland, all over the place. He has friends in Russia, so that would be an extra draw, people he's met on social media, but I don't know that Russia was a particular place of return for him,\" David Whelan said.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to clarify that Whelan's lawyer is appealing his detention without bail, not his arrest.

Rubinow, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the School of Medicine at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nAnd this overflow is \"having a really destructive effect on health care delivery in general,\" he added. \"There are ERs now that are repeatedly on diversion -- which means they can't see any more patients -- because there are so many patients with mental illness or behavioral problems that are populating the ER.\"\n\nThis supports Rubinow's belief that ERs are a major provider of mental health care for a \"very, very sizable percentage of patients\" these days.\n\nDr. Catherine A. Marco, from her vantage point as an emergency physician professor at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, said, \"we commonly see depression, anxiety, substance-related conditions and suicidal behavior.\"\n\nFirsthand experience suggests to Dr. Mark Pearlmutter, an emergency physician in Boston, that the most common mental health problems in emergency rooms are dual diagnoses, such as \"substance abuse and depression, for example.\" He's also seen cases combining acute psychosis, bipolar disorder, suicidality, aggression and (mal) adjustment disorders.\n\n\"We're the safety net,\" he said.\n\nOn the opposite coast, Dr. Renee Y. Hsia, an attending physician at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, also finds that the most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses among adults in the ER are alcohol-related disorders, anxiety disorders and suicide or intentional self-harm. Based on her own research of \"avoidable\" ER visits, she found that two of the top three discharge diagnoses were alcohol abuse and depressive disorder.\n\n\"There are very real spillover effects from this phenomenon, which affects not only our ability to care for these patients with psychiatric needs but all patients seeking care in the ER,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to longer wait times for everyone, \"spillover effects\" include dissatisfied mental health patients and an assumption of potential violence in the ER, according to these doctors.\n\nHow one psychiatric patient sees the ER\n\nSharon Marshall, 43, says her multiple experiences in the ER as a psychiatric patient were \"very upsetting.\"\n\n\"They took your phone away, and you couldn't communicate with anybody else in the world,\" said Marshall, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Being held in the ER for \"hours and hours and hours,\" during which time \"you couldn't get your questions answered,\" means \"you have very little control over your circumstances\" and \"you're at their mercy,\" she said. \"Anybody would be upset.\"\n\nShe believes that her family should have requested outpatient services with her psychiatrist instead of authorizing an emergency psychiatric evaluation that was not voluntary on her part. It was not an arrest; it was a psychiatric hold, she explains.\n\n\"If you just play the game and you're quiet and don't pose any problems to them, they'll let you go,\" she said. \"If you questioned being held or resisted ... you'd likely go to a psychiatric facility. The process was so very arbitrary.\"\n\nLater, a car wreck gave Marshall greater perspective on her experiences as a mental health patient. Arriving in the ER with an arm injury \"was like a dream,\" said Marshall, who works as a certified peer specialist for the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network, a nonprofit advocacy and education organization. \"I was definitely taken seriously when I was in there for a car accident.\"\n\nDavid Morris, a psychologist at UT Southwestern's O'Donnell Brain Institute in Dallas, said, \"the ER is not a great place if you're a mental health patient; the cardiac patients get put in front of you, and you could end up being there for a really long time.\" Worse still, a mental health patient could be feeling extreme distress the whole time they wait.\n\n\"It's a real ineffective and inefficient place for them to get care,\" Morris said. \"People who need to be seen for other maladies that might be life-threatening, it slows them down as well.\"\n\nWhy is it happening?\n\nA psychiatric bed shortage is one cause of overcrowded ERs\n\nHsia points to \"a shortage of psychiatric inpatient beds\" as a \"key contributing factor\" to overcrowded ERs across the nation.\n\n\"Between 1970 and 2006, state and county psychiatric inpatient facilities in the country cut capacity from about 400,000 beds to fewer than 50,000,\" Hsia said.\n\nA 2012 Wake Forest University Health Sciences study also showed that psychiatric patients who are waiting in ERs remain there 3.2 times longer than nonpsychiatric patients. These longer stays mean that for every psychiatric patient idling in the ER, there are two other patients not being helped, according to the study authors. Patient \"boarding\" -- holding of a patient in an ER bed while waiting for an inpatient mental health bed -- occurs frequently, the study indicates.\n\n\"We've also seen shortages in outpatient mental health facilities and substance abuse treatment programs,\" Hsia said. Many psychiatric patients who would otherwise receive long-term care are going \"relatively untreated\" and so end up in ERs, she says. \"Patients may come to the emergency department when they cannot find help elsewhere.\"\n\nOne such patient is Karen Taylor, 46, diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Taylor, who has had suicidal thoughts, says she visited ERs in her home state of Georgia multiple times because she \"didn't want [the symptoms] to get so bad that I would actually go so far as to try to attempt suicide.\"\n\nShe was insured and routinely seeing a therapist, and Taylor's various trips to the ER were made out of necessity, she says, because her therapist does not offer after-hours services.\n\nDriven by thoughts of self-harm, she had originally taken herself to a psychiatric hospital, but it would not admit her without the ER referral, she explained in a pained voice.\n\nEmergency departments do not welcome patients like her, says Taylor, who described the ER as \"a bad place for a mental health patient.\"\n\n\"They strip away your dignity, your clothes, everything, and the doctor comes in and treats you like dirt because you're taking up a bed,\" Taylor said. \"I was told several times that I was just physically wasting space and I wasn't really sick like the medical patients were.\n\n\"They put me in a room where I stayed for hours on end. I've stayed in the ER for up to three days prior to going to a psychiatric hospital.\"\n\nMental disorder makes it difficult to access care\n\nUT Southwestern's Morris co-wrote a study that examined psychiatric readmissions at one of the largest public hospitals in the nation, Parkland Hospital in Dallas, with more than 1 million patient visits annually. Nearly three-quarters of mental health patients there were readmitted for the same problem, the study found.\n\n\"Most of the patients simply were not able to follow up with their care,\" said Morris, explaining that the reason for this might be patient confusion about how to access follow-up care or a problem with transportation.\n\n\"Organizing the community resources that are out there, they cannot do it themselves,\" Morris said. \"They need the help of a more structured environment. But the more structured environments that used to be available are no longer available.\"\n\nAsking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.\n\n\n\nThe International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nAs Morris sees it, if someone had diabetes and ended up in the ER, it would be clear that something's wrong with their ability to handle their condition and care. \"That's the issue,\" he said. \"Why are these folks having to do that? Do they need additional management and additional help to maintain the continuity of care?\"\n\nMarco, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, says psychiatrists, psychologists or other licensed therapists are often backlogged; this is why so many mental health patients show up in ERs.\n\nPearlmutter, the Boston emergency physician, agrees. The reason mental health patients end up in ERs, he says, is due to a lack of \"resources within the community and the closure many years ago (20, 30 years ago) of state facilities and, frankly, the fact that mental health is underfunded.\" Overcrowded outpatient facilities and services mean \"patients might call and not be able to be seen for two or three weeks,\" he added.\n\n\"And a lot of this transcends insurance,\" Pearlmutter said.\n\nIn certain regions, patients may call and ask to see a counselor, and the response is that they're not taking new patients, or they don't take insurance and only take cash. \"And if they do take insurance, the patient's got to wait,\" he said. \"If the patient's feeling like they're in a crisis, what options do they have? The only place to go is to the ER.\"\n\nThe ER may be the only place to go even for patients receiving routine care.\n\nAssumptions in the ER\n\nDan Stephens, whose diagnosis is major depressive disorder with psychotic features, sees a therapist once a week and a doctor every three months. Still, on two occasions, suicidal thoughts drove him to the ER.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I had zero wait time at the desk. They took me straight back to the mental health section\" of the ER, says Stephens, a 39-year-old warehouse worker. Delays occurred as he waited for an evaluation, he says. \"The first time, it took me four hours to speak to somebody, the second time about six or seven. They had given me something to calm down, so I had relaxed a little bit instead of being uptight and ready to do harm to myself.\"\n\nStephens believes that the ER was necessary given his condition. He accepts longer wait times because, as he understands it, multiple types of doctors are able to care for a patient with a broken bone, but only specialists can treat someone experiencing mental health problems.\n\nStill, one aspect of his two ER experiences was \"very humiliating,\" Stephens said: \"The worst part is being escorted to the back by a police officer.\"\n\nLeaving an ER can also be problematic for mental health patients, according to Stephens: \"Usually, you leave in a cop car in handcuffs.\" A 2016 national survey found that handcuffs were one of the \"available tools\" used by security personnel in 96% of the hospitals surveyed.\n\nThough he understands why security escorts and restraints might be necessary for some patients, he believes that these measures weren't needed in his case, and he resents their use.\n\n\"If I come in of my own volition and say 'Look, I need help,' they should just walk me back there without having to get a cop or security guard,\" says Stephens, who lives in a small town in Georgia. \"People look at you funny, that's what happens.\"\n\nWhen he was treated like a criminal, the whole process made him feel worse about himself, he says.\n\nPearlmutter suggests that doctors may automatically call in help to restrain a patient experiencing a mental health crisis. With overcrowding and more mental health patients, \"there's an increase in violence in the emergency department -- absolutely,\" he said.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nOne solution to ERs crowded with mental health patients is to do a better job at integrating mental health into medical practice, Pearlmutter says. It's helpful that family medicine and primary care physicians are increasingly providing mental health care, he says, but \"we still have a long way to go.\"\n\n\"Payors, by the way, play a role in this,\" Pearlmutter said. Health care is funded in a manner that promotes a \"siloing\" of mental health versus physical health. Insured patients, for example, have certain benefits provided for their physical health and separate benefits offered for mental health.\n\nMarco said, \"we need more resources, both inpatient and outpatient, for mental health and substance-related disorders. We should advocate for increased funding for treatment of these conditions.\"\n\nRubinow says he first wrote about ERs crowded with mental health patients years ago.\n\n\"At that time, it was a tsunami on the way,\" he said. \"That tsunami has hit.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says he could keep shutdown going for months or years", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/oCsR5dDP-fc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A meeting Friday between President Donald Trump and newly powerful Democrats ended in varied descriptions of what transpired, with Republicans expressing fresh optimism a deal could be struck and their political opponents offering drearier views of a compromise.\n\nNeither side emerged detailing an immediate breakthrough that could end the continued stalemate that has allowed a partial government shutdown to wear on for two weeks. And despite his rosier outlook, Trump conceded the impasse could reach an historic length, a timeline first relayed by the Senate's top Democrat.\n\nTrump \"said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time -- months or even years,\" according to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who spoke to reporters in the White House driveway.\n\n\"Absolutely I said that,\" Trump affirmed from the Rose Garden shortly afterward. \"I don't think it will, but I'm prepared.\"\n\nLater, two people familiar with the meeting said Trump even mentioned extending the standoff \"to the election\" and refused to back off his demand for $5.6 billion in funding for a border wall. He opened the talks by launching into a 15-minute salvo that also included griping at the House speaker for recent comments from Democratic lawmakers raising the specter of impeachment.\n\nDespite those disagreements, Trump announced that further discussions would occur over the weekend led by staff members. And he sought to highlight areas, like increasing port capacity, where he was in agreement with Democrats.\n\n\"We had a very, very productive meeting and I think we've come a long way,\" Trump said, adding later: \"We're all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open.\"\n\nTrump said he designated a group of aides, including Vice President Mike Pence, Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, to participate in the weekend discussions, which he described as meant to \"determine what we're going to do about the border.\"\n\nIt's that question which still divides the White House and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any attempts to secure new funding for a border wall. Both sides remained firm in their positions on Friday following the two-hour meeting in the White House Situation Room.\n\n\"We won't be opening until it's solved,\" Trump said of the debate over building the wall. \"It's a problem of national security. It's a problem of terrorists.\"\n\n\"We're not doing it in pieces,\" he went on. \"We won't be doing it in drips and drabs.\"\n\nDemocrats were equally dug in, saying the matter of a border barrier should only be brought up once the government has reopened.\n\n\"We cannot resolve this until we open up government, and we made that very clear to the President,\" Pelosi said after the White House meeting.\n\nShe described the session as \"a lengthy and sometimes contentious conversation\" but indicated there was some progress made.\n\n\"How do you define progress in a meeting?\" she asked. \"When you have a better understanding of each other's position? When you eliminate some possibilities? If that's the judgment, we made some progress.\"\n\nSenators are due back in the Capitol next week after the chamber adjourned Friday morning, meaning the shutdown will likely extend into a third week. Roughly 800,000 federal workers are going without pay and several federal systems are closed, including the Smithsonian museums and some national parks.\n\nTrump offered little solace to federal workers affected by the shutdown in his remarks on Friday, a group he's said little about since nine federal agencies saw their funding lapse last month. Some workers have said they are unsure of how they will pay for rent or living expenses without a regular paycheck.\n\n\"The safety net will be a strong border because we're going to be safe,\" Trump said when questioned about those federal workers' plight. \"I really believe that they agree with what we're doing.\"\n\nAsked if he thought landlords would be lenient on federal employees whose paychecks are affected by the shutdown, Trump said he did.\n\n\"I would encourage them to be nice and easy,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump on wall: I don't need Congress' approval Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on wall: I don't need Congress' approval 00:45\n\nThe midday meeting between Trump and congressional leaders in the White House Situation Room was a repeat affair after a similar session on Wednesday devolved into bickering and finger-pointing. On Friday, Trump found himself facing Pelosi a day after she was elevated to speaker, along Schumer, both of whom said they will not bend in opposing Trump's demand for border wall funding.\n\nEarlier in the day, the President sent a list of demands to Capitol Hill , releasing publicly a letter sent to members of Congress outlining the reasons he continues to seek a border wall. He said he was taking the step because Democratic lawmakers refused to listen the presentation during Wednesday's meeting at the White House.\n\n\"Absolutely critical to border security and national security is a wall or a physical barrier that prevents entry in the first place,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe letter was intended to perpetuate the White House's view of the border issue as a national security emergency -- one of the reasons that meetings with lawmakers this week were convened in the highly secure Situation Room, which has been used in the past to oversee classified raids or military campaigns.\n\nWhite House aides also hoped the classified setting -- where members of the media are not typically allowed -- would avoid an on-camera setting like Trump held with Pelosi and Schumer in early December, when the Democrats essentially goaded the President into saying he would own any government shutdown.\n\nTrump has largely abandoned that vow, blaming the state of affairs on a myriad of factors: Schumer, Pelosi's speakership prospects and the 2020 election.\n\nAsked Friday whether he was still proud to claim ownership of the shutdown, Trump offered an inexact response.\n\n\"I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing. I don't call it a shutdown. I call it doing what you have to do,\" he said.\n\nIn the Rose Garden, Trump was joined by GOP congressional leaders, his vice president, and the Homeland Security secretary, but not McConnell, who returned to Capitol Hill after the meeting.\n\nA McConnell aide later told CNN the Senate Majority Leader left the White House after the meeting unaware of the press availability that was to follow. Both he and the Senate's No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune, would have attended if asked, the aide said.\n\nTrump was asked directly in his news conference about McConnell's absence, and responded he wasn't in the Rose Garden \"because he's running the Senate.\"\n\nDemocrats believe they have effectively jammed McConnell with the plan the new Democratic House passed Thursday night -- a bill to reopen the government with no additional wall funding -- and that rank-and-file GOP senators will start to feel pressure and begin sending word that it's time to buck the President and put the Democratic proposals on the floor.\n\nRepublican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine -- both up for re-election in 2020 -- have indicated publicly the shutdown should end before a deal is reached on a wall, signs Democrats take as evidence their strategy is working.\n\nStill, senior Republican aides have noted the decision by Collins and Gardner is hardly reflective of where the broader conference stands. Most Republicans have backed the President's demands for at least $5 billion in funding for the border wall, which was his central campaign promise.\n\nAnd McConnell has insisted he will not bring for a vote any measure that Trump will not sign. The White House issued a veto threat late Thursday for the package of bills passed by the House.\n\n\"The package presented by the House's new Democrat leaders yesterday can only be seen as a time-wasting act of political posturing,\" McConnell said on Friday. \"It does not carry the support of the President. In fact, the administration explicitly indicated yesterday the President would actually veto it. And it cannot earn the support of 60 of my colleagues here in the Senate.\"\n\nMost of the President's allies have encouraged him to remain firm in his demands for border wall funding, even as the prospects of a bill emerging from Capitol Hill with the funds included grew slim with the swearing-in of a new Democratic House.\n\nEven inside the West Wing, the President's senior aides have not counseled him to accept Democratic proposals that would end the shutdown, believing that having the border security fight in the headlines is more preferable than the special counsel's Russia investigation or Michael Cohen's prison sentence.\n\nOn Fox News, the President's favorite cable channel, top host Sean Hannity offered a suggestion on Thursday of pairing border wall funding with protections for young undocumented immigrants brought to the US by their parents, recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA) program. It's the same plan Sen. Lindsey Graham floated to the President over lunch last weekend, though the President was noncommittal.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the topic arose in his meeting, but said he'd rather confront the issue separate from the border wall matter.\n\n\"We'll discuss it at another time. But there are a lot of great things that can happen with DACA if the Democrats wanted to do that,\" Trump said.\n\nRepublican and Democratic aides both said such a solution is not currently on the table in negotiations. Democrats have made clear they don't trust the White House or Trump to follow through in any broader deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says he is considering using emergency powers to build wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/LJ6VJnQ2rSQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering using emergency powers which would allow him to use military funding to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying \"I can do it if I want.\"\n\n\"We can call a national emergency because of the security ...

I may do it but we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly,\" he said during remarks in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nTrump has repeatedly talked about declaring a national emergency in recent months but hasn't followed through yet, allowing the government to shut down over funding the wall rather than declaring one.\n\nOn Friday, he seemed to indicate that he would prefer to secure the funding through Congress.\n\n\"If we can do it through the negotiating process, we're giving that a shot,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Trump also said he believes he doesn't need congressional approval to build the wall.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Trump replied. \"We can call a national emergency.

Most of those projects are intended to improve readiness which the Pentagon has repeatedly stressed is a major priority.\n\nAccording to this official, there are $13 billion in obligated funds from prior years that have not yet been spent and $10 billion in FY 19 funds already earmarked for various military projects, examples of which include building a fire station at Quantico, improvements at a Navy SEAL training facility and F-35 vertical landing pads in California.\n\nThe cancellation of any of those projects could upset Congressional members from those districts.\n\nTrump would also be forced to deal with project termination costs for unspent funds from previous years and lawmakers may resist giving the Pentagon that money again in the future, the source said.\n\n\"The idea that President Trump is considering declaring a phony national emergency as a pretext to take billions of dollars away from our troops and defense priorities in order to pay for his wall should alarm all Americans,\" Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a statement.\n\n\"Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong. And our troops and taxpayers should not bear the burden of a broken, preposterous campaign promise,\" he said.\n\nUsing this legal authority to construct border barriers was opposed by Democrats in the House and Senate in letters to then Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nThe officials said that while no formal direction or orders have been given to tap these funds, defense officials believe that the White House will move to direct the Pentagon to act should Congress prove unable to provide the necessary funding.\n\nIn December, several Democratic senators sent a letter to Mattis expressing opposition to the use of military funds for construction of a border barrier.\n\n\"We understand that the department is currently examining other authorities for this roughly $450 million project outside of the budget request process, specifically the potential use of 10 U.S.C. 2808 and 10 U.S.C 284,\" the letter said.\n\n\"As you know, outside of a few small locations requiring security measures for weapons of mass destruction shortly after 9/11, 10 U.S.C. 2808 has never been used inside the United States. We urge you in the strongest possible fashion to refrain from considering using this authority or 10 U.S.C. 284 for this potential $450 million border wall project,\" it added."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "McConnell notably absent as Trump talks shutdown fight after meeting with Hill leaders", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/1nNxJ0s8_Io/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who argued publicly this week that he has a limited role to play in resolving the standoff over government funding -- was notably absent from a news conference with President Donald Trump Friday that followed his high-stakes meeting with congressional leaders to discuss the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nWhile McConnell and Sen.

The findings cannot prove that frequent social media use caused depressive symptoms, or vice versa.\n\nThe study also described other factors, such as lack of sleep and cyberbullying, that could help explain this association.\n\nExplanations for the gender gap\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed data on 10,904 14-year-olds who were born between 2000 and 2002 in the United Kingdom. The data, which came from the UK Millennium Cohort Study , included information from questionnaires on the teens' depressive symptoms and social media use.\n\nDepressive symptoms were recorded as scores, and the researchers looked at which teens had high or low scores. They found that on average, girls had higher depressive symptom scores compared with boys.\n\nThe researchers also found that girls reported more social media use than boys; 43.1% of girls said they used social media for three or more hours per day, versus 21.9% of boys.\n\nWhen examining differences between girls and boys who spend the same amount of time on social media, the researchers found the stronger association between social media use and depressive symptoms for girls.\n\nThe data showed that for teens using social media for three to five hours, 26% of girls and 21% of boys had depressive symptom scores higher than those who used social media for only about one to three hours a day.\n\n\"For both girls and boys, the more social media they use, the more likely they are to have mental health problems, but not that many studies have been able to look for the explanations why,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"We looked at four potential explanations simultaneously, and this is the first paper to do that. We looked at sleeping habits; experiences online, so cyberbullying; how they thought about their bodies, or their body image, and whether they were happy with how they looked; and their self-esteem,\" she said. \"All of those four things -- the sleep, the cyberharassment, the body image or happiness with appearance, and the self-esteem -- they are all linked with the risk of having depression.\"\n\nIn other words, those experiences were tied to frequent social media use, which means they could play a role in the depressive symptoms. Among them, sleep and cyberbullying appeared to be the most important, Kelly said.\n\nAs for the big gender difference in the data, the study did not explore any explanations, but Kelly had some ideas.\n\n\"My best bet would be the types of things that girls and boys do online,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"In the UK, girls tend to more likely use things like Snapchat or Instagram, which is more based around physical appearance, taking photographs and commenting on those photographs,\" she said. \"I think it has to do with the nature of use.\"\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that the findings show only a correlation between depressive symptoms and social media use, not a causal relationship.\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether teens who have depressive symptoms are more likely to use social media, versus frequent social media use leading to depressive symptoms.\n\nAlso, the data in the study was self-reported from questionnaires, which runs the risk of a 14-year-old not accurately remembering or revealing the amount of time spent playing a game or watching a video on social media.\n\n'When it comes to depression, girls are more vulnerable'\n\nThe new study serves as \"a good addition to the literature on this important topic,\" said Dr. Anne Glowinski, professor of child psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis , who was not involved in the research.\n\n\"I would say that girls are, and have been for as long as measured, at a greater risk of depression than boys after puberty and that depression is a disorder which is caused by genetic and environmental, including social, determinants and their interaction,\" Glowinski said.\n\n\"If being online more is one of those social factors that makes the emergence of depression more likely -- as opposed to being online more representing already a symptom on the way to depression -- than it does not surprise me that there are gender differences and that girls are more vulnerable,\" she said. \"When it comes to depression, girls are more vulnerable.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Talking to teens about social media Replay More Videos ...

But now there is scientific evidence that respect can potentially save lives among the elderly and keep them both physically and mentally healthy.\n\nAn analysis by the global journalism network Orb Media found that countries with high levels of respect for the elderly recorded better health among older populations and lower poverty levels for over-60s.\n\nAs we enter a new phase of history -- with 2.1 billion people predicted to live beyond 60 by 2050 -- global attitudes toward older people have not kept up.\n\nIn a 2016 World Health Organization survey across 57 countries, 60% of respondents reported that older people are not respected.\n\nA more recent report by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK gauged the feelings of 2,000 British citizens and found some other bleak trends. Almost half -- 47% -- believed that people over 65 struggled to learn new skills. A quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds and 15% of the total respondents agreed that \"it is normal to be unhappy and depressed when you are old.\"\n\nBecca Levy, professor of public health and psychology at Yale School of Public Health, believes that negative attitudes are due to \"the growing medicalization of older adults\" and \"the growing anti-aging industry that promotes and actually profits from a fear of aging.\"\n\nBut in the UK alone, older people made net contributions to the economy of nearly 40 billion pounds (US $52.64 billion) during 2011, according to a 2011 analysis.\n\nThe dangers of stereotypes\n\nNegative stereotypes can be dangerous to older people in a number of ways, including shortening their lives.\n\nLevy analyzed interviews with 660 people from Oxford, Ohio, that were conducted over more than two decades and matched these with mortality information. Her team found that those with a positive attitude toward aging lived on average 7.5 years longer than those who viewed it as something bad.\n\n\"We were very surprised at this difference,\" said Levy, who believes that people with positive mindsets were able to live longer because positive attitudes can influence psychological, behavioral and physiological mechanisms in the body.\n\nPositive thinking can better behavior by leading people to engage in healthier lifestyles such as exercise. A person's positivity can also improve their psychology, making them better at coping with stress -- a contributor to memory loss and brain shrinkage\n\nAccording to one of Levy's studies , in Ireland over the span of 30 years, mental conditions such as depression and anxiety were more common among people with negative ideas about aging.\n\nDr. Luigi Ferrucci, geriatrician and director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging , was skeptical at first when the idea of a link between someone's health and their feelings about age was suggested.\n\nThe Baltimore team's study, which started in 1958, also asked participants about their thoughts on aging, and expecting to find no connection between the two. But they soon discovered that people with a positive attitude toward aging had less cardiovascular disease, they produced less cortisol -- a stress hormone -- over time, and autopsy findings showed less frequent dementia.\n\n\"Using very, very objective measures, we found that they were much better compared to those that had a negative attitude,\" Ferrucci said.\n\nBut he cautioned that, \"while the evidence is really strong, whether we can we generalize this [finding] to the general population is not completely understood.\"\n\nWhere are people most negative?\n\n\"High income countries are the highly industrialized countries and industrialization tends to devalue older people,\" explained Erdman Palmore, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, in an email, adding that traditional rural societies tend to have higher respect because older people can keep working longer and are more valuable to the economy.\n\nRetirement policies make older people seem less valuable to society and a country's economy, he said.\n\nJapan, South Korea and Argentina are the three lowest-ranking countries when it comes to respect for the elderly, according to World Values Survey carried out between 2010 and 2014, despite their large elderly populations. These respect estimates -- recorded in 2014 -- paint a changing picture of perceptions.\n\nIn Japan , for example, middle-age men, who were traditionally valued, are now seen as having lost their honor and value in society.\n\nThe UK report found that most beliefs around age are formed by the age of 6. \"Once prejudice has been learned it is often very hard to unlearn,\" the report's lead author, Toby Green, wrote in an email.\n\n\"For many people the stereotypes they absorb then persist into later life -- at which point they begin to apply them to themselves. This means that negative age stereotypes are embedded among groups of all ages,\" he said.\n\nElderly people walk in the street at Kouganji Temple in Tokyo.\n\nWhere did the stereotypes come from?\n\nRewinding the clock 200 years, researchers found a shift in attitudes toward the elderly in 1880.\n\nIn one study , they analyzed synonyms for the word 'elderly' in a database of 400 million words included in a range or print sources from the past two centuries and found that from 1810 to 1879, the concept of getting older was viewed positively in the United States.\n\nThen, from 1880 onward -- the midst of industrialization -- people started seeing aging as something bad. The researchers suggest the rising number of people over the age of 65 was associated with the increase in negative beliefs around age.\n\nStill, there remain many countries where the elderly are viewed as a valuable part of the population and deserving of respect.\n\nGeorgia, Uzbekistan and Qatar scored top places in the world value survey when asked about whether people aged over 70 are likely to be seen with respect.\n\nPositive mindsets about age have very real impacts on the elderly.\n\n2018 study found that the chances of dementia can be lowered by 49.8% if a positive outlook is maintained. Older people with happy thoughts have also been proven to recover faster from cardiovascular events, according to Levy's work.\n\nThe need for integration\n\nIn 2016, WHO acknowledged the need for ageism to be globally addressed and highlighted that ageism is most likely more widespread than sexism and racism.\n\nGreen believes that one of the solutions to reducing ageism is integrating generations.\n\nHis report for the Royal Society of Public health found that 64% of Brits didn't have a friend who is at least 30 years older than they are.\n\nIntegration is \"really important -- there's so much evidence on the health and wellbeing benefits of this,\" he said.\n\nStarting with young children and encouraging workplace diversity to tackle ageism are other strategies Green recommends. \"Making this progress in workplace settings would do a great deal of good for wider cultural change.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFerrucci believes that \"we need to see our life as a trajectory. Every single period is important.\"\n\nPeople should prepare for aging and make changes to their lives now to expand the years spent in good health, he said. Physical exercise and nutrition were the most important factors in longevity.\n\n\"Our aging population is the strongest, most important change that will occur in the world over the next 20 years,\" he added. \"When aging comes, it's not so bad if you have been planning for it.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Surrey train stabbing: Suspect arrested along with a woman", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-46768203", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Police and paramedics were called to Horsley station\n\nThe suspect being sought for the stabbing of a man on a train in Surrey has been arrested, British Transport Police say.\n\nA 51-year-old man died after suffering multiple knife wounds during a \"vicious fight\" on board a Guildford to London train on Friday afternoon.\n\nHe was killed in front of his 14-year-old son.\n\nThe victim and the attacker both got on the train at London Road station in Guildford at about 13:00 GMT.\n\nPolice believe the pair were not known to each other.\n\nThe suspect was detained at an address in the Farnham area at around 06:00 GMT on suspicion of murder.\n\nA 27-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan told BBC Breakfast: \"I can confirm this morning that we have arrested who we believe to be the suspect in relation to this violent offence and also another person involved as well.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said the altercation moved through two carriages\n\n\"Those arrests have taken place in an address in the Surrey area this morning.\"\n\nMr O'Callaghan described the sequence of events detectives know to have taken place on the train.\n\n'Unprovoked violent attack'\n\nHe said: \"We now know from enquiries we've been doing overnight and from witnesses that the two men were involved in a verbal discussion, that discussion lasted three to four minutes.\n\n\"It moved through one carriage from where they first boarded into another carriage, and that argument escalated to the unprovoked violent attack that sadly resulted in the death.\"\n\nMr O'Callaghan also said detectives are confident with the arrests they have made and no-one else was being sought in connection with the killing at this time.\n\nHe said: \"This is, as far as we can see at this moment in time, an incident that has occurred when two men have been talking to one another, opposed to a random attack on a train.\n\n\"Travelling on the train is still an extremely safe thing to do.

If I have to call a company, I'll always try to use web chat if it's available.\"\n\nA split was also found in the approach to area codes. In short: the younger people didn't feel strongly about them, and many didn't realise they had any geographical significance.\n\nThese codes originally corresponded to the first two letters of a place. Aberdeen, for example, was AB, which equates to 22 on the keypad. Today's code for Aberdeen is 01224.\n\nThe older people, on the other hand, found area codes helpful and reassuring when making and receiving calls. \"It's helpful to know where things are,\" said one 67-year-old from Wrexham.\n\nWhat does this say about the changing ways we communicate?\n\n\"We've seen a shift in people, away from thinking of communication as place-based, towards something more personal,\" Dr Bernie Hogan, from the Oxford Internet Institute, told the BBC.\n\nTime and place\n\nInstead of sharing phones in particular places, nailed to the wall or placed on a desk, we have got used to having our communication hub on our bodies, always at hand for messages, pictures and calls.\n\nDr Hogan said this does not necessarily mean the landline will disappear altogether. In fact, in an age of smartphones, it may find a renewed sense of purpose. \"The landline won't have a resurgence but what it represents might: being available at a certain place and time.\"\n\nAs anyone who has faced late-night work emails or calls will be able to tell you, the bounds around communication have loosened as we've moved away from distinct private and professional numbers.\n\nInstead of memorising different numbers for the office or for home, plenty of people now use the same phone for calls throughout the day. But how does this square with the various roles we inhabit from morning to midnight?\n\n\"A person is many people,\" said professor John Zimmerman, from Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. \"Dad, son, employee, member, etc. Often it is more important for our devices to know who we are in the moment when making a choice to allow, dismiss, or reroute a potential connection.\"\n\nUnhinged from clunky plastic handsets wired into specific rooms, what lines of communication should reach us when? Are we a manager in our child's bedroom, or a mother in a board meeting?\n\nFor many, these roles are increasingly managed by a platter of social media accounts, from your family WhatsApp group to your work LinkedIn account. Unlike an open public network such as a phone number system, however, these are privately owned; controlled by big technology companies.\n\n\"What we're seeing is a shift towards the corporatisation of our communication channels,\" warned Dr Hogan. \"It's a concern. There should be policy or legal means to allow for interoperable communication between corporate networks.\"\n\nDetached from names and private platforms, there's something simple about a series of numbers; a comprehensible digit-based address, pinpointing a line of communication. From webpage IP addresses to GPS coordinates, numbers seethe beneath the surface of our screens, but these are vast and complex, impossible to memorise or to feel a sense of ownership over.\n\nSo what will happen? A hipster return of landlines? A resurgence of area codes? Probably not, but as a generation grows up with smartphones in their pockets, new ways will need to capture what that 67-year-old from Wrexham told Ofcom:\n\n\"It's helpful to know where things are.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Hospital patients who smoke or drink to be helped to quit", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46762980", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:00:35", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nSmokers and problem drinkers who are admitted to hospital in England will be given help to quit or cut down, to reduce demands on the health service.\n\nThe measures are part of a long-term plan to be announced over the next few days by NHS England.\n\nIt said addiction to alcohol and tobacco were two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death.\n\nAnd the right support could save lives and help people stay fitter for longer.\n\nHealth charity Ash said it was delighted by the plans and Public Health England called the move \"smart\", saying it would save thousands of lives and help the NHS survive into the future.\n\nSupport schemes\n\nAlcohol-related harm costs the NHS in England around \u00a33.5bn each year -

with family.\n\nIt was informed by a review of evidence published at the same time in the BMJ Open medical journal, and follows a debate around whether youngsters should have time on devices

to health, as is sometimes claimed.\n\nThe review of evidence found associations between higher screen use and obesity and depression.\n\nBut the college looked at this and said it was not clear from the evidence if higher screen use was causing these problems or if people with these issues were more likely to spend more time on screens.\n\nThe review was carried out by experts at University College London, including RCPCH president Prof Russell Viner.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Parent and blogger Leyla Preston speaking on BBC Breakfast\n\nThe college said it was not setting time limits for children because there was not enough evidence that screen time was harmful to child health at any age.\n\nInstead, it has published a series of questions to help families make decisions about their screen time use:\n\nIs your family's screen time under control?\n\nDoes screen use interfere with what your family want to do?\n\nDoes screen use interfere with sleep?\n\nAre you able to control snacking during screen time?\n\nDr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the RCPCH, said phones, computers and tablets were a \"great way to explore the world\", but parents were often made to feel that there was something \"indefinably wrong\" about them.\n\nHe said: \"We want to cut through that and say 'actually if you're doing OK and you've answered these questions of yourselves and you're happy, get on and live your life and stop worrying'.\n\n\"But if there are problems and you're having difficulties, screen time can be a contributing factor.\"\n\nDr Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"screens are part of modern life\", adding: \"The genie is out of the bottle - we cannot put it

need to think about what's useful and helpful for their child.\"\n\nParents should consider their own use of screens, if screen time is controlled in their family, and if excessive use is affecting their child's development and everyday life, he added.\n\nWhat do parents say?\n\nA number of parents have been in touch with the BBC to say they disagree with the guidance and feel it does not go far

the brain, and the blue light produced by them can disrupt the body's secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin.\n\nWhile there are night modes on many phones, computers and tablets, there is no evidence these are effective, the college said.\n\nOverall, it found the effect of screen time on children's health was small when considered next to other factors like sleep, physical activity, eating, bullying and poverty.\n\nIt said there was a lack of evidence that screen time is beneficial for health or wellbeing.\n\nIts guidance recommends that families negotiate screen time limits with their children based on individual needs and how much it impacts on sleep, as well as physical and social activities.\n\nFor infants and younger children, this will involve parents deciding what content they watch and for how long they use the devices.\n\nAs children get older, there should be a move towards them having autonomy over screen use, but this should be gradual and under the guidance of an adult, the college said.\n\nDr Davie added: \"When it comes to screen time I think it is important to encourage parents to do what is right by their family.\n\n\"However, we know this is a grey area and parents want support, and that's why we have produced this guide.\n\n\"We suggest that age-appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child, that everyone in the family understands.\"\n\nThe college called for better quality research to understand more about how the content on devices, and the context in which they are used, affects health outcomes.\n\nTips for parents:\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mealtimes can be good for screen-free zones\n\nMealtimes can be good opportunities for screen-free zones\n\nIf children's

by experts at University College London and published in EClinicalMedicine.\n\nIt involved nearly 11,000 young people answering questionnaires on their social media use, online harassment, sleep patterns, self-esteem and body image.\n\nIt is separate to the RCPCH guidance on screen use and the review that informed it, neither of which looked at social media use.\n\nExperts not involved in the social media study said it added to existing evidence that heavy social media use may be harmful for mental health.\n\nBut they called for more research to better understand if it causes depression,

But it presents a communications challenge because there's no direct line of sight to Earth.\n\nImage copyright EPA/CNSA Image caption The far side is not visible from the Earth due to \"tidal locking\"\n\nThe Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December; it arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December.\n\nIt was then directed to lower itself toward the Moon, being careful to identify and avoid obstacles, Chinese state media say.\n\nThe Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history.\n\n\"This huge structure is over 2,500km (1,550 miles) in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,\" Andrew Coates, professor of physics at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey, told the BBC.\n\nThe event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle.

In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime. Scientists prefer to use far side to avoid confusion.\n\nBut because of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThe far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the \"maria\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nHow will scientists keep track of the rover?\n\nIn an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: \"The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications.

Scientists targeted a very flat area, but coming down on a sharp outcrop would have spelled instant failure for the mission.\n\nCaution by the Chinese authorities could have been behind the limited flow of news, which saw audiences searching for unofficial feeds of the launch on the social network Weibo due to the lack of coverage on state television.\n\nBut Ye Quanzhi said China had made efforts to be more open.\n\n\"They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3.

Increases in crop yields however are rising by less that 2% per annum, so there's likely to be a significant shortfall by 2050.\n\nWhile the use of fertilisers, pesticides and mechanisation have boosted yields over the past few decades, their potential for future growth is limited.\n\nInstead, scientists are increasingly looking to improving the process of photosynthesis as a way of increasing food productivity.\n\nImage copyright James Baltz/College of Agricultural Image caption Aerial view of the 2017 field trials. Researchers found that plants engineered with a synthetic shortcut are about 40% more productive.\n\nWhile plants use the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that fuel the plant's growth, the chemical steps involved produce some toxic compounds that actually limit the potential of the crop.\n\nThese toxins are then recycled by the plant in a process called photorespiration - but this costs the plant precious energy that could have been used to increase yield.\n\nIn this study, researchers set out to developed a way around the photosynthesis glitch.\n\n\"We've tried three different biochemical designs with the aim of shortcutting this very energy expensive process,\" said lead author Dr Paul South with the US Agricultural Research Service.\n\n\"It's been estimated that in plants like soybeans, rice and fruit and vegetables, it can be a significant drag on yield by as much as 36%. We've tried to engineer this shortcut to make them more energy efficient - and in field trials this translated into a 40% increase in plant biomass.\"\n\nOne important aspect of the problem is that it becomes more prevalent at higher temperatures and under drought conditions.\n\n\"Our goal is to build better plants that can take the heat today and in the future, to help equip farmers with the technology they need to feed the world,\" said co-author Amanda Cavanagh, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois.\n\nThe researchers chose tobacco plants because they are easy and quick to modify. They also form a fully closed canopy in the field similar to many food crops.\n\nThe team is now hoping to use these findings to boost the yields of soybean, rice, potato and tomato plants.\n\nImage copyright L.

I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country.\"\n\nThe US president reportedly said he preferred to call the action a \"strike\".\n\nTrump said he could declare a national emergency to build the wall without congressional approval, but would first try a \"negotiated process\". Trump previously described the situation at the border as a \"national emergency\" before he dispatched active-duty troops in what critics described as a pre-election stunt.\n\nTrump also said the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay would want him to \"keep going\" and fight for border security. Asked how people would manage without a financial safety net, he declared, \"The safety net is going to be having a strong border because we're going to be safe.\"\n\nSecurity officers at US airports have reportedly been calling in sick in droves since the shutdown began and their paycheques stopped rolling in.\n\nStrategies to end impasse\n\nLara Brown, a professor at George Washington University, told Al Jazeera the situation underscores the failure of Trump's campaign pledge to have Mexico pay for the border wall.\n\n\"Most Democrats are saying, 'Look we do have $1.3bn in border security funds in the package the House passed last night' ... and the president is still not accepting it,\" said Brown.\n\nDemocrats called on Trump to reopen the government while negotiations continue. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \"It's very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government.\"\n\nHouse Democrats muscled through legislation Thursday night to fund the government but not Trump's proposed wall. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said those measures are non-starters on his side of the Capitol without the president's support.\n\n181229064109297\n\nA variety of strategies are being floated inside and outside the White House, among them trading wall funding for a deal on immigrants brought to the country as young people and now here illegally, or using a national emergency declaration to build the wall.\n\nWhile Trump made clear during his press conference that talks on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme would have to wait and he was trying to negotiate with Congress on the wall, the conversations underscored rising Republican anxiety about just how to exit the impasse.\n\nBut with staff level talks, there is always an open question of whether Trump's aides are fully empowered to negotiate for the president. Earlier this week, he rejected his own administration's offer to accept $2.5bn for the wall. That proposal was made when Pence and other top officials met Schumer at the start of the shutdown.\n\nIntervention?\n\nTrump was joined by Pence in the Rose Garden, as well as House Republican leaders Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. McConnell, who went back to the Capitol unaware of the press conference, said it was encouraging that White House officials and the congressional contingent would meet over the weekend \"to see if they can reach an agreement and then punt it back to us for final sign off\".\n\nSchumer said if McConnell and Senate Republicans stay on the sidelines, \"Trump can keep the government shut down for a long time.\"\n\n\"The president needs an intervention,\" Schumer said. \"And Senate Republicans are just the right ones to intervene.\"\n\nAdding to national unease about the shutdown are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Radio La Colifata: Argentina's 'loony radio'", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2016/01/media-radio-la-colifata-argentina-loony-radio-160102073323596.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:14", "body_paragraphs": "La Colifata represents a broken space forgotten by others.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center,

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region.

He said the invasion targeted terrorists who were flowing into the Soviet Union.\n\nActually, the Soviets were trying to bolster communists in Afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the United States and the West.\n\nA look at some of the president\u2019s statements Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting:\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan\n\nTrump: \u201cThe reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there.\u201d\n\nThe facts: His assertion that the Soviets were experiencing a terrorist influx from Afghanistan is out of step with history.\n\nWhile Trump might personally agree with Russia\u2019s decision to invade Afghanistan in 1979, the United States at the time did not. The U.S. boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow in protest and the U.N. General Assembly voted 104-18 deploring the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.\n\nAt the time the U.S. supported the anti-communist rebels, known as mujahedeen, whom President Ronald Reagan called freedom fighters. The U.S. believed that the Soviet Union wanted to strengthen the communists but also that it wanted access to a warm water port through Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea.\n\nMaybe the \u201cterrorists\u201d Trump was talking about were the Afghan insurgents who were rebelling against a communist-led party that staged a coup inside Afghanistan in 1978. The Soviet Union was trying to bolster that party and subsequently sent in 100,000 troops to occupy the country and fight insurgents.\n\nThe United States actually took the side of Afghans fighting against Soviet forces, providing them with shoulder-fired rockets that allowed them to shoot down Soviet helicopters and planes. That further burdened the Soviets and increased their human and military losses. The Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989, the same year that the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.\n\n\u201cPraising Soviet invasion of #Afghanistan is an insult to the anti-communist struggle,\u201d tweeted Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.\n\nRevisionist Russia\n\nTrumps comments come as Russian lawmakers weigh historical revisionism on Afghanistan.\n\nBefore Feb. 15, the 30th anniversary of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia\u2019s legislature is to vote on a resolution stating that the invasion was conducted according to the \u201cnorms of international law.\u201d This would nullify a resolution passed in 1989 that condemned the invasion.\n\nTrump: \u201cRussia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is it was a tough fight. And literally, they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again, as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, a lot these places you\u2019re reading about now are no longer a part of Russia because of Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe facts: That\u2019s an oversimplification. It\u2019s true that the money the former Soviet Union spent on military and weapons in its competition with the West to wield influence around the world, including in Afghanistan, accelerated its demise. But Russia\u2019s intervention in Afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles, economic woes and a series of revolutions that led Soviet republics to seek their independence.\n\n\u200bIslamic State group in Afghanistan\n\nTrump: \u201cYou do have terrorists, mostly Taliban, but ISIS.

I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you let them fight?\u2019 Why are we getting in the middle of it? I said, \u2018Let them fight. They\u2019re both our enemies.

He said the invasion targeted terrorists who were flowing into the Soviet Union.\n\nActually, the Soviets were trying to bolster communists in Afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the United States and the West.\n\nA look at some of the president\u2019s statements Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting:\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan\n\nTrump: \u201cThe reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there.\u201d\n\nThe facts: His assertion that the Soviets were experiencing a terrorist influx from Afghanistan is out of step with history.\n\nWhile Trump might personally agree with Russia\u2019s decision to invade Afghanistan in 1979, the United States at the time did not. The U.S. boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow in protest and the U.N. General Assembly voted 104-18 deploring the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.\n\nAt the time the U.S. supported the anti-communist rebels, known as mujahedeen, whom President Ronald Reagan called freedom fighters. The U.S. believed that the Soviet Union wanted to strengthen the communists but also that it wanted access to a warm water port through Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea.\n\nMaybe the \u201cterrorists\u201d Trump was talking about were the Afghan insurgents who were rebelling against a communist-led party that staged a coup inside Afghanistan in 1978. The Soviet Union was trying to bolster that party and subsequently sent in 100,000 troops to occupy the country and fight insurgents.\n\nThe United States actually took the side of Afghans fighting against Soviet forces, providing them with shoulder-fired rockets that allowed them to shoot down Soviet helicopters and planes. That further burdened the Soviets and increased their human and military losses. The Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989, the same year that the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.\n\n\u201cPraising Soviet invasion of #Afghanistan is an insult to the anti-communist struggle,\u201d tweeted Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.\n\nRevisionist Russia\n\nTrumps comments come as Russian lawmakers weigh historical revisionism on Afghanistan.\n\nBefore Feb. 15, the 30th anniversary of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia\u2019s legislature is to vote on a resolution stating that the invasion was conducted according to the \u201cnorms of international law.\u201d This would nullify a resolution passed in 1989 that condemned the invasion.\n\nTrump: \u201cRussia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is it was a tough fight. And literally, they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again, as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, a lot these places you\u2019re reading about now are no longer a part of Russia because of Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe facts: That\u2019s an oversimplification. It\u2019s true that the money the former Soviet Union spent on military and weapons in its competition with the West to wield influence around the world, including in Afghanistan, accelerated its demise. But Russia\u2019s intervention in Afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles, economic woes and a series of revolutions that led Soviet republics to seek their independence.\n\n\u200bIslamic State group in Afghanistan\n\nTrump: \u201cYou do have terrorists, mostly Taliban, but ISIS. I mean, I\u2019ll give you an example. So, Taliban is our enemy. ISIS is our enemy. ... Taliban is here, ISIS is here, and they\u2019re fighting each other. I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you let them fight?\u2019 Why are we getting in the middle of it? I said, \u2018Let them fight. They\u2019re both our enemies. Let them fight.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I think I would\u2019ve been a good general, but who knows. But you know what? These are two enemies that are fighting against each other, and we end up going in and fighting. And what are we doing?\u201d\n\nThe facts: It\u2019s true that IS militants are fighting the Taliban for influence in some parts of Afghanistan, but keeping Afghanistan from becoming a safe place for extremists was the very reason the U.S. intervened in the country.\n\nThe U.S. intervention was a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The Afghan Taliban had given al-Qaida militants a place to train and embolden its forces to launch attacks on the United States and other targets.\n\nThe U.S. continues to keep 14,000 American servicemen and women in Afghanistan to execute counterterrorism missions against extremists to prevent a repeat of 9/11 and train and advise Afghan security forces, which are leading the fight against the Taliban."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump, Lawmakers Again Fail to End Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lawmakers-again-fail-to-end-shutdown/4729933.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "President Trump and congressional leaders failed again to reach a deal to end the partial government shutdown, with both sides signaling a deadlock over their positions on funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

He has since retired, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh has taken Kennedy's seat. He has no judicial record on the issue.\n\nThe court again has taken one case in which Democrats are accused of unfairly limiting Republicans' political power and one in which Republicans are the alleged culprits. The court also has the entire North Carolina congressional map before it, but only the one Maryland district.\n\nIn both cases, however, lower courts have found that the party in charge of redistricting \u2014 Republicans in North Carolina, Democrats in Maryland \u2014 egregiously violated the rights of voters in the other party.\n\nThe North Carolina map was redrawn in 2016 because federal courts determined two districts originally drawn in 2011 were illegal because of excessive racial bias.\n\nIn November, Republicans won at least nine of the 13 seats in North Carolina's congressional delegation and appeared to have won a 10th seat, in keeping with how many they held before the 2016 remapping. But state election officials have so far declined to certify the results in the 9th District in south-central North Carolina because of allegations of absentee ballot fraud.\n\nA key Republican in the North Carolina redistricting process, state Rep. David Lewis, has said that he drew 10 Republican districts because he did not \"believe it's possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\"\n\nThree-judge panel reviews decision\n\nIn January, a three-judge court found that the map violated the Constitution and ordered the state to come up with a new plan quickly, in time for the 2018 elections. But the Supreme Court delayed enforcement of the court order, mainly because the justices already were considering the partisan districting cases from Maryland and Wisconsin.\n\nWhen those cases did not settle the issue, the high court ordered the three judges to take a new look at their earlier decision. They reaffirmed the ruling in August, but also concluded there wasn't enough time to put new districts in place for 2018.\n\nCommon Cause, the watchdog group that supports limits on partisan line-drawing, is leading the challenge to the North Carolina districts. \"Whether it is Democrats or Republicans manipulating the election maps, gerrymanders cheat voters out of true representation,\" Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn said in a statement. \"The Supreme Court has the opportunity to set a clear standard that will restore a meaningful vote to millions of Americans disenfranchised by gerrymanders in Maryland, North Carolina and across the country.\"\n\nBill D'Elia, a spokesman for North Carolina Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger, said Friday that Democrats have been looking for much of this decade to find judges who will redraw maps that will boost their candidates. \"We hope the Supreme Court finally puts this nonsense to rest and that Democrats go back to the old-fashioned way of winning elections: convincing people to vote for them,\" D'Elia said in an email.\n\nIn Maryland, Democratic Rep. David Trone was sworn into office Thursday to represent a district that runs from the Washington suburbs to the rural northwest corner of the state. Democrats who controlled the redistricting process overhauled the district in 2011, turning what had been a reliably Republican stronghold into a Democratic district.\n\nRepublicans files suit\n\nSeveral Republican voters sued over the new district's boundaries, claiming it unfairly favored Democrats.\n\nA day after the November elections, a three-judge panel agreed with the Republicans who sued and ordered Maryland officials to draw a new congressional redistricting plan that isn't tainted by partisan gerrymandering.\n\nJudge Paul Niemeyer of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said in his opinion for the panel that the Maryland congressional map removed roughly 66,000 Republican voters from the district and added around 24,000 Democratic voters, \"bringing about the single greatest alteration of voter makeup in any district in the Nation following the 2010 census.\"\n\nTrone is not a party to the case, but he filed a legal brief in which he said he \"is no fan of partisan gerrymandering, but that does not mean it is a terminal disease, much less one that the judiciary can or should cure.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump, Lawmakers Fail to End Shutdown; Weekend Talks Planned", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lawmakers-fail-to-end-shutdown-weekend-talks-planned/4729593.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "A partial U.S. government shutdown showed no sign of ending soon Friday as White House and congressional aides prepared to work through the weekend to try to resolve a stalemate over funding for U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nTrump said he'd had a \"very productive\" meeting with congressional leaders to try to end the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreement over $5.6 billion in funding to build the wall.\n\nBut Democratic congressional leaders characterized the White House meeting differently.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who assumed leadership of the newly sworn in House Democratic majority Thursday, called the almost two-hour meeting \"contentious.\" She continued her oft-repeated assertion that agreement on the wall's funding \"cannot be resolved until we open up the government.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters the president threatened to keep the government closed for \"a very long period of time, months or even years.\"\n\nDespite comments from the Democratic lawmakers that little progress was made, Trump said that \"we're on the same path\" to reopen the government.

She suggested that the money could better be used for improving border security technology and hiring more border agents.\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the House plan to end the shutdown \"political theater.\"\n\nThe Senate passed an identical bill last month, while Republicans still controlled both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe legislation passed Thursday in the House called for the reopening of the federal government and the funding of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) until early February.\n\nWhile Trump himself has not used the word \"veto,\" other White House officials have. One official said the president told Democratic leaders he would \"look foolish\" if he ended the shutdown.\n\nTrump is blaming Democrats for the current situation after insisting on Dec. 11 he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government if his demand for wall funding was not met.\n\nOn Friday, in response to a reporter's question, Trump defended that comment. \"I'm very proud of what I'm doing,\" he said. \"I don't call it a shutdown.\"\n\nBut he confirmed that he'd told Democrats a shutdown could go on for months or a year or longer.\n\n\"I don't think it will, but I am prepared and I think I can speak for Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate. They feel very strongly about having a safe country, having a border that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nDHS seeks help\n\nAlso Friday, the Pentagon said it had received a request from DHS for additional help securing the U.S. southern border.\n\nA defense official told VOA that the Pentagon was reviewing the request for \"additional capabilities at the border.\" The official would not elaborate on what specific capabilities DHS requested.\n\nDHS is among the government agencies left unfunded because of the shutdown, but Congress has funded the Defense Department through Sept. 30, 2019.\n\nAbout 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay.

The company said demand for iPhones is waning and revenue for the last quarter of 2018 will fall well below projections, a decrease traced mainly to China.\n\nApple's shares dropped 10 percent Thursday on the news \u2014 its worst loss since 2013. The company shed $74.6 billion in market value, amid a broader sell-off among technology companies, which suffered their worst loss in seven years.\n\nApple's news is a \"wake-up call for the industry,\" said analyst Dan Ives of research firm Wedbush Securities.\n\nAnd it's not just Apple. Demand has been lackluster across the board, Ives said. Samsung, long the leading seller of smartphones, has been hit even harder, as its phone shipments dropped 8 percent during the 12 months ending in September.\n\n\"The smartphone industry is going through significant headwinds,\" Ives said. \"Smartphone makers used to be like teenagers, and the industry was on fire. Now it feels like they're more like senior citizens in terms of maturity.\"\n\nVictim of its own success\n\nTech innovations in phones grew in leaps and bounds earlier in the 2010s, with dramatic improvements in screen size, screen resolution, battery life, cameras and processor speed every year.\n\nBut the industry is a victim of its own success. Innovation began to slow down around 2014, once Apple boosted the screen size with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models. While phones kept improving, new features tended to be incremental, such as a new flash technique to already excellent phone cameras. It's the stuff consumers won't typically notice \u2014 or want to shell out for.\n\n\"Since the iPhone 6 you've seen it has been tough to innovate to continue to raise the bar,\" Ives said.\n\nApple customers now upgrade every 33 months on average, longer than the 24 or 25 months three years ago, he said.\n\nApple's diminished growth projections, fueled by plummeting sales in China, have reinforced fears the world's second-largest economy is losing steam. Its $1,000 iPhone is a tough sell to Chinese consumers unnerved by an economic slump and the trade war with the U.S. They also have a slew of cheaper smartphones from homegrown competitors such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo to choose from.\n\nThe fact that even Apple's iPhone juggernaut is suffering cements a larger trend for all major smartphone makers. After a steady rise for a decade, worldwide smartphone shipments fell 3 percent to 1.42 billion in 2018, the first annual drop, according to International Data Corp., which tracks such movements. IDC estimates that shipments will rebound 3 percent in 2019 to 1.46 billion, but that still falls short of 2017 levels.\n\nNo 'silver bullet'\n\nIt doesn't help that top phones come with four-digit price tags \u2014 $1,100 for the iPhone XS Max and $1,000 for Samsung's Galaxy Note 9. The top-end Max model sells for $1,450 in the U.S.\n\n\"They're getting more and more expensive while offering fewer and fewer new, innovative features that I'll actually use,\" said Zachary Pardes, a tech-savvy 31-year-old in Fairfield, Connecticut. \"I'll upgrade when the battery stops working. When I'm forced to buy a new phone, I'll buy a new phone.\"\n\nVivian Yang, a manager at a Beijing technology company, also balked at the price. \"Nobody needs such a phone,\" she said.\n\nIDC analyst Ramon Llamas said the cycle might bottom out and start growing again in 2021 or 2022, when people's current phones start reaching the end of their useful life. \"People will still replace their phones. It's going to happen eventually,\" he said.\n\nBut there's no \"silver bullet\" that will spur growth to levels seen in the past when the industry was less mature.\n\nFoldable smartphones, with screens that unfold like a wallet to increase display size, are one thing that could spur excitement, but they're expensive and not due out until at least the end of the year.\n\nAnother thing that might spur growth: 5G, the next-generation that telecom companies are currently in the process of building, expected to be faster and more reliable than the current 4G network. The first 5G compatible phones are due out this year.\n\n\"There's more pressure on 5G as the next-wave smartphone,\" since sales are so lackluster, said Ives. \"There will be a battle royale for 5G phones.\"\n\nBut 5G will take years for broad, nationwide deployment, so the new 5G smartphones coming out this year are not likely to make much of a splash immediately either.\n\nAnalysts say smartphone makers need to push into under-saturated areas like Africa and elsewhere, and also sell more services like cloud storage, streaming music and phone software. But the glory days of untrammeled growth appear to be over.\n\n\"It's going to be a slow slog,\" Llamas said. \"By no means is this the end of the smartphone market. But this is an indication that the smartphone market can be a victim of its own success.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Snacks on Wheels: PepsiCo Tests Self-driving Robot Delivery", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/snacks-on-wheels-pepsico-tests-self-driving-robot-delivery/4727515.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Forget vending machines, PepsiCo is testing a way to bring snacks directly to college students.\n\nThe chip and beverage maker says it will start making deliveries with self-driving robots on Thursday at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.

That is, until his community found out who he was.\n\nSome local residents, who asked that their names not be published for fear of retribution from McInnes, said they weren\u2019t aware of his status as leader of a neo-fascist organization until several Proud Boys made national headlines in October for attacking protesters in Manhattan. They were charged with assault and rioting, and McInnes\u2019 neighbors began to take notice, as The Daily Beast reported at the time.\n\nToday, there are signs dotting lawns in McInnes\u2019 neighborhood that read, \u201cHate Has No Home Here.\u201d They\u2019re passed out by local religious organizations and displayed proudly by locals.\n\n\u201cWe stand together as a community, and violence and hate are not tolerated here,\u201d one resident told HuffPost. \u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinions, but Gavin? What he\u2019s doing is a radical departure from discourse. He makes a conscious decision to incite violence and hate. We have our sign up because we want people to know this is a safe and friendly home.\u201d\n\nFor HuffPost McInnes seems to argue that displaying an anti-hate sign is an inherent attack on his family.\n\nNow McInnes\u2019 demons are catching up with him in his own community. On Friday, HuffPost obtained a letter penned by McInnes and dropped off at the homes of several residents who had the signs displayed on their properties. In a three-page, computer-typed screed dated Dec. 28, McInnes tells numerous and blatant lies about the Proud Boys, his status as their leader and his intolerant views.\n\nHuffPost is not publishing McInnes\u2019 letter, as it misrepresents his past actions, on which HuffPost has reported extensively.\n\nHe claims that his wife is a Democrat in an apparent attempt to level with his neighbors (public records show that she\u2019s a registered voter but not party-affiliated); that he is a \u201cbusinessman and humorist\u201d (he is indeed the co-founder of Vice Media and therefore a onetime businessman, but his incitement of violence and his public comments about rape, women and LGBTQ communities are anything but funny); and that the Proud Boys are merely a \u201cdrinking club I started several years ago as a joke\u201d (that\u2019s simply not true).\n\nOther media outlets and reporters, like ABC News\u2019 Paula Faris, have treated McInnes as a spectacle and \u201cprovocateur\u201d rather than an extremist gang leader, giving him room to deflect and deny things he\u2019s said and done. Faris\u2019 10-minute feature was particularly egregious in the eyes of some Westchester County residents. In her segment, she did not disclose that she lives in the same neighborhood as McInnes and that his children attend the same school as hers.\n\nAsked whether that social proximity should have been disclosed in the report, ABC News released a statement saying that Faris did her job in \u201cpressing McInnes on the group\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nMost of McInnes\u2019 letter is nothing new anyway; he has backpedaled on his past before \u2015 especially when he or his followers face consequences \u2015 by lying or arguing that the whole thing was a joke. Most recently, he released a video on YouTube saying that he \u201cquit\u201d the Proud Boys, but then admitted in the same breath that he only said so to somehow alleviate the sentences of Proud Boys members who were jailed on assault charges.\n\nWhat\u2019s telling about the letter is that McInnes seems to argue that displaying an anti-hate sign is an inherent attack on his family.\n\n\u201cIf you are liberal then you are, by definition, tolerant, and if you truly eschew hate, you know that loving your neighbor \u2015 your actual neighbor \u2015 is where tolerance begins,\u201d he writes. \u201cI am writing on behalf of my family to ask you to reconsider whether the message of your lawn sign moves our world and our village in the direction of love at all, or whether it sends a very different message instead.\u201d\n\nHuffPost spoke to several Larchmont residents who cited various reasons for displaying anti-hate signs in their neighborhood, not all of them having to do with McInnes. But they all agreed on one thing: McInnes is full of it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re so tolerant, then put up a fucking sign in your yard, too, and stop being so narcissistic as to think that this is all about you,\u201d said one resident.\n\nAnother said: \u201cHe thinks liberals are stupid and will buy into his B.S. \u2015 as a \u2018humorist,\u2019 he should understand that the joke is on him!\u201d\n\nThe letter, the neighbors said, isn\u2019t going to end their peaceful act of protest \u2015 at least until McInnes apologizes and provably ends his career as a gang leader."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Missouri Teen Left Blind After Mystery Illness Causes Her Eyes To Bleed", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-teen-blind-mystery-illness_us_5c2fc73be4b073352832bef1", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Courtesy Keith Walker Jordyn Walker is suffering from an unknown illness that robbed her of her eyesight.\n\nThis time last month, 15-year-old Jordyn Walker was editor and photographer of her high school newspaper, seasonal manager of the school\u2019s baseball team, and a competitive archer.

Over the years, she has seen a number of specialists, but the cause was never pinpointed. The symptoms, he said, would typically subside after a round of powerful antibiotics.\n\nThe first sign that something far more serious might be occurring with her was during a sea cruise the family took in July 2017. During the voyage, she became ill. Her teeth hurt, her stomach ached, and she had bloody stools. She lost her sense of taste and smell.\n\nWhen she was back on shore, doctors ran a number of tests and ended up treating her for a sinus infection. In Missouri a number of medical tests were conducted, but still no answers were found. She eventually regained her lost senses.\n\nJordyn Walker went back to enjoying life.

Janet Mills (D) signed Jan. 3 will make 70,000 more Maine residents eligible for Medicaid.\n\nOn her first full day in office, Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) took a promising and decisive step toward tackling the state\u2019s opioid crisis. In a reversal of the prior administration\u2019s recalcitrant stance, Mills signed an executive order to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which would extend health care coverage to tens of thousands more low-income residents, including those dealing with opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cA major part of the health care crisis is the opioid epidemic,\u201d Mills said during her inaugural address on Jan. 2. Drug overdoses killed a record 70,000 people in the U.S. in 2017, and Mills said her administration would create a director of opiate response to \u201cmarshal the collective power and resources of state government,\u201d in honor of the 418 Maine residents who died of drug overdoses that year. Maine is among the states that had the biggest increases in overdose deaths between 2017 and 2018.\n\nMills\u2019 inauguration has created a swell of hope among public health and addiction experts, who looked forward to the prospect of Medicaid expansion in Maine. They also welcome Mills\u2019 progressive attitude toward opioid addiction, which differs significantly from the views of her predecessor, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nLePage was known for being unsympathetic to the notion that opioid addiction is a medical problem. He framed the opioid crisis in divisive racial terms, as a \u201cwar\u201d against black and Hispanic drug dealers. Instead of treatment, he focused on law enforcement tactics.\n\nGust Stringos, medical director of Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan, Maine, characterized the former administration\u2019s approach as: \u201cWhy are we treating these people? They\u2019re just bad people anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttitudes like that spill over into stigmatization in the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMaine\u2019s 2017 overdose data show how failed these tactics have been,\u201d said Regina LaBelle, the former chief of staff at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Obama administration. \u201cMaine was the only state in New England that refused to embrace evidence practices that could have curbed the opioid epidemic.\u201d\n\nIn sad memory of the 418 Maine people who lost their lives to drug overdose in 2017, our Administration will create a Director of Opiate Response, a person who will marshal the collective power and resources of state government to stem the tide of this epidemic. #mepolitics \u2014 Janet Mills (@JanetMillsforME) January 3, 2019\n\nAndrew Coburn, a research professor emeritus at the University of Southern Maine\u2019s Muskie School of Public Service, was encouraged by the prospect of a drug czar to organize the state\u2019s response to the crisis, as well as Mills\u2019 previous efforts to expand access to naloxone, the overdose reversal antidote, in her previous role as Maine\u2019s attorney general.\n\n\u201cI believe the state\u2019s strategy will change dramatically,\u201d Coburn said.\n\nIn some ways, it already has. Although Maine voters passed Medicaid expansion in November 2017, LePage refused to implement the expansion during his time in office. Now, under Mills, health insurance coverage will reach an additional 70,000 low-income people. For those with opioid addiction, that new coverage could help them access and afford treatment, such as the addiction medication buprenorphine, which can cost more than $100 a month without insurance, said Leighton Ku, a professor at George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansions will also help the hospitals, clinics and doctors who provide care since it will mean they will get insurance payments, whereas they often get no payment now,\u201d Ku said.\n\nFor doctors who treat addiction on the ground in Maine, health care coverage under Medicaid can change the course of their patients\u2019 lives.\n\nStringos, a family practice physician in Skowhegan, which has a population of about 8,000 and is located in one of the poorest counties in Maine, said about half of his patients are being treated for opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cMany of them were on Medicaid and then lost it in the era of LePage,\u201d he said. Stringos recalled one patient who was doing well in addiction treatment until she turned 21 and lost her insurance coverage. It was a tumble after that. The patient dropped out of treatment for a year and became pregnant. Being pregnant qualified her for Medicaid again and she returned to treatment, but otherwise, health care \u2015 and treatment \u2015 would have been unavailable to her.\n\n\u201cIf she had been able to stay on Medicaid in the first place, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten pregnant and wouldn\u2019t have relapsed,\u201d Stringos said. \u201cThat\u2019s a typical story of people losing insurance and what happens.\u201d\n\nLabelle applauded Mills\u2019 swift action to prevent more stories like this one. \u201cTackling the opioid epidemic takes gubernatorial leadership,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Police Investigate After Woman In Vegetative State For Over A Decade Gives Birth", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-investigate-woman-vegetative-state-birth_us_5c2fae5fe4b073352832a6fb", "accessed_time": "2019-01-05 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "A woman who has been in a vegetative state for 14 years gave birth to a child last week while in the care of a facility called Hacienda HealthCare based in Phoenix.\n\nLocal news outlet KPHO-TV reports that the Phoenix Police Department began investigating the incident as a possible rape case after the woman gave birth on Dec. 29.

She was sausaging my body into an American flag T-shirt in the largest size they sold.\n\nShe was trying to help.\n\nIn the third grade, I\u2019d pore over their catalog for hours, longing not only for the bohemian-chic bandana halter tops but for the body that would allow me to wear them. The T-shirt was for a patriotic school event, red, white and blue temporarily replacing our khaki-based uniforms. I ended up wearing something else.\n\nAfter spending my entire childhood inside an obese body, I finally lost 80 pounds in my early 20s, having thought I\u2019d already tried everything. I\u2019d said as much to my boyfriend at the time, who would frequently remark on the attractiveness of other, thinner women. He assured me that it was all just thermodynamics, that I could lose the weight if I \u201creally wanted to.\u201d In a passive-aggressive quest to prove him wrong, I started starving myself outright. (Did I mention how healthy this relationship was?)\n\nAs the pounds came off, I had to admit he was right \u2015 but given my new body, I still won. Or at least, so I thought at the time.\n\nIn many ways, my weight loss changed my life for the better. My elevated blood pressure and resting heart rate dropped to normal, and later athletic, levels; I discovered passions for hiking steep trails and lifting heavy weights.\n\nAnd I definitely slammed into a solid slutty streak after I\u2019d shed the bulk of my excess body fat, intoxicated by a new ubiquity of male attention that I\u2019d hungered so long for. I tried out my new body with six partners in as many months, having only had two in the four years since I\u2019d lost my virginity.\n\nBut now that I\u2019ve had this \u201cnew\u201d body for half a decade, I have more insight into the not-so-intuitive \u2015 and not-so-nice \u2015 consequences of significant weight loss.\n\nWeight loss is difficult to do, but simple to conceive: consume less than you burn. On a living-life level, of course, the effort required is monumental, and it can have lasting effects on the psyche.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Jamie Cattanach Walking on the beach in Saint Augustine, Florida, in 2008 or 2009. One of the happiest days I can remember, 220-ish pounds notwithstanding.\n\nIn the Netflix Original \u201dTo the Bone,\u201d anorexia patient Lily Collins is accused of having \u201ccalorie Asperger\u2019s.\u201d Although I could never be mistaken for an anorexic, I can relate. Food doesn\u2019t look like food anymore so much as it does a sets of numbers: calories, grams of carbohydrate, minutes of cardio. I still track every single thing I eat, down to sticks of gum or sips of seltzer; I spend up to two hours in the gym on a nigh-daily basis. I follow strict and somewhat arbitrary food rules and indulge in massive, late-night binges. Although I only overeat foods in my \u201csafe\u201d categories, I might still consume 2,000 calories in a sitting, knocking back half a pound of almonds or a whole box of protein bars. Then I\u2019ll turn around the next morning and crank the elliptical as high as it goes, trying try to burn it right back off again.\n\nIf that sounds to you like an eating disorder ... yeah, probably. While I don\u2019t have an official diagnosis, I do have a go-to half-joke that on a scale from one to exercise bulimia, I\u2019m sitting at about a three. And what\u2019s worse, part of the reason I haven\u2019t been diagnosed is that the thought of seeking treatment is scarier than continuing to live like this. I like my disordered eating. I like the control I feel like it gives me, even though it\u2019s so obviously out of my control.\n\nThe problem is, it feels like power: the man who leans out of his truck window to say, Ma\u2019am, you\u2019re absolutely beautiful \u2015 just in case no one\u2019s told you today. The man who drops to his knees before me on the sidewalk, hands aloft as in prayer. The man who eyes my crossed legs in the coffee shop and asks if I\u2019m a dancer. And the tangible perks, too: the man who smiles shyly at me from behind glass, finding me a free ticket even though the show\u2019s sold out. All those speeding violations reduced to warnings.\n\nI\u2019d come to this after having been told, in no uncertain terms, I was repulsive. I was the kind of girl boys dared each other to kiss in high school because the concept was that hilarious. And when they did, my heart leapt, starved as it was for attention. To see life from the other side is dizzying, unthinkable. The whole world lays itself at the feet of beautiful women, I wrote in my journal, still not convinced I owned the adjective.\n\nThe problem is, you don\u2019t figure out until much too late why you so longed for that attention \u2015 the cultural reality that a woman\u2019s worth is tied largely to her physical appearance. And the problem is, in a culture that proves you\u2019re worth only the commodification of your body, you\u2019ll do absolutely anything to keep the validated version.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Jamie Cattanach Photo after hiking up Mount Wheeler, the tallest in the state of New Mexico, in the fall of 2018.\n\nThe fear of my apparent beauty \u2015 more accurately, the fear of losing it \u2015 holds me inside a cage, a calorie-counting, Stairmaster-stepping life that\u2019s nothing like what I\u2019d imagined. I remember watching the pretty, thin girls in high school, how they\u2019d miraculously eat lunches of pizza and French fries with no apparent consequences. Their lives, I thought, must be one long party: a stream of flirtations and consummations punctuated by guilt-free culinary indulgences.\n\nBut once my body approximated theirs, my enslavement to my newfound, ever-precarious thinness kept me from that seemingly-carefree lifestyle. Alcohol has too many calories; my insane morning gym sessions mean I\u2019m much too tired for nightlife \u2015 and besides, I\u2019m an introvert with an addictive personality. So I\u2019ll sit at home most evenings, reading a book or filling in crosswords, feeling my beauty like a dwindling resource, a lamp whose slowly-fading light I\u2019m wasting.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising part of significant weight loss: I\u2019ve done all the work, put in all the effort, and still, I struggle \u2015 I still, despite my efforts to the contrary, spend more time hating my body than loving it.\n\nI\u2019ll poke and prod my face in the mirror, pinching the flesh off my chin, checking to see if my beauty is still intact \u2015 if it ever was in the first place. I\u2019ve spent all of the past five years convinced and terrified that I\u2019m just on the cusp of regaining it all; I\u2019ll scroll through my backlog of anxious mirror selfies and see, no, I\u2019ve been pretty much the same size the whole time. I still think everyone thinks I\u2019m fat when they first meet me.\n\nA loss of 80 pounds means things aren\u2019t exactly where they\u2019re supposed be. Though I fit in a once-insane-sounding Size 4, I look nothing like the Victoria\u2019s Secret models whose photos I used to clip for \u201cthinspiration.\u201d The fat I have left pools in sags of excess skin: thighs that will rub no matter how many lunges I do, a swath of baggy belly.\n\nIn some ways, it\u2019s a simple case of moving goalposts. When I first lost the weight, carving a new self out of a much larger person, these imperfections were rendered inconsequential by comparison. Today, they\u2019re devastating, insurmountable \u2015 so much so that I may even hate my body more now than I did when I was obese. I\u2019m certainly more afraid of taking my clothes off. At least at 215, my suitors then knew what they were in for.\n\n(I know, too, that I\u2019m overthinking it, that I\u2019m more dysmorphic than deformed. What I really want: to see my body as something more than the externalization of my triumph or my failure.)\n\nWhen I was in college, I had a crush on a boy who didn\u2019t even know my name, despite the fact that we shared multiple classes. After the first 40 pounds came off, he was suddenly chasing me \u2015 and years later, he still sends me Christmas presents and flirtatious texts. One of these, sent after a visit in which I\u2019d rejected his physical advances, stuck with me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful and brilliant woman,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand I feel so grateful to be as close to you as I am.\u201d\n\nOK, I wanted to respond. But \u201cbrilliant\u201d didn\u2019t matter until the \u201cbeautiful\u201d part.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what no one says (but everyone knows) about weight loss: it does matter. It matters so much. That\u2019s why my mother struggled with me in that fitting room, trying to physically press me into something more suitable; why the boys who once ignored me now go out of their way to smile, to whistle, to tell me their names.\n\nAppearance does matter. To tell ourselves otherwise is a sham. The best we can do is to try to change it, to choose body positivity, to look in the mirror and actively decide to love ourselves \u2015 and others \u2015 exactly as we are.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you\u2019d like to see published on HuffPost?

Aside from being an occasional source of blood in the stool, diverticulosis usually does not cause symptoms.\n\nDiverticulitis \u2014 the suffix \u201citis\u201d indicates inflammation \u2014 typically occurs when a diverticulum becomes blocked by a piece of hard stool, called a fecalith.

At the most severe end of the spectrum, the abscess can rupture and stool may enter the abdominal cavity, which may result in sepsis, a dangerous blood infection.\n\nBut severe disease is not the norm.

It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}]
