His son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- the driving force behind the effort -- had invited the liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones and celebrity Kim Kardashian West to the White House for an impromptu meeting.\n\nBut first they had to deal with one problem that had been bothering the President for weeks: Willie Horton.\n\nHorton, a convicted murderer who raped a woman after he was granted a weekend furlough from prison in Massachusetts, was the subject of a withering 1988 presidential campaign ad attacking the Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor at the time. The ad, which exploited racist stereotypes, was devastating to Dukakis, and Trump was worried that he could suffer his own Willie Horton moment in 2020 if he backed the bill -- a fear stoked by Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chief congressional opponent of the effort.\n\n\"He was afraid,\" Jones said of the President. \"He was concerned someone would get out, hurt someone and that would be the end of his political career.\"\n\nJones, a CNN host and commentator, and Kardashian West sought to imprint the name of another convicted felon in Trump's mind: Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been serving a life sentence for money laundering and a nonviolent drug offense until Trump granted her clemency in June to broad acclaim. Every time Trump mentioned Horton, Jones and Kardashian West reminded him of Johnson.\n\nKim Kardshian West poses for a photo with President Trump in May 2018.\n\n\"We just kind of circled back, Van and I, in talking to the President to explain: But you have Alice now, and Alice is your legacy,\" Kardashian West, who had helped convince Trump last spring to commute Johnson's sentence, told CNN. \"She really opened up his heart and his eyes.\"\n\nThe half-hour meeting was just one of several pivotal moments that ultimately led Trump to endorse a groundbreaking prison and sentencing overhaul bill last month, ramping up pressure on a reluctant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who has doomed similar efforts in the past -- to bring it to the floor for a vote\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Senate passed the bill 87 to 12. Trump is expected to sign it this week before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort. The effort cements what is so far the biggest bipartisan victory of his presidency and turns the page on decades of policies that critics say were brutal, racist, ineffective and costly.\n\nThe timing is particularly noteworthy given that it comes as nearly every aspect of the President's political and business life is under investigation, and substantive congressional policy making has practically ground to a halt.\n\nThe bill's passage is also a win for Kushner, whom the bill's supporters credit with working behind the scenes to steer the legislation past significant opposition within the Trump administration and past shifting coalitions on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis story, based on interviews with more than a dozen administration officials, members of Congress, and advocates and opponents of the legislation, tracks the winding journey to push the bill, known as the First Step Act, through Congress to the desk of a President who campaigned on the promise of renewing tough-on-crime policies.\n\nAt times the bill seemed poised to fail. Yet at crucial moments a surprising political alliance emerged to keep it alive, one made up of social progressives, black Democrats, members of the religious right, fiscal conservatives and libertarians. The effort has proved so resilient this time around, opponents have dubbed the First Step Act the \"zombie bill\" for its refusal to die.\n\nUnder the legislation, thousands of federal inmates will be able to leave prison earlier than they otherwise would have. Many could secure an earlier release thanks to new credits awarded for good behavior or through participation in rehabilitation programs. The bill also eases some mandatory minimum sentences, gives judges more leeway to eschew certain sentencing guidelines and eliminates \"stacking\" provisions that leave offenders serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed with firearms.\n\n\"If this bill is the only step Congress takes, it will leave the important work of criminal justice reform substantially undone,\" said Ames C. Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. \"But as a real 'first step,' the bill both changes the conversation -- focusing on how we reduce federal prison sentences, not whether we do it at all -- and offers a real, immediate benefit for currently incarcerated people.\"\n\nA Democratic blockade\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries didn't want to be seen at the White House.\n\nThe New York Democrat represents parts of Brooklyn, one of the most anti-Trump districts in the country, and he was wary about the message his presence at the White House would send. So in the spring, when Kushner asked Jeffries to meet him at his office in the West Wing, he and Rep. Cedric Richmond, the Louisiana Democrat who's the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, refused. Instead, on March 22, Kushner came to them on Capitol Hill for breakfast. Jeffries, who had been working with Richmond on overhauling the criminal justice system for years, saw it as an early sign that Kushner was serious about the issue.\n\nStill, there was deep skepticism among Democrats. Many were averse to delivering Trump a win, and felt that simply being on the same side of an issue as the President was politically dangerous, particularly given his heated rhetoric over policing and inner city crime.\n\nIn 2016, Trump repeatedly spoke about bringing back controversial police practices, like stop and frisk, that disproportionately impact black and Latino men. When Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, said he would boycott Trump's inauguration in 2017, Trump tweeted in response that the civil rights icon \"should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.\"\n\nBut over months of meetings and calls with Kushner, Jeffries warmed to the idea that a criminal justice overhaul might be feasible under Trump. He found Kushner to be \"authentically committed\" and spent time talking with the President's son-in-law about the personal connection he had to the issue.\n\nKushner's father, Charles, served 14 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. Jeffries also found a willing cosponsor across the aisle in Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, a pastor who had seen his state's criminal justice overhaul efforts work to reduce recidivism rates.\n\nYet a difficult path lay ahead. First, Jeffries had to deal with critics in his own party.\n\nOn May 17, the Collins-Jeffries bill drew a fiery rebuke from some of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party, including Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The trio wrote a letter laying out the bill's faults as they saw them, including its lack of any sentencing revisions. The American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and other progressive groups opposed the bill.\n\nKushner offered to get involved but Jeffries insisted on handling it himself, according to Jones. In a day, Jeffries and his staffers wrote a point-by-point rebuttal to that letter while listening to the title tracks of one of the most famous rap battles, Jay-Z's \"Takeover\" and Nas' \"Ether.\" As they worked, Jeffries blasted the music on speakers in his office, according to an aide.\n\nThe next week, Jeffries stood up in a private House Democratic caucus meeting to defend his bill from the opposition of House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler of New York, former Attorney General Eric Holder and other powerful Democrats. \"What I recall is that Rep. Jeffries knew the bill in depth; answered questions fully; and removed the doubts of some completely,\" said Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California.\n\nA few days later, the bill passed the House with 360 votes, including nearly 70% of the House Democratic caucus and almost every Republican voting in favor of it.\n\n\"It's clear that some elements on the hard-left unleashed everything, including the kitchen sink, to try to stop the criminal justice reform effort in the House based on the worldview of all or nothing,\" Jeffries told CNN. \"In the House, we took the position that in order to break the back of the prison industrial complex we needed to begin with a significant, robust bipartisan effort around prison reform that could lay the foundation to get something done.\"\n\nAdministration opposition\n\nAs Jeffries was dealing with skeptical Democrats, Kushner was fighting with Republican opponents in the Trump administration, most notably then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nJared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, discusses US Mideast policy, prison reform, and what it's like working for President Donald Trump with CNN's Van Jones at the CITIZEN by CNN forum in New York.\n\nIn initial drafts, Sessions and his aides at the Justice Department worked to insert provisions that advocates of the bill considered \"poison pills,\" including introducing a new mandatory minimum sentence -- drawing uproar from Kushner's new Democratic partners, who questioned whether the political risk of associating with the White House would be worth it.\n\n\"Jared and others at the White House who were working on this went to bat for us,\" said Jessica Jackson Sloan, who along with Jones co-founded #Cut50, a group that advocates for reducing incarceration in the US. \"Jared said, 'I'm going to make sure this is right and I'm not going to let this crap happen again.' \"\n\n\"That was huge,\" Jones said.\n\nWithin weeks, Jones returned the favor by appearing alongside Kushner at a May 18 White House event focused on the prison legislation. Just walking into the Trump White House, Jones said, felt like \"political suicide.\" He and others who appeared onstage were assailed as \"Uncle Toms\" on social media.\n\n\"They didn't really understand why we were going,\" said Topeka Sam, a former felon who attended the White House event. \"The way we looked at it was, it's our house and despite who's in there, it's our country. And if we're looking to change what's happening to our people that are incarcerated, that we need to be at the table.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See Kanye and Trump's full White House meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See Kanye and Trump's full White House meeting 19:47\n\nBut the event offered proof of the bipartisan union that was coming together -- with left- and right-leaning advocates in attendance. It was also an indication that Trump was edging in favor of the bill.\n\nSeated in the front row of the gold-trimmed East Room, Mark Holden, senior vice president of Koch Industries, which has long advocated for criminal justice revisions, watched as Trump strayed from the teleprompter to make an off-script point about how a friend had hired some former prisoners who had turned out to be \"superstars.\" \"They would have never gotten the chance,\" said Trump.\n\nTo Holden and several administration officials, the riff was a sign that Trump wasn't just going through the motions. He was in. It was also a notable affront to Sessions, who was also seated in the front row.\n\nAround the time of the event, Sessions attended a meeting at the White House with Trump, Kushner and Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- another longtime advocate of criminal justice revisions. Sessions came armed with a memorandum laying out his arguments against the bill. But he didn't get far before Trump shut him down, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nIt didn't help that by then, Sessions had become a regular target of Trump's ire over his recusal from the Russia investigation. The mere fact that Sessions opposed the effort was almost enough to make the President support it.\n\n\"Trump liked the idea of overruling Sessions,\" said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter getting his hair cut at the Senate barbershop Tuesday, Sessions declined to talk to CNN about the First Step Act on the record.\n\nAugust setback\n\nBy August, momentum was building behind the bill.\n\nEarly that month, the President huddled at his Bedminster golf club with a group of Republican governors supportive of a criminal justice overhaul. There -- as he would in the Oval Office a month later -- Trump raised his concerns that he could face a Willie Horton moment of his own if he backed a bill that would grant early release to some convicted felons. The governors, a senior administration official said, helped assuage Trump's concern and pointed him to the benefit of sentencing overhauls in their states.\n\nBut then -- just as supporters of the bill expected a presidential endorsement was afoot -- Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, managed to get face time with Trump while he was at the White House, reviving the President's fears of Horton and reminding him of the political danger of endorsing the bill. That same day, McConnell told Trump the prison overhaul bill was too divisive among Republicans to bring to a vote before the midterm elections, multiple sources familiar with the call told CNN.\n\nUnder pressure, Trump agreed to table the issue until after the midterms.\n\nJUST WATCHED Jared Kushner full interview with Van Jones Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jared Kushner full interview with Van Jones 43:44\n\n\"At that point, we thought everything had died,\" said Jones.\n\nKushner extracted a promise from McConnell to bring the bill to a vote after the midterms if a whip count showed they had the votes. The delay gave supporters a chance to regroup and expand their coalition. Kushner began calling Sen. Mike Lee of Utah so frequently that when he interrupted Lee's family dinner during a vacation in Canada, they knew who it was. \"My family said, 'Oh it's Jared, isn't it?' \" Lee recalled.\n\nTo gain the backing of law enforcement groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police, and National District Attorneys Associations, supporters offered a few key concessions, including one that excludes people convicted of certain fentanyl-related offenses from being eligible for early release. That helped undercut the position of Cotton and other opponents, and positioned Kushner to present a strengthened bill to the President.\n\nMcConnell boxed in\n\nOn November 14, Trump delivered his endorsement in the White House Roosevelt Room, giving shout-outs to a number of Republican senators who wrote the revised bill -- Chuck Grassley , Lindsey Graham, Lee, Tim Scott, Rand Paul -- and Rep. Collins, an original co-author.\n\nBy then, most Senate Democrats had also jumped on board after some key sentencing provisions were added, including one that Senate Democratic Whip Durbin fought for in 2010 that reduced the disparity between sentences for powder vs. crack cocaine. The new legislation will apply that change retroactively to about 2,600 inmates who had been convicted under the previous statute.\n\nThere was still just one problem: McConnell was dragging his feet . The day after Trump gave his endorsement, the Senate majority leader told Trump in the Oval Office that he would not bring the measure up for a vote until next year, two administration officials said, pushing the careful compromise into the pit of divided government just as Democrats regain control of the House. Advocates were worried that decision could kill the bill, just as McConnell's reluctance to bring up a previous Senate bill sponsored by his whip, Sen. John Cornyn, and others stifled another effort at the end of the Obama administration.\n\nKushner and his allies began to ramp up pressure on McConnell. Conservatives flooded his office with calls, including thousands organized by the conservative grassroots group FreedomWorks, which also mounted a pressure campaign in Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn's home state of Texas.\n\nMcConnell needed to \"hear from everyone who matters to him and that the cost to him of not doing this was going to be greater\" than moving forward, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Trump put on the pressure, urging McConnell several times over the phone to bring the bill to the floor. And while some urged the President to attack McConnell on Twitter, Kushner convinced him to hold his fire, trusting McConnell would ultimately relent.\n\nLee unleashed\n\nBy the end of the month, Cornyn's office was telling the White House they didn't have the votes, claiming support for the bill was softer than it appeared, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nEven after Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House legislative affairs team did their own whip count and concluded they had over 60 votes, McConnell still wouldn't commit to bringing the bill to a vote before the end of the year. So Lee went into overdrive, lobbying his fellow senators day and night, by phone, by text, in person on the Senate floor, at lunch in the Senate cafeteria. \"I went nuts,\" Lee told CNN.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Lee's friend, the conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, signed on after they added certain provisions that would make it harder for some offenders to get an early release. Cruz was number \"29 or 30\" in Lee's mind -- more than enough to get the bill up for a vote and easily pass the Senate.\n\nOn December 10, Darrell Scott, a black pastor and early Trump supporter, warned McConnell's legal counsel that he would send hundreds of black pastors and activists -- in his words, \"500 angry black people\" -- to the Senate majority leader's office if he didn't take action.\n\nThat evening, Kushner made his most public push yet, appearing on Trump's favorite show -- \"Hannity\" on Fox News -- to plug the bill.\n\nThe next day, McConnell announced he would put the bill on the floor at the request of the President. Scott called McConnell to shower him with praise.\n\n\"I told him, 'We're going to build statues of you in the hood,' \" Scott recalled.\n\nA week later, on the day the bill passed the Senate, Jones and Kushner had an early-morning phone call to coordinate their efforts.\n\n\"The next 48 hours are critical,\" Jones jokingly told Kushner, echoing a phrase he had heard from Kushner at the end of nearly every one of their calls.\n\nBut the goal line was actually much closer, Kushner replied. \"I actually think it's only the next 12,\" he said.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Freedomworks is no longer associated with the Koch family."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Van Jones praises Trump: This is history", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/52_qpzQ9x-o/van-jones-praises-trump-criminal-justice-reform-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

A vote on Pittsburgh's proposed measures is not expected until early next year.\n\nErika Strassburger, city council member for the Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the synagogue shooting took place, said Monday that the effort shouldn't be seen solely as a reaction to the deaths at Tree of Life.\n\n\"Although that provided the momentum, this shouldn't be seen as a response to that event,\" she said.\n\nStrassburger said the proposed laws were a response to \"decades and decades of gun violence\" in Pittsburgh and an \"epidemic of suicide\" nationwide.\n\n\"We acknowledge that there have been efforts at the federal level and by state lawmakers to amend our firearms laws,\" she said. \"In light of those efforts going nowhere, we felt the need to take action on the local level.\"\n\nAmong the weapons that would be banned are any rifles with a pistol grip, folding stock and detachable magazine. The legislation specifically bans several AR-15 style weapons by name.

I want my witnesses to have a chance to tell what they saw,\" she said in a letter to her attorney.\n\nLawyers who handle sexual misconduct allegations said plea deals are common in such cases, and cautioned against rushing to judgment without knowing the context for the outcome.\n\nBut because the case never went to trial, the public may never fully understand the state of evidence that led to the outcome -- and that's more concerning to some lawyers than the actual plea bargain that spared the former fraternity president jail time or sex offender registration.\n\nJacob Walter Anderson was indicted on four counts of sexual assault in 2016 based on allegations that he drugged and raped a 19-year-old sophomore at a fraternity party. In her victim impact statement, the woman accused Anderson of forcing himself on her repeatedly as she blacked out and then leaving her unconscious \"face down in the dirt.\"\n\nAnderson's lawyers released a statement on Friday saying they had never seen a case with so many misrepresentations of what occurred. They said the encounter was consensual and called the victim's claims that he choked her and left her for dead \"fabrications\" that she only reported two years after the incident. Her lawyer did not return a request for a response to the defense statement.\n\nAnderson was expelled from Baylor after a campus Title IX investigation, a university spokeswoman said. While a student at the University of Texas at Dallas , he pleaded no contest in October to a lesser charge of unlawful restraint in an agreement with the McLennan County District Attorney's office.\n\nIn exchange for his plea, Anderson was offered deferred adjudication probation -- meaning he won't spend a day in jail, and his record will be expunged in three years if he pays a $400 fine and submits to psychological, alcohol and drug treatment. Judge Ralph Strother approved the plea last week in state court in Waco, sparking criticism that the outcome was too lenient given the allegations.\n\nThe news prompted an online petition calling on UTD to remove him from campus, followed by the school's announcement that it was banning an unnamed student fitting his profile from commencement activities.\n\nOutgoing District Attorney Abelino \"Abel\" Reyna stood by the outcome, saying the plea \"achieved the best result possible with the evidence at hand.\" His office declined to comment for this story.\n\nMcLennan County district attorney Abel Reyna retires at the end of the year.\n\nWithout a trial to lay out all the evidence for a jury to scrutinize, the public is wont to jump to conclusions -- especially in a case with such a wide disparity between the alleged conduct and the severity of the punishment, said defense attorney Gloria Allred. She is not affiliated with the case, but she has represented sexual assault accusers in high-profile cases, including Bill Cosby's accusers.\n\nMore troubling, Allred and other lawyers said, is the victim's claim that the district attorney's office never consulted her regarding the plea, and why the prosecutor told her she offered the plea.\n\nAllred worries that the outcome will deter crime victims from coming forward when victim cooperation is critical to successful prosecutions.\n\n\"Nobody can require a prosecutor to take a case to trial. Nor can they prevent (a prosecutor) from taking a case to trial,\" she said. \"But there seems to be such a disconnect between what the victim said happened and the sentence that naturally the public is going to have a lot of questions, and it's not helpful when we don't know the evidence.\"\n\nHere's what lawyers who spoke to CNN urged the public to keep in mind when evaluating plea bargains in sexual assault cases.\n\nWhy a case might end in a plea to lesser charges\n\nPlea bargains for reduced sentences are common in sexual assault cases, said the president of the national Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, and five defense lawyers who spoke with CNN.\n\nSuch cases can be tough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, they said -- especially when they lack witnesses or corroborating evidence, or if they hinge on consent.\n\nCleveland-based lawyers Susan Stone and Kristina Supler specialize in student disciplinary matters and Title IX investigations. They represent students and professors accused of misconduct as partners and co-chairs of Kohrman Jackson & Krantz Education Law and Student Defense Practice Group.\n\nStone called Anderson's case a \"thoroughly typical\" example of how criminal cases proceed through the system.\n\n\"The reality is, on a regular basis, cases are charged with various offenses, felonies and misdemeanors, and through the process in the legal system, charges are amended and the parties agree to a plea,\" she said. \"What I can tell you is, rarely a case ends the way it is charged.\"\n\nThe nature of sexual assault allegations tends to elicit an emotional response from the public that's hard to set aside, Supler said. But when a prosecutor offers a plea deal or declines to press charges, it's usually because they don't believe they have sufficient evidence to convince a jury of a defendant's guilt -- and the public is not privy to everything the prosecutor knows.\n\n\"What a lot of people who are not lawyers may have a hard time understanding is that, when there is a plea, it's because there are problems with the evidence and the prosecutors can't prosecute their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nProsecutors in the Baylor case indicated there were possible evidence problems. Assistant District Attorney Hilary LaBorde wrote in a letter to the victim and her parents that \"conflicting evidence and statements\" in Anderson's case made \"the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\"Any lawyer can issue a statement, but taking a statement and proving the truth of its contents beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, when a complaining witness is subject to cross examination, is a different task entirely,\" she said in a separate statement after the plea was accepted.\n\n\"Given the claims made publicly, I understand why people are upset. However, all of the facts must be considered and there are many facts that the public does not have. In approving this agreement, Judge Strother had access to all the statements that have ever been made by all people involved and agreed that the plea agreement offered was appropriate in this case.\"\n\nCNN legal analyst Mark Geragos said it's hard for him to believe that a prosecutor would \"give away\" a viable case in the era of #MeToo, when sexual misconduct allegations are being taken more seriously than in previous years. He urged those who are critical of the judge to consider that the district attorney's office made the offer in the first place.\n\n\"If a prosecutor made the offer, either she's completely out of touch or she realized there are problems with the proof in their case,\" he said.\n\nLittle to no jail time is common for first-time offenders\n\nThe victim in the case decried the plea for shielding Anderson from time in custody, alleging that he may continue to prey on women.\n\n\"Jacob Anderson will most likely rape again. He is now free to roam society, stalk women and no one will know he is a sex offender. Jacob Anderson and all rapists who get away with their crimes will never be cured, never change. If anything they will be emboldened by their power over women and their ability to escape justice and punishment,\" she said in her victim impact statement.\n\nBut little to no jail time is common for first-time offenders who have had no prior contact with the criminal justice system, said the lawyers who spoke with CNN.\n\nWhen prosecutors consider charges, they look at the evidence and whether they can prove the allegations, said David LaBahn, president and CEO of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Then, prosecutors look at the offender to determine the outcome that will balance justice for victims with long-term goals such as public safety and reducing the likelihood of reoffending, he said.\n\nState District Court Judge Ralph Strother accepted a plea agreement by former Baylor University fraternity president Jacob Anderson.\n\nFor first-time offenders who are not considered imminent threats to the public, prosecutors and judges are encouraged to consider alternatives to incarceration, such as treatment or diversionary programs, in the hopes that their first offense will be their last, LaBahn said.\n\nWith detention centers overcrowded, he said, imprisonment should be reserved for society's most dangerous offenders and the focus should be on rehabilitating offenders to end the cycle of violence.\n\n\"You cannot arrest, prosecute and jail yourself out of criminal justice problems ... you need to address the cause,\" he said. \"If you can address the cause, you reduce the criminality, but until you address the cause, the criminality is going to continue.\"\n\nWhat about the victim's rights?\n\nMore concerning than the plea itself, LaBahn said, is the victim's claim that the district attorney's office did not consult her before offering it to Anderson. Most states, including Texas , have a victims' bill of rights enshrined in state law, which affords them the opportunity to be notified about decisions regarding an offender.\n\n\"It's hard to know whether a result is proper or not without knowing the specific context,\" he said.\n\n\"But the treatment of the victim, that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe victim and her family learned about the plea deal in the media, a fact the prosecutor in the case later apologized for in a letter to them. But the victim was unassuaged.\n\n\"I have been waiting two and a half years for this trial. I have been through hell and back and my life has been forever turned upside down. I feel like I should have the right to the trial for the four counts of sexual assault the grand jury indicted him on,\" she wrote her lawyer.\n\n\"She (the prosecutor) has not kept me informed and has not discussed the plea with me at any time, other than to say she would not offer him one. I was furious and devastated when I read the newspaper article that she was basically dropping the sexual assault charges. And then in utter shock when her reason was because she lost a completely different case so she didn't trust a jury to do the right thing.\"\n\nIn her letter, prosecutor LaBorde said that a jury's verdict of not guilty in another rape case influenced her decision. She said the jury in the previous trial \"engaged in a lot of victim blaming,\" treatment that she thought the victim in Anderson's case would also experience because the behavior of the two victims was similar.\n\n\"It's my opinion that our jurors aren't ready to blame rapists and not victims when there isn't concrete proof of more than one victim. I have had success in trying college aged defendants yes, but in retrospect, ONLY when they have multiple victims,\" she wrote. \"Multiple victims put the focus properly on the criminal's conduct. That didn't happen when there was only one victim and one event to talk about.\"\n\nThough it's not clear exactly which similarities she was referring to, in the previous case against a defendant named Hunter Morgan, the victim had the defendant's DNA in her underwear and injuries to her genitals, LaBorde wrote. In Anderson's case, his lawyers said no DNA evidence links him to the incident.\n\nIn her letter, LaBorde also referred to the strength of the medical evidence regarding the injuries the victim experienced as a virgin, saying her injuries were more likely to be explained away because such injuries are common when someone has her first sexual encounter.\n\n\"The research suggests that victims with no sexual experience are more likely to be injured because a sexual encounter is their first,\" LaBorde wrote. \"So medically speaking, (this victim's) innocence and lack of experience makes the medical evidence less helpful.\"\n\nLaBorde also raised differences between the defendants that she thought might make a jury more sympathetic to Anderson.\n\n\"I actually thought the Hunter Morgan case was stronger than Jacob Anderson's because Morgan admitted the victim was intoxicated, too intoxicated to consent, and he admitted he wasn't intoxicated at all,\" she wrote. \"One weakness I've always identified with Anderson is that he was drinking also -- and although I think he's exaggerating -- he acts as though he was extremely intoxicated at the time he was at the frat party.\"\n\nThe decision to not go to trial\n\nAllred said the leniency Anderson experienced was \"more of the same\" in a criminal justice system that gives defendants in sexual assault cases the benefit of the doubt over the accuser.\n\nThe prosecutor's statements about why she chose not to go to trial show how the system has failed to keep up with the cultural reckoning prompted by #MeToo, Allred said.\n\nAllred acknowledged that proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt is an uphill battle. But she questioned the prosecutor making her decision to not try the case based on past outcomes, she said, because each case is different.\n\nAnd if past jurors have shown a tendency to blame victims, she said, it's a prosecutor's job to call witnesses and present evidence to dispel myths about how victims behave after experiencing a traumatic event.\n\n\"There's only one way we're going be able to move forward, and that's if juries are educated on what to expect from a victim,\" she said. \"That's a better alternative than saying, 'We can't go to trial because they may blame her or shame her.'\"\n\nThe victim shared similar concerns in her letter to her lawyer.\n\n\"This is the reason rape victims hesitate to report the crime. I had the courage to report the crime, go through an investigation, wait all these years to testify I have had to courage to keep on living so that I can testify.\"\n\nAnderson's case drew comparisons to the trial of former Stanford University athlete Brock Turner, who spent three months behind bars after a judge went against a prosecutor's recommendation for a harsher sentence. In Turner's case, it was clear that the sentence was \"awful but lawful,\" LaBahn said, because evidence and witness testimony was presented in open court. But in Anderson's case, the truth is less clear, he said.\n\nEven when the evidence isn't so clear cut, LaBahn said there's merit to bringing a case to a grand jury or to trial if it's what the victim wants: It allows them to have their day in court.\n\n\"I would like this not to become a situation where others don't report based on the outcome of this case,\" he said. \"Each case is different, and we really do need the victim's involvement.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Judge sentences poacher to year in jail -- and makes him watch Bambi monthly", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/tpsYVugYcy0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Missouri judge is turning to Walt Disney to make sure David Berry Jr. never illegally hunts again.\n\nBerry's sentencing is the latest event in one of the state's largest poaching cases.\n\nLawrence County Judge Robert George sentenced Berry to a year in jail for illegally killing deer, taking only their heads and antlers and leaving the rest of their bodies to rot.

But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nChristina Zayas was paid to post about Juul on her Instagram. The post has now been deleted.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "McConnell introduces short-term spending bill to avert government shutdown", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/vbQQZEIz1s8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday introduced a short-term spending bill to fund the government through February 8, 2019 in an effort to avert a partial government shutdown this week.\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell said that the measure, known as a continuing resolution, would \"ensure continuous funding for the federal government,\" and would \"provide the resources necessary to continue normal operations through February the 8th.\"\n\nIf the short-term measure is approved by both chambers of Congress, it would head to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature and prevent a partial government shutdown.\n\nCongress is currently in a race against the clock to prevent a partial shutdown when funding expires for several key government agencies at midnight on Friday.\n\nMcConnell's plan appeared to have the backing of at least one high-profile Democrat: Nancy Pelosi.

So, I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it down for border security.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nOn Wednesday morning, White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway sounded a very different note, suggesting that if Congress passed a short-term resolution to keep the government open then Trump would \"take a look at that certainly.\" Added Conway: \"A short term [continuing resolution] -- or a CR that goes through February 8 keeps the government up and running but that doesn't mean the President is backing down from an essential promise, not a campaign promise, a promise as President of the United States and our commander in chief to keep us safe.\"\n\nUh.......\n\nTrump himself sounded a similarly defensive -- and nonsensical -- note in a tweet on Wednesday. \"Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA!\" tweeted the President . \"Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!\"\n\nThis is a classic case of overcompensation.\n\nIn order to convince you -- and themselves -- that Trump's willingness to sign a short-term continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown isn't a capitulation of his former tough talk about doing whatever it takes to get funding for the border wall, both the President and Conway are suggesting that who you see and what you hear isn't actually true.\n\nTrump is going to get the wall money! And no matter what, Mexico is going to pay for it! Somehow!\n\nAt the moment, neither of those things are true. The truth? Trump made a promise -- and kept reiterating a promise -- he is now going back on.\n\nAnd his backing down this time has real consequences. Remember that Democrats take control of the House come January. Which means that the next time we have a government funding fight like this, it will be with divided government. And it's VERY hard to see how Trump will get the $5 billion+ he wants for a border wall with Democrats in charge in the House. Heck, he hasn't been able to get the money he wanted for the wall over the last two years, with Republicans in charge of everything!\n\nGo back to the spring. Congress was, yet again, bumping up against a hard deadline to either fund the government or have it shut down. Trump had pledged to sign no new omnibus spending bill that didn't include substantial funding for his border wall. Even after the legislation had been largely agreed to by Congress -- without the expenditure Trump wanted for the wall -- he threatened to veto it via tweet\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" he wrote\n\nThat turned out to be an empty threat -- as Trump eventually signed the omnibus bill. But when he did so, he issued another threat for the next shutdown showdown to come in the fall.\n\n\"I say to Congress: I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump said at the time . \"Nobody read it. It's only hours old. ... (It's) the second-largest ever. President Obama signed one that was actually larger, which I'm sure he wasn't too happy with either.\"\n\nIn the run-up to this latest deadline, which was initially December 7 before Congress -- wait for it -- passed a two-week extension, Trump and Republican congressional leaders were resolute that either Trump got the money he wanted for the wall or the government shut down.\n\n\"I don't do anything ... just for political gain. But I will tell you, politically speaking, that issue is a total winner. People look at the border, they look at the rush to the police, they look at the rock throwers and really hurting three people, three very brave Border Patrol folks \u2014 I think that it's a tremendous issue, but much more importantly, is really needed. So we have to have border security.\"\n\nAnd yet, as the deadline -- midnight Friday -- approaches, Trump appears to be ready to blink. Again.\n\nWhich is fascinating given not just his rhetoric over the last few months on the necessity of the wall but how central the construction of the wall was to his victory in the Republican presidential primary process in 2016.\n\nWithout his promise to build a wall along the country's southern border -- and make Mexico pay for it -- there likely would never have been a \"President Donald Trump.\" The wall became a stand-in for everything Trump supporters loved about him: A willingness to talk tough, to buck political correctness and to stand up for Americans. Aside from the \"lock her up\" chants directed at Hillary Clinton, the \"build that wall\" cheer was the largest and loudest rallying cry at nearly every Trump campaign rally in 2016.\n\nAnd now, almost certainly, Trump will, again, go back on that pledge. Despite insisting that after the last time he went back on the pledge he would never do it again.\n\nWhoops!\n\nDoes Trump's likely (re)capitulation on wall funding have any measurable political impact among his political base? The easy answer is \"no\" -- because, as the last two years have shown, almost nothing has any measurable political impact on Trump's base. They appear to be with him no matter what, entirely unaffected by outside events.\n\nIf -- and this is a big and shaky \"if\" -- there ever was an issue that made Trump's base (or a part of it) rethink its support for him, the inability of the President to wring the money needed for the wall out of Congress might be it. It is a foundational principle of Trumpism that Trump just keeps doing very un-Trump things about: Like giving in. Again. And this time with the real possibility that there will never be as good a chance to get even close to the amount of money out of Congress that Trump insists is necessary to build the wall."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "US preparing for 'full' and 'rapid' withdrawal from Syria", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/tiHhtZb2MiI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Planning is underway for a \"full\" and \"rapid\" withdrawal of US troops from Syria, a US defense official told CNN Wednesday.\n\nThe decision, which would be a reversal from previously stated US policy, was made by President Donald Trump, who has long signaled his desire to get out of Syria, the official added.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the President tweeted, \"we have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\"\n\nEven though the US will continue to maintain troops in Iraq with the capability of launching strikes into Syria, a US withdrawal of ground forces would fulfill a major goal of Syria, Iran and Russia and risks diminishing US influence in the region.\n\nThe US has about 2,000 troops on the ground in the country, where they are primarily training local forces to combat ISIS.

His son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- the driving force behind the effort -- had invited the liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones and celebrity Kim Kardashian West to the White House for an impromptu meeting.\n\nBut first they had to deal with one problem that had been bothering the President for weeks: Willie Horton.\n\nHorton, a convicted murderer who raped a woman after he was granted a weekend furlough from prison in Massachusetts, was the subject of a withering 1988 presidential campaign ad attacking the Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor at the time. The ad, which exploited racist stereotypes, was devastating to Dukakis, and Trump was worried that he could suffer his own Willie Horton moment in 2020 if he backed the bill -- a fear stoked by Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chief congressional opponent of the effort.\n\n\"He was afraid,\" Jones said of the President. \"He was concerned someone would get out, hurt someone and that would be the end of his political career.\"\n\nJones, a CNN host and commentator, and Kardashian West sought to imprint the name of another convicted felon in Trump's mind: Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been serving a life sentence for money laundering and a nonviolent drug offense until Trump granted her clemency in June to broad acclaim. Every time Trump mentioned Horton, Jones and Kardashian West reminded him of Johnson.\n\nKim Kardshian West poses for a photo with President Trump in May 2018.\n\n\"We just kind of circled back, Van and I, in talking to the President to explain: But you have Alice now, and Alice is your legacy,\" Kardashian West, who had helped convince Trump last spring to commute Johnson's sentence, told CNN. \"She really opened up his heart and his eyes.\"\n\nThe half-hour meeting was just one of several pivotal moments that ultimately led Trump to endorse a groundbreaking prison and sentencing overhaul bill last month, ramping up pressure on a reluctant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who has doomed similar efforts in the past -- to bring it to the floor for a vote\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Senate passed the bill 87 to 12. Trump is expected to sign it this week before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort. The effort cements what is so far the biggest bipartisan victory of his presidency and turns the page on decades of policies that critics say were brutal, racist, ineffective and costly.\n\nThe timing is particularly noteworthy given that it comes as nearly every aspect of the President's political and business life is under investigation, and substantive congressional policy making has practically ground to a halt.\n\nThe bill's passage is also a win for Kushner, whom the bill's supporters credit with working behind the scenes to steer the legislation past significant opposition within the Trump administration and past shifting coalitions on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis story, based on interviews with more than a dozen administration officials, members of Congress, and advocates and opponents of the legislation, tracks the winding journey to push the bill, known as the First Step Act, through Congress to the desk of a President who campaigned on the promise of renewing tough-on-crime policies.\n\nAt times the bill seemed poised to fail. Yet at crucial moments a surprising political alliance emerged to keep it alive, one made up of social progressives, black Democrats, members of the religious right, fiscal conservatives and libertarians. The effort has proved so resilient this time around, opponents have dubbed the First Step Act the \"zombie bill\" for its refusal to die.\n\nUnder the legislation, thousands of federal inmates will be able to leave prison earlier than they otherwise would have. Many could secure an earlier release thanks to new credits awarded for good behavior or through participation in rehabilitation programs. The bill also eases some mandatory minimum sentences, gives judges more leeway to eschew certain sentencing guidelines and eliminates \"stacking\" provisions that leave offenders serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed with firearms.\n\n\"If this bill is the only step Congress takes, it will leave the important work of criminal justice reform substantially undone,\" said Ames C. Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. \"But as a real 'first step,' the bill both changes the conversation -- focusing on how we reduce federal prison sentences, not whether we do it at all -- and offers a real, immediate benefit for currently incarcerated people.\"\n\nA Democratic blockade\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries didn't want to be seen at the White House.\n\nThe New York Democrat represents parts of Brooklyn, one of the most anti-Trump districts in the country, and he was wary about the message his presence at the White House would send. So in the spring, when Kushner asked Jeffries to meet him at his office in the West Wing, he and Rep. Cedric Richmond, the Louisiana Democrat who's the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, refused. Instead, on March 22, Kushner came to them on Capitol Hill for breakfast. Jeffries, who had been working with Richmond on overhauling the criminal justice system for years, saw it as an early sign that Kushner was serious about the issue.\n\nStill, there was deep skepticism among Democrats. Many were averse to delivering Trump a win, and felt that simply being on the same side of an issue as the President was politically dangerous, particularly given his heated rhetoric over policing and inner city crime.\n\nIn 2016, Trump repeatedly spoke about bringing back controversial police practices, like stop and frisk, that disproportionately impact black and Latino men. When Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, said he would boycott Trump's inauguration in 2017, Trump tweeted in response that the civil rights icon \"should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.\"\n\nBut over months of meetings and calls with Kushner, Jeffries warmed to the idea that a criminal justice overhaul might be feasible under Trump. He found Kushner to be \"authentically committed\" and spent time talking with the President's son-in-law about the personal connection he had to the issue.\n\nKushner's father, Charles, served 14 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. Jeffries also found a willing cosponsor across the aisle in Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, a pastor who had seen his state's criminal justice overhaul efforts work to reduce recidivism rates.\n\nYet a difficult path lay ahead. First, Jeffries had to deal with critics in his own party.\n\nOn May 17, the Collins-Jeffries bill drew a fiery rebuke from some of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party, including Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The trio wrote a letter laying out the bill's faults as they saw them, including its lack of any sentencing revisions. The American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and other progressive groups opposed the bill.\n\nKushner offered to get involved but Jeffries insisted on handling it himself, according to Jones. In a day, Jeffries and his staffers wrote a point-by-point rebuttal to that letter while listening to the title tracks of one of the most famous rap battles, Jay-Z's \"Takeover\" and Nas' \"Ether.\" As they worked, Jeffries blasted the music on speakers in his office, according to an aide.\n\nThe next week, Jeffries stood up in a private House Democratic caucus meeting to defend his bill from the opposition of House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler of New York, former Attorney General Eric Holder and other powerful Democrats. \"What I recall is that Rep. Jeffries knew the bill in depth; answered questions fully; and removed the doubts of some completely,\" said Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California.\n\nA few days later, the bill passed the House with 360 votes, including nearly 70% of the House Democratic caucus and almost every Republican voting in favor of it.\n\n\"It's clear that some elements on the hard-left unleashed everything, including the kitchen sink, to try to stop the criminal justice reform effort in the House based on the worldview of all or nothing,\" Jeffries told CNN. \"In the House, we took the position that in order to break the back of the prison industrial complex we needed to begin with a significant, robust bipartisan effort around prison reform that could lay the foundation to get something done.\"\n\nAdministration opposition\n\nAs Jeffries was dealing with skeptical Democrats, Kushner was fighting with Republican opponents in the Trump administration, most notably then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nJared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, discusses US Mideast policy, prison reform, and what it's like working for President Donald Trump with CNN's Van Jones at the CITIZEN by CNN forum in New York.\n\nIn initial drafts, Sessions and his aides at the Justice Department worked to insert provisions that advocates of the bill considered \"poison pills,\" including introducing a new mandatory minimum sentence -- drawing uproar from Kushner's new Democratic partners, who questioned whether the political risk of associating with the White House would be worth it.\n\n\"Jared and others at the White House who were working on this went to bat for us,\" said Jessica Jackson Sloan, who along with Jones co-founded #Cut50, a group that advocates for reducing incarceration in the US. \"Jared said, 'I'm going to make sure this is right and I'm not going to let this crap happen again.' \"\n\n\"That was huge,\" Jones said.\n\nWithin weeks, Jones returned the favor by appearing alongside Kushner at a May 18 White House event focused on the prison legislation. Just walking into the Trump White House, Jones said, felt like \"political suicide.\" He and others who appeared onstage were assailed as \"Uncle Toms\" on social media.\n\n\"They didn't really understand why we were going,\" said Topeka Sam, a former felon who attended the White House event. \"The way we looked at it was, it's our house and despite who's in there, it's our country. And if we're looking to change what's happening to our people that are incarcerated, that we need to be at the table.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See Kanye and Trump's full White House meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See Kanye and Trump's full White House meeting 19:47\n\nBut the event offered proof of the bipartisan union that was coming together -- with left- and right-leaning advocates in attendance. It was also an indication that Trump was edging in favor of the bill.\n\nSeated in the front row of the gold-trimmed East Room, Mark Holden, senior vice president of Koch Industries, which has long advocated for criminal justice revisions, watched as Trump strayed from the teleprompter to make an off-script point about how a friend had hired some former prisoners who had turned out to be \"superstars.\" \"They would have never gotten the chance,\" said Trump.\n\nTo Holden and several administration officials, the riff was a sign that Trump wasn't just going through the motions. He was in. It was also a notable affront to Sessions, who was also seated in the front row.\n\nAround the time of the event, Sessions attended a meeting at the White House with Trump, Kushner and Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- another longtime advocate of criminal justice revisions. Sessions came armed with a memorandum laying out his arguments against the bill. But he didn't get far before Trump shut him down, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nIt didn't help that by then, Sessions had become a regular target of Trump's ire over his recusal from the Russia investigation. The mere fact that Sessions opposed the effort was almost enough to make the President support it.\n\n\"Trump liked the idea of overruling Sessions,\" said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter getting his hair cut at the Senate barbershop Tuesday, Sessions declined to talk to CNN about the First Step Act on the record.\n\nAugust setback\n\nBy August, momentum was building behind the bill.\n\nEarly that month, the President huddled at his Bedminster golf club with a group of Republican governors supportive of a criminal justice overhaul. There -- as he would in the Oval Office a month later -- Trump raised his concerns that he could face a Willie Horton moment of his own if he backed a bill that would grant early release to some convicted felons. The governors, a senior administration official said, helped assuage Trump's concern and pointed him to the benefit of sentencing overhauls in their states.\n\nBut then -- just as supporters of the bill expected a presidential endorsement was afoot -- Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, managed to get face time with Trump while he was at the White House, reviving the President's fears of Horton and reminding him of the political danger of endorsing the bill. That same day, McConnell told Trump the prison overhaul bill was too divisive among Republicans to bring to a vote before the midterm elections, multiple sources familiar with the call told CNN.\n\nUnder pressure, Trump agreed to table the issue until after the midterms.\n\nJUST WATCHED Jared Kushner full interview with Van Jones Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jared Kushner full interview with Van Jones 43:44\n\n\"At that point, we thought everything had died,\" said Jones.\n\nKushner extracted a promise from McConnell to bring the bill to a vote after the midterms if a whip count showed they had the votes. The delay gave supporters a chance to regroup and expand their coalition. Kushner began calling Sen. Mike Lee of Utah so frequently that when he interrupted Lee's family dinner during a vacation in Canada, they knew who it was. \"My family said, 'Oh it's Jared, isn't it?' \" Lee recalled.\n\nTo gain the backing of law enforcement groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police, and National District Attorneys Associations, supporters offered a few key concessions, including one that excludes people convicted of certain fentanyl-related offenses from being eligible for early release. That helped undercut the position of Cotton and other opponents, and positioned Kushner to present a strengthened bill to the President.\n\nMcConnell boxed in\n\nOn November 14, Trump delivered his endorsement in the White House Roosevelt Room, giving shout-outs to a number of Republican senators who wrote the revised bill -- Chuck Grassley , Lindsey Graham, Lee, Tim Scott, Rand Paul -- and Rep. Collins, an original co-author.\n\nBy then, most Senate Democrats had also jumped on board after some key sentencing provisions were added, including one that Senate Democratic Whip Durbin fought for in 2010 that reduced the disparity between sentences for powder vs. crack cocaine. The new legislation will apply that change retroactively to about 2,600 inmates who had been convicted under the previous statute.\n\nThere was still just one problem: McConnell was dragging his feet . The day after Trump gave his endorsement, the Senate majority leader told Trump in the Oval Office that he would not bring the measure up for a vote until next year, two administration officials said, pushing the careful compromise into the pit of divided government just as Democrats regain control of the House. Advocates were worried that decision could kill the bill, just as McConnell's reluctance to bring up a previous Senate bill sponsored by his whip, Sen. John Cornyn, and others stifled another effort at the end of the Obama administration.\n\nKushner and his allies began to ramp up pressure on McConnell. Conservatives flooded his office with calls, including thousands organized by the conservative grassroots group FreedomWorks, which also mounted a pressure campaign in Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn's home state of Texas.\n\nMcConnell needed to \"hear from everyone who matters to him and that the cost to him of not doing this was going to be greater\" than moving forward, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Trump put on the pressure, urging McConnell several times over the phone to bring the bill to the floor. And while some urged the President to attack McConnell on Twitter, Kushner convinced him to hold his fire, trusting McConnell would ultimately relent.\n\nLee unleashed\n\nBy the end of the month, Cornyn's office was telling the White House they didn't have the votes, claiming support for the bill was softer than it appeared, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nEven after Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House legislative affairs team did their own whip count and concluded they had over 60 votes, McConnell still wouldn't commit to bringing the bill to a vote before the end of the year. So Lee went into overdrive, lobbying his fellow senators day and night, by phone, by text, in person on the Senate floor, at lunch in the Senate cafeteria. \"I went nuts,\" Lee told CNN.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Lee's friend, the conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, signed on after they added certain provisions that would make it harder for some offenders to get an early release. Cruz was number \"29 or 30\" in Lee's mind -- more than enough to get the bill up for a vote and easily pass the Senate.\n\nOn December 10, Darrell Scott, a black pastor and early Trump supporter, warned McConnell's legal counsel that he would send hundreds of black pastors and activists -- in his words, \"500 angry black people\" -- to the Senate majority leader's office if he didn't take action.\n\nThat evening, Kushner made his most public push yet, appearing on Trump's favorite show -- \"Hannity\" on Fox News -- to plug the bill.\n\nThe next day, McConnell announced he would put the bill on the floor at the request of the President. Scott called McConnell to shower him with praise.\n\n\"I told him, 'We're going to build statues of you in the hood,' \" Scott recalled.\n\nA week later, on the day the bill passed the Senate, Jones and Kushner had an early-morning phone call to coordinate their efforts.\n\n\"The next 48 hours are critical,\" Jones jokingly told Kushner, echoing a phrase he had heard from Kushner at the end of nearly every one of their calls.\n\nBut the goal line was actually much closer, Kushner replied. \"I actually think it's only the next 12,\" he said.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Freedomworks is no longer associated with the Koch family."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump signed letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow project despite Giuliani insisting he didn't", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/L1bnym-_rdI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A newly obtained document shows President Donald Trump signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Russia, despite his attorney Rudy Giuliani claiming on Sunday the document was never signed.\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo obtained a copy of the signed letter of intent that set the stage for negotiations for Trump condominiums, a hotel and commercial property in the heart of Moscow.

Of those surveyed, 18.6% said they've done so.\n\nThat's an increase from 14.3% of women from 2011 to 2015.\n\nBut that number is very much tied to age. Nearly 2 in 5 women ages 40 to 49, or more than 39%, relied on their sterilization for contraception. For women 30 to 39, the figure was about 1 in 5, or more than 21.5%. And for women 20 to 29, only 1 in 20, or about 4%, had had a tubal ligation.\n\n\"Sterilization has been a common form of contraception both due to its permanence and ability to have it done after delivery of a child when someone is already getting health care,\" Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist and board member for the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, wrote in an email. \"Many poor women may not have access to contraception outside of a childbirth (where emergency insurance is often obtainable) so may want something convenient and long lasting.\"\n\nThe pill\n\nThe second most common contraceptive method was the birth control pill. About 12.6% of women reported relying on the pill as contraception.\n\nThat's a decrease from 15.9% from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe new report found that the pill, as it's known, was most popular among women 20 to 29 (19.5%), followed by those 15 to 19 (16.6%) and then 30 to 39 (11%), followed by only slightly more than 5% of women 40 to 49.\n\n\"The pill and permanent sterilization for women have been the most common method of contraception since 1982, according to the Guttmacher institute,\" wrote Dr. Lillian Schapiro, an Atlanta gynecologist in private practice, in an email.\n\nLong-acting contraception\n\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives, including intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, were used by 10.3% of respondents, making them the third most common method.\n\nThis is an increase from 2011 to 2015, when they were used by 8% of those surveyed.\n\nThe new report found use was highest for women ages 20 to 29 (13.1%), followed by those 30 to 39 (11.7%). More than 8% of respondents 15 to 19 used these methods, while less than 7% of women 40 to 49 did.\n\n\"LARC's are very safe now and becoming much more accepted,\" Schapiro wrote. \"For women not ready to permanently prevent pregnancy they are a great option since they don't require remembering a pill every day and keeping up to date on a prescription.\"\n\nMale condoms\n\nMale condoms were the fourth most common method, used by 8.7% of those surveyed.\n\nThat's a decline from 9.2% of respondents reporting use from 2011 to 2015.\n\nNow, women 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 used condoms the most: 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively. Just more than 5% of respondents 15 to 19 and 40 to 49 relied on condoms for contraception.\n\nOther methods\n\nMale sterilization, or vasectomies, was relied on by 5.9% of women. That's an increase from 4.5% of those surveyed from 2011 to 2015.\n\nDepo-Provera (a birth control shot), the contraceptive ring or the patch accounted for 3.2% of used methods. And all other methods were used with 5.6% of women.\n\n\"The pill and sterilization are our oldest forms of birth control and women are more familiar with them, so many women use what they are familiar with. However, as newer devices come unto the market and become popular, that may change,\" Brandi said.\n\nThe new report found that contraceptive use went up with age, with 37.2% of women 15 to 19, 61.9% of those 20 to 29, 72% of women 30 to 39 and 73.7% of women 40 to 49 using contraception.\n\nContraceptive pill use was highest among non-Hispanic white women (14.9%); 9.2% of Hispanic women and 8.3% of non-Hispanic black women reported relying on the pill.\n\nCondom use and long-acting reversible contraceptive use, across racial backgrounds, did not differ with any significance.\n\nEducation levels also made a difference in what methods women used. The higher the level of education, the less likely a woman was to rely on sterilization. Of women who were sterilized, 41.9% had no high school diploma or GED, 32.1% had a high school diploma or GED, 23.7% had some college education, and 11.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nConversely, use of the pill went up according to education levels. Of those who relied on contraceptive pills, 4.9% had no high school degree or GED, 7% had a high school degree or GED, 10.1% had some college, and 16.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\n\"It is important to understand what certain demographics are using so we understand their preferences and make sure that everyone has access to all forms of contraception,\" Brandi noted.\n\nThe 35% of women who were not using contraception when they were interviewed were either not sexually active (17%), were pregnant, were postpartum or were looking to get pregnant (7.5%), nonusers of contraception who'd been sexually active (7.9%) or nonusers for other reasons, like nonsurgical sterility (2.7%)."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "New year brings altered landscape for abortion battle", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/tLxnC9ySkhc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Those engaged in the battle over abortion in the United States are looking out at the thorny landscape and gearing up for what is on the horizon in 2019.\n\nWhat they see includes a more conservative US Supreme Court, 85 confirmed judges appointed by President Donald Trump who are reshaping the courts, and legislative bodies -- both state and federal -- transformed by a contentious midterm election.\n\nExperts from four groups dedicated to protecting abortion access spoke with reporters on a conference callMonday afternoon to discuss what lies ahead from their perspective. On the call were representatives from the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Network of Abortion Funds\n\nThey spoke of the more than 400-and-counting restrictions to abortion access that have been enacted at the state level since 2010 and vowed that this is not a time to stop fighting. Even though Roe v. Wade remains on the books, they said, some states forge ahead as if it has been overturned. They also discussed how barriers to abortion access effectively prohibit the procedure for many, especially for low-income populations, people of color and younger people.\n\n\"Even today,\" said Jennifer Davlen, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , \"the constitutional right to abortion is more theoretical than real.\"\n\nCourt rulings that deny restrictions simply get ignored or appealed, said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nShe said Louisiana, which has only three abortion clinics, is trying to enact laws to close clinics that are identical to a Texas effort that was struck down by the Supreme Court two years ago in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt.\n\nBy instituting \"systematic barriers,\" states are chipping away at what should be protected, said Rachel Sussman, national director of state policy and advocacy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America\n\nThat means the threat to Roe v. Wade remains strong, even as the support of it has grown, they said. Several mentioned a Gallup Poll from the summer that showed nearly two-thirds of Americans -- or 64% -- want to uphold the 1973 Supreme Court decision, including 41% of Republicans.\n\nSussman pointed out how three states -- Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan -- kicked out anti-abortion governors. And other states, including New York, Rhode Island and New Mexico, worked to codify protections for abortion access.\n\n\"Voters did their jobs at the polls,\" she said. \"Now, we're going to get to work to put their will into action.\"\n\nThe US Supreme Court announced this month that it would not take up a case that might have stopped Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the court chose to honor two lower court decisions that prohibited cuts to funding in Kansas and Louisiana. The high court's decision was backed by new Justice Brett Kavanaugh, making some wonder whether he might not be as conservative as anticipated.\n\nHe and Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to side with the court's liberals, signaling an effort to avoid high-profile abortion-related issues for now.\n\nThat said, both justices \"likely have serious objections,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"But such votes seem to be a signal that they would rather avoid contentious, high-profile disputes for now, at least where possible.\"\n\nA representative from Planned Parenthood insisted Monday that this was a case about Medicaid, not abortion, and that Kavanaugh's \"troubling record\" showed he couldn't be trusted.\n\nSteven Aden, chief legal officer and legal counsel at Americans United for Life, also refused to take the Supreme Court decision as a sign.\n\n\"We're not drawing any conclusions,\" he said. \"There are a number of reasons why the court could have elected not to take the case.\"\n\nAmericans United for Life is a national anti-abortion group that uses legislation, education and litigation to advance its cause. Aden said he's looking ahead with optimism, focusing on the legislative issues and fights that he imagines down the pipeline.\n\nSpecifically, he highlighted four model pieces of legislation his organization has written that he hopes will gain traction next year across the country.\n\nThe Abortion Reporting Act seeks to require reporting of all abortion-related complications and emergencies, the idea being that the procedure is \"practiced in the dark,\" Aden said. \"Only when such a system is in place will we finally be able to unmask the reality of abortion in America.\"\n\nThe Women's Health Defense Act seeks to ban abortions at or after 20 weeks of gestation, except in some cases of medical emergency. \"Abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more dangerous to a woman than carrying to term,\" he said.\n\nThe Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act forbids selective abortions \"seeking to target babies,\" Aden said, based on prenatal diagnostic testing that shows the gender of the baby or a diagnosis such as Down syndrome.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLastly, Aden pointed to the Unborn Infants Dignity Act, which he said \"treats human lives in the womb as just that, human,\" and requires \"cremation or proper burial\" of \"miscarried, stillborn or aborted infants\" and protection from \"scientific experimentation.\"\n\nAll of these efforts are precisely what proponents of abortion access are preparing to address.

However, they mistakenly believe e-cigarettes are \"cool\" and \"safe,\" he added.\n\n\"Studies show youth like my son [who is 14] have no clue what's in these products,\" Adams said. Meanwhile, a third of kids who have used e-cigs have used marijuana in them.\n\n\"The bottom line,\" according to Alex Azar, the US secretary of health and human services, is that \"in the datasets we use, we have never seen use of any substance rise this rapidly.\"\n\nThe percentage of high school-age children reporting past 30-day use of e-cigarettes rose by more than 75% between 2017 and 2018, while use among middle school-age kids increased nearly 50%, the National Youth Tobacco Survey showed. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health's Monitoring the Future survey , released Monday, recorded a single year surge with more than 37% of 12th graders reporting use in the past year compared to nearly 28% in 2017.\n\nThe skyrocketing rise in e-cigarettes comes at a time when there are \"encouraging signs elsewhere\" -- namely, the fact that alcohol use, tobacco use and opioid use among youth have declined, Azar said.\n\nHowever, the epidemic of vaping could contribute to \"a whole generation addicted to nicotine,\" he said noting that no amount of nicotine is safe.\n\n\"I'm talking about my own kids,\" Adams said. \"My 14, 13 and 9-year-olds are all familiar to these products since elementary school.\"\n\nMisconceptions and myths surrounding e-cigarettes contribute to the epidemic, he added. Meanwhile, parents do not even know what signs to look for or what questions to ask their kids.\n\nWhich is why Adams took the step of issuing an advisory. It's the second time he's taken such action. In April , he issued an advisory to get more Americans to carry the opioid overdose antidote naloxone.\n\nE-cigarettes are not harmless\n\nLike regular cigarettes, most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, an addictive drug that harms the developing brains of teens. Because the brain continues to develop until about age 25, nicotine's negative health effects include damage to learning, memory and attention abilities. Add to that, teens who use nicotine are at increased risk for addiction to other drugs.\n\n\"The number one reason teens say they use these products is because they say they have flavors in them,\" said Adams, who noted that many e-cigarettes come in kid-friendly flavors.\n\nSarah Ryan, a high school senior from Holbrook, Massachusetts, who also spoke at the news conference, said there are over 8,000 flavors. Some \"taste like Sour Patch Kids,\" she said. The flavors hide the nicotine, which most kids don't even know is there, she added.\n\nSome of the chemicals used to make certain flavors may also pose health risks, according to Adams. In addition to nicotine, the vapor from e-cigs may include other harmful substances, including heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.\n\nWhile e-cigarettes may contain less harmful chemicals than other tobacco products, Adams cautioned, \"Less harm does not mean harmless.\"\n\nSpreading like 'wildfire' in high school\n\nKids, though, believe it's just \"water and flavor,\" said school substance abuse counselor Mila Vascones-Gatski who also spoke at the news conference. The smell is more difficult to detect and the cloud of vapor dissipates so quickly it's hard for anyone to see, though increasingly teachers report kids are vaping in a classroom. \"How do we know? They take selfies of themselves vaping in the classroom,\" she said.\n\nThe surge in e-cigarette use among teens has been fueled by cartridge-based devices, which look like a USB flash drive. The newest devices are not only easy to conceal but most parents would not recognize them as anything other than a tech item. The most ubiquitous version is called Juul, which now has more than a 70% share of the cartridge-based e-cigarette market in the United States, according to the surgeon general.\n\nA typical Juul cartridge, or \"pod,\" contains about as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.\n\nRyan said a sixth-grader told her, \"it was easier to get someone to loan him a Juul than a pencil.\"\n\nShe also said that this year, e-cigarette use \"really spread like wildfire.\" Her high school had to shut down one of the bathrooms due to vaping, she said, while some kids have been caught vaping during class. Meanwhile, she said a convenience store directly across the street from her school has sold e-cigarette products.\n\nTargeting those who sell to kids\n\nConvenience stores are one of the targets of the US Food and Drug Administration, according to Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who also spoke at the news conference. With him at the helm, the agency has taken aggressive steps and will continue to do so over the next couple of months. He hopes to limit both the access and appeal these products have to kids, which he will try to accomplish by stepping up enforcement activities at stores where kids get access to e-cigarettes.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's my belief that we've been successful in this country at stigmatizing tobacco products among kids,\" Gottlieb said. \"We haven't been effective stigmatizing e-cigarette use.\"\n\nAdams applauded the FDA in September for launching a campaign to prevent kids from using e-cigarettes.\n\nTuesday he recognized the potential of e-cigarettes as a tool of harm reduction among adults who are addicted to traditional cigarettes, but added that today's conference prioritized alerting parents, teachers and health officials about the dangers of youth e-cigarette use.\n\n\"We will not stand for another year of exponential rise in the use of these products,\" Adams said. \"We're far too often -- in health and public health -- late to the game.

Down the line, risks may include physical dependence and overdose.\n\n\"The benefits of opioids for managing chronic pain tend to be quite modest,\" said study author Jason Busse, associate professor in the department of anesthesia at McMaster University's school of medicine in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSubgroups of the studies included in the analysis suggest that non-opioid alternatives -- such as NSAIDs, certain antidepressants and medical cannabis -- may offer similar benefits to opioids on average. But the evidence for that is less strong, Busse said.\n\nThe analysis comes as federal agencies and other officials in recent years have been cracking down on the prescription of opioids, dually recognized as an important tool in the treatment of pain and as a gateway to physical dependence and addiction.\n\nIn 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines urging doctors to prescribe these drugs more responsibly for people with chronic pain. But Busse said the CDC report set the bar for placebo-controlled studies too high in its analysis; it looked for studies that followed up with patients for at least a year, of which there were none.\n\n\"We have looked at a lot of additional evidence that was not considered by the CDC guidelines,\" he said.\n\nDr. Jianguo Cheng, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said the new analysis reinforces what's become conventional wisdom among pain specialists. He was not involved in the study.\n\n\"We're going to try the least risky drug first, so therefore opioids [are] not a first line of treatment in most cases,\" said Cheng, also the director of director of the Cleveland Clinic Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship Program. \"It's not a second line of treatment, and maybe not a third line of treatment.\"\n\nThe CDC describes chronic pain as \"lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing.\" It is among the top reasons for seeking medical care in the US, affecting just over 20% of adults -- about 50 million people -- in 2016, according to one report this year. Other estimates suggest that the number is twice that.\n\n\"It's a very complicated and diverse population of patients,\" Cheng said, including those who may have suffered injuries, had multiple surgeries or live with disability.\n\nThis is differentiated from other kinds of pain, such as acute pain and cancer pain. For the latter, Cheng said, the use of opioids is far less controversial.\n\nJust because most of these patients won't see meaningful improvements, however, is not to ignore the subset that will experience them, Busse said.\n\n\"A problematic interpretation of [the study findings] would be: Opioids don't provide any meaningful pain relief,\" he said. \"The challenge with that interpretation is it assumes that every patient will get the same amount of pain relief.\"\n\nHis study estimates how many chronic pain patients a doctor would need to treat in order for one to experience meaningful improvements: For pain, it's roughly eight patients. For physical functioning, it's 12 patients. For sleep quality, 17 patients.\n\nAnd this is the \"best case scenario,\" according to an editorial published in the same journal by doctors with the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care.\n\nThe studies included in the analysis largely weeded out patients with past or present substance use disorder, which Busse described as \"selecting patients that would be prognostically better off.\" Nearly half of the studies excluded patients who were diagnosed with or treated for mental illness, as well.\n\nMore than three-quarters of studies in the analysis were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the study points out. Other research has shown that industry-funded studies tend to produce better outcomes across a variety of fields.\n\nIn recent years, pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for aggressively marketing opioids to doctors. Leading up to the early 2000s, opioids were seen as a wonder drug , and doctors were urged to treat pain more aggressively. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in an open letter that doctors were taught that these medications were not addictive if patients were in \"legitimate pain.\" Multiple studies have shown this to be false.\n\n2013 study estimated that one in five patients who see a doctor for acute or chronic noncancer pain get prescribed opioids.\n\nAnother study last year supported a push by the CDC and other health experts to taper chronic pain patients off opioids when possible, saying they may have a better quality of life without them. But Cheng says this should be done carefully and may not work immediately for all patients, adding, \"I have seen many patients abandoned by their physicians, and they cannot find the people to manage their pain.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAccording to Cheng, alternative treatments that may be effective -- such as physical and cognitive behavioral therapies -- can also be out of reach for many patients, in some cases because insurance doesn't reimburse these services.\n\nHowever, despite gaps in knowledge of treating chronic pain, experts say opioids are part of that arsenal -- even if they come with risks and benefits that need to be better understood.\n\n\"For individuals who are suffering with unrelenting chronic pain every day of their lives, if they've tried other alternatives that haven't worked, they may in some cases decide they still want to embark on a trial of [opioid] therapy,\" Busse said, \"and now they have the evidence to understand what their chances are of achieving meaningful improvement.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "#JUUL: How social media hyped nicotine for a new generation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sg8EfdZOZ54/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs has tried to distance itself from a vast social media presence that experts say drives its popularity among teens. But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nChristina Zayas was paid to post about Juul on her Instagram. The post has now been deleted.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick.

The delay in publication was partly down to a dispute between ministers over a possible \u00a330,000 salary threshold for skilled workers.\n\nBut it's the plan to create a route into Britain for unskilled or low-skilled workers which is likely to prove particularly controversial.\n\nThe document says the reason for the route is that some sectors have built up a \"reliance\" on such staff from the EU and require a \"period of time\" to adjust to the end of freedom of movement.\n\nBut the new scheme will be in place until at least 2025; it'll be open to those in other \"low-risk\" countries, not just the EU; and there is currently no numerical cap.\n\nIt raises the prospect that the immigration system the government is designing is as much about ensuring there's a flow of unskilled labour, as it is about skilled workers.\n\nNo cap on high-skilled workers\n\nThe White Paper introduces a new visa route for skilled migrants, from Europe and beyond.\n\nIt accepts a recommendation from the independent Migration Advisory Committee to scrap the current limit of 20,700 on workers classed as high-skilled coming to the UK using \"Tier 2\" visas.\n\nTier 2 is the name for general work visas for people from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Eligible professions include nurses and doctors.\n\nThere will be a consultation about the salary threshold of \u00a330,000 for skilled worker visas, amid opposition to such a cap from business and some cabinet members.\n\nThe \u00a330,000 minimum earnings rule already applies to non-EU workers in most Tier 2 visa cases but could also apply to migrants from the EU.\n\nExtending it to skilled migrants could affect the NHS's ability to recruit the staff it needs, the body representing NHS trusts has warned.\n\nNHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told Today: \"We are deeply concerned about what is going to happen. High skills does not equal high pay.\n\n\"You have got starting salaries for nurses at \u00a323,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at \u00a327,000, healthcare assistants at \u00a317,000, all coming in way below that \u00a330,000 cap.\n\n\"It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay. They lay in those staff under \u00a330,000.\"\n\nThe document also suggests the changes could have a negative economic impact, reducing annual output, or GDP, by between 0.4% and 0.9% by 2025.\n\nLabour, SNP and business reaction\n\nDuring a BBC interview, Mr Javid repeatedly declined to say whether the government's target of reducing net migration - the difference between the numbers of people leaving the UK for at least a year and those moving to the UK for at least a year - to less than 100,000 would still apply after Brexit.\n\nBut, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May confirmed the government was sticking to the \"tens of thousands\" ambition.\n\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government had \"disgracefully labelled workers on less than \u00a330,000 as low-skilled\" when \"our economy and public services are kept ticking by this majority of workers\".\n\n\"The government is not, as it wrongly claims, using a skills-based criteria to meet the needs of our economy and our society.\n\n\"It is using an income-based system which allows derivatives traders free movement but which excludes nurses, social care workers and other professions in which we have severe skills or labour shortages.\"\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's plans would be \"devastating for the Scottish economy\" because \"our demographics make it essential that we attract people to live and work here\".\n\nBusiness groups said the salary threshold would need to be lower than \u00a330,000 and warned the proposals could \"tie the hands\" of employers\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Employers are hugely concerned that the complexity and cost associated with new immigration rules will impact their ability to invest and grow at a time when many areas are facing near-full employment.\"\n\nWho counts as a high-skilled worker?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nCurrently, someone is eligible to apply for a \"Tier 2\" general work visa - which can last for up to five years - if they are from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\n\nThey must also have been offered a high-skilled job in the UK - which is any profession ranked at level six and above on a list called the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) - and which has not been filled by a UK worker.\n\nThe high-skilled category includes a range of professions such as doctors, nurses, musicians, aircraft pilots, brokers, paramedics, librarians, journalists, food inspectors, probation officers, social workers, surveyors, architects, lawyers, and some teachers.\n\nIn most cases, the migrant will need to be earning at least \u00a330,000 per year (or \u00a320,800 for new entrants), or the \"appropriate rate\" for their job if that figure is higher.

a document setting out proposed new laws before they are formalised in a government bill - also includes:\n\nScrapping the current cap on the number of skilled workers such as doctors or engineers from the EU and elsewhere\n\nA consultation on a minimum salary requirement of \u00a330,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas\n\nVisitors from the EU will not need visas\n\nPlans to phase in the new system from 2021\n\nMr Javid said the proposals would enable the UK to exercise control over its borders and \"deliver on the clear instruction\" of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.\n\nThe ending of free movement from Europe is a key part of Mrs May's Brexit deal, although any replacement system is set to be part of post-Brexit trade talks.\n\n12-month visas for lower-skilled workers\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe government says lower-skilled and unskilled migrants will not routinely be able to come to the UK and settle permanently.\n\nHowever, as a \"transitional measure\", people from \"low-risk countries\" in Europe and further afield will be able to come to the UK, without a job offer, and seek work for up to a year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to fill vacancies in sectors such as construction and social care which are heavily dependent on EU labour and which ministers fear could struggle to adapt when free movement ends.\n\nThere will be a \"cooling off period\" after a year, meaning people will be expected to leave at that point and not to apply again for a further 12 months.\n\nMinisters say applicants, who will have to pay a fee and not get access to public funds, will not be able to switch to any other migration scheme.\n\nIt is understood that the numbers being admitted this way would be \"similar\" to the 170,000 workers from outside the European Economic Area currently in low or unskilled roles.\n\nThe government said it reserved the right to tighten the criteria or impose numerical caps prior to a review in 2025 but campaigners for lower migration said the plans were \"astonishing\".\n\nMigration Watch said there was no way of making sure people left after a year and the immigration figures, which do not include people in the UK for less than a year, could be distorted as a result.\n\n\"It is shocking that the government should have caved in so completely to the demands of industry while ignoring the strong public desire to get immigration down,\" said its chair Lord Green.\n\n\"The chief winners will be business, as they exploit the bonanza of a huge new pool of labour from around the world while continuing to avoid their responsibility to the public to recruit and train up local talent.\"\n\nAnalysis: Routes into Britain\n\nThe BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw\n\nThe White Paper was trailed as creating an immigration system based on \"skills\". The delay in publication was partly down to a dispute between ministers over a possible \u00a330,000 salary threshold for skilled workers.\n\nBut it's the plan to create a route into Britain for unskilled or low-skilled workers which is likely to prove particularly controversial.\n\nThe document says the reason for the route is that some sectors have built up a \"reliance\" on such staff from the EU and require a \"period of time\" to adjust to the end of freedom of movement.\n\nBut the new scheme will be in place until at least 2025; it'll be open to those in other \"low-risk\" countries, not just the EU; and there is currently no numerical cap.\n\nIt raises the prospect that the immigration system the government is designing is as much about ensuring there's a flow of unskilled labour, as it is about skilled workers.\n\nNo cap on high-skilled workers\n\nThe White Paper introduces a new visa route for skilled migrants, from Europe and beyond.\n\nIt accepts a recommendation from the independent Migration Advisory Committee to scrap the current limit of 20,700 on workers classed as high-skilled coming to the UK using \"Tier 2\" visas.\n\nTier 2 is the name for general work visas for people from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Eligible professions include nurses and doctors.\n\nThere will be a consultation about the salary threshold of \u00a330,000 for skilled worker visas, amid opposition to such a cap from business and some cabinet members.\n\nThe \u00a330,000 minimum earnings rule already applies to non-EU workers in most Tier 2 visa cases but could also apply to migrants from the EU.\n\nExtending it to skilled migrants could affect the NHS's ability to recruit the staff it needs, the body representing NHS trusts has warned.\n\nNHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told Today: \"We are deeply concerned about what is going to happen. High skills does not equal high pay.\n\n\"You have got starting salaries for nurses at \u00a323,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at \u00a327,000, healthcare assistants at \u00a317,000, all coming in way below that \u00a330,000 cap.\n\n\"It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay. They lay in those staff under \u00a330,000.\"\n\nThe document also suggests the changes could have a negative economic impact, reducing annual output, or GDP, by between 0.4% and 0.9% by 2025.\n\nLabour, SNP and business reaction\n\nDuring a BBC interview, Mr Javid repeatedly declined to say whether the government's target of reducing net migration - the difference between the numbers of people leaving the UK for at least a year and those moving to the UK for at least a year - to less than 100,000 would still apply after Brexit.\n\nBut, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May confirmed the government was sticking to the \"tens of thousands\" ambition.\n\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government had \"disgracefully labelled workers on less than \u00a330,000 as low-skilled\" when \"our economy and public services are kept ticking by this majority of workers\".\n\n\"The government is not, as it wrongly claims, using a skills-based criteria to meet the needs of our economy and our society.\n\n\"It is using an income-based system which allows derivatives traders free movement but which excludes nurses, social care workers and other professions in which we have severe skills or labour shortages.\"\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's plans would be \"devastating for the Scottish economy\" because \"our demographics make it essential that we attract people to live and work here\".\n\nBusiness groups said the salary threshold would need to be lower than \u00a330,000 and warned the proposals could \"tie the hands\" of employers\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Employers are hugely concerned that the complexity and cost associated with new immigration rules will impact their ability to invest and grow at a time when many areas are facing near-full employment.\"\n\nWho counts as a high-skilled worker?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nCurrently, someone is eligible to apply for a \"Tier 2\" general work visa - which can last for up to five years - if they are from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\n\nThey must also have been offered a high-skilled job in the UK - which is any profession ranked at level six and above on a list called the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) - and which has not been filled by a UK worker.\n\nThe high-skilled category includes a range of professions such as doctors, nurses, musicians, aircraft pilots, brokers, paramedics, librarians, journalists, food inspectors, probation officers, social workers, surveyors, architects, lawyers, and some teachers.\n\nIn most cases, the migrant will need to be earning at least \u00a330,000 per year (or \u00a320,800 for new entrants), or the \"appropriate rate\" for their job if that figure is higher. Some professions, like nurses, are exempt.\n\nPeople who do jobs which the UK needs - on the shortage occupation list - are also eligible to apply for the Tier 2 visa, even if the job is less highly-skilled and ranked at RQF level four."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Scottish woman, 64, shot dead outside her home in US", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-46619802", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:36", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Facebook/Google Image caption Liz Sutherland was shot dead outside her apartment building\n\nA Scottish woman has been shot dead outside her home in the US.\n\nLiz Sutherland, 64, was killed after she got out of her car at her apartment building in Birmingham, Alabama, on Saturday night.\n\nNewspaper reports in the US city said there was no apparent motive for the attack.

This is the product of calculation of what is in its interests and which vulnerabilities need to be protected.\n\nAnd the European Commission is clearly concerned about countries doing their own deals with the UK, hence a plea not to.\n\nBut the message from Brussels is clear: the deal that's on offer is way, way, way better than no deal at all.\n\nWhy are the plans being released now?\n\nThe European Commission's initial guidance on the issue was published in November.\n\nIt committed to publishing its draft version by the end of 2018, allowing for eight weeks of consultation, as required by EU treaties.\n\nThe issue is heating up because Mrs May's proposed deal, which was agreed with the EU, has so far failed to gain enough support in the UK Parliament, which will vote on it next month.\n\nThe deadline for leaving is now 100 days away.\n\nWhat is the UK doing?\n\nOn Tuesday, the cabinet said it had decided to \"ramp up\" preparations for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe government has sent letters to 140,000 firms urging them to plan ahead, while 3,500 troops will be put on standby to maintain essential services.\n\nIt will also distribute 100-page information packs to businesses on Friday.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, two years after triggering an EU mechanism known as Article 50, which covers departure from the bloc."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Immigration: White Paper sets out post-Brexit rules for migrants", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46613900", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The home secretary sidesteps a question about immigration targets\n\nTens of thousands of low-skilled migrants could come to the UK to work for up to a year under proposed new post-Brexit immigration rules.\n\nThe measure, which would last until 2025, is intended to protect parts of the economy reliant on overseas labour.\n\nThe idea was described as \"shocking\" by campaign group Migration Watch.\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid said the new system would be based on UK needs rather than where migrants were from and show the UK \"open for business\".\n\nUnveiling what he said would be the biggest shake-up of immigration policy for 40 years, Mr Javid said that while there was no \"specific target\" for reducing numbers coming into the UK, net migration would come down to \"sustainable levels\".\n\nThe much-delayed White Paper - a document setting out proposed new laws before they are formalised in a government bill - also includes:\n\nScrapping the current cap on the number of skilled workers such as doctors or engineers from the EU and elsewhere\n\nA consultation on a minimum salary requirement of \u00a330,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas\n\nVisitors from the EU will not need visas\n\nPlans to phase in the new system from 2021\n\nMr Javid said the proposals would enable the UK to exercise control over its borders and \"deliver on the clear instruction\" of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.\n\nThe ending of free movement from Europe is a key part of Mrs May's Brexit deal, although any replacement system is set to be part of post-Brexit trade talks.\n\n12-month visas for lower-skilled workers\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe government says lower-skilled and unskilled migrants will not routinely be able to come to the UK and settle permanently.\n\nHowever, as a \"transitional measure\", people from \"low-risk countries\" in Europe and further afield will be able to come to the UK, without a job offer, and seek work for up to a year.\n\nThe scheme is designed to fill vacancies in sectors such as construction and social care which are heavily dependent on EU labour and which ministers fear could struggle to adapt when free movement ends.\n\nThere will be a \"cooling off period\" after a year, meaning people will be expected to leave at that point and not to apply again for a further 12 months.\n\nMinisters say applicants, who will have to pay a fee and not get access to public funds, will not be able to switch to any other migration scheme.\n\nIt is understood that the numbers being admitted this way would be \"similar\" to the 170,000 workers from outside the European Economic Area currently in low or unskilled roles.\n\nThe government said it reserved the right to tighten the criteria or impose numerical caps prior to a review in 2025 but campaigners for lower migration said the plans were \"astonishing\".\n\nMigration Watch said there was no way of making sure people left after a year and the immigration figures, which do not include people in the UK for less than a year, could be distorted as a result.\n\n\"It is shocking that the government should have caved in so completely to the demands of industry while ignoring the strong public desire to get immigration down,\" said its chair Lord Green.\n\n\"The chief winners will be business, as they exploit the bonanza of a huge new pool of labour from around the world while continuing to avoid their responsibility to the public to recruit and train up local talent.\"\n\nAnalysis: Routes into Britain\n\nThe BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw\n\nThe White Paper was trailed as creating an immigration system based on \"skills\". The delay in publication was partly down to a dispute between ministers over a possible \u00a330,000 salary threshold for skilled workers.\n\nBut it's the plan to create a route into Britain for unskilled or low-skilled workers which is likely to prove particularly controversial.\n\nThe document says the reason for the route is that some sectors have built up a \"reliance\" on such staff from the EU and require a \"period of time\" to adjust to the end of freedom of movement.\n\nBut the new scheme will be in place until at least 2025; it'll be open to those in other \"low-risk\" countries, not just the EU; and there is currently no numerical cap.\n\nIt raises the prospect that the immigration system the government is designing is as much about ensuring there's a flow of unskilled labour, as it is about skilled workers.\n\nNo cap on high-skilled workers\n\nThe White Paper introduces a new visa route for skilled migrants, from Europe and beyond.\n\nIt accepts a recommendation from the independent Migration Advisory Committee to scrap the current limit of 20,700 on workers classed as high-skilled coming to the UK using \"Tier 2\" visas.\n\nTier 2 is the name for general work visas for people from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Eligible professions include nurses and doctors.\n\nThere will be a consultation about the salary threshold of \u00a330,000 for skilled worker visas, amid opposition to such a cap from business and some cabinet members.\n\nThe \u00a330,000 minimum earnings rule already applies to non-EU workers in most Tier 2 visa cases but could also apply to migrants from the EU.\n\nExtending it to skilled migrants could affect the NHS's ability to recruit the staff it needs, the body representing NHS trusts has warned.\n\nNHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told Today: \"We are deeply concerned about what is going to happen. High skills does not equal high pay.\n\n\"You have got starting salaries for nurses at \u00a323,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at \u00a327,000, healthcare assistants at \u00a317,000, all coming in way below that \u00a330,000 cap.\n\n\"It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay. They lay in those staff under \u00a330,000.\"\n\nThe document also suggests the changes could have a negative economic impact, reducing annual output, or GDP, by between 0.4% and 0.9% by 2025.\n\nLabour, SNP and business reaction\n\nDuring a BBC interview, Mr Javid repeatedly declined to say whether the government's target of reducing net migration - the difference between the numbers of people leaving the UK for at least a year and those moving to the UK for at least a year - to less than 100,000 would still apply after Brexit.\n\nBut, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May confirmed the government was sticking to the \"tens of thousands\" ambition.\n\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government had \"disgracefully labelled workers on less than \u00a330,000 as low-skilled\" when \"our economy and public services are kept ticking by this majority of workers\".\n\n\"The government is not, as it wrongly claims, using a skills-based criteria to meet the needs of our economy and our society.\n\n\"It is using an income-based system which allows derivatives traders free movement but which excludes nurses, social care workers and other professions in which we have severe skills or labour shortages.\"\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's plans would be \"devastating for the Scottish economy\" because \"our demographics make it essential that we attract people to live and work here\".\n\nBusiness groups said the salary threshold would need to be lower than \u00a330,000 and warned the proposals could \"tie the hands\" of employers\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Employers are hugely concerned that the complexity and cost associated with new immigration rules will impact their ability to invest and grow at a time when many areas are facing near-full employment.\"\n\nWho counts as a high-skilled worker?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nCurrently, someone is eligible to apply for a \"Tier 2\" general work visa - which can last for up to five years - if they are from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\n\nThey must also have been offered a high-skilled job in the UK - which is any profession ranked at level six and above on a list called the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) - and which has not been filled by a UK worker.\n\nThe high-skilled category includes a range of professions such as doctors, nurses, musicians, aircraft pilots, brokers, paramedics, librarians, journalists, food inspectors, probation officers, social workers, surveyors, architects, lawyers, and some teachers.\n\nIn most cases, the migrant will need to be earning at least \u00a330,000 per year (or \u00a320,800 for new entrants), or the \"appropriate rate\" for their job if that figure is higher. Some professions, like nurses, are exempt.\n\nPeople who do jobs which the UK needs - on the shortage occupation list - are also eligible to apply for the Tier 2 visa, even if the job is less highly-skilled and ranked at RQF level four."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Fiona Onasanya: Peterborough MP guilty in speeding case", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-46602635", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA Image caption Fiona Onasanya was issued a speeding ticket a week after she was elected as MP\n\nAn MP has been found guilty of perverting the course of justice by lying to police about who was behind the wheel of a speeding car.\n\nPeterborough MP Fiona Onasanya denied she was driving her car when it was caught doing 41mph in a 30mph zone in Thorney, Cambridgeshire, in July 2017.\n\nThe 35-year-old Labour MP was convicted in an Old Bailey retrial.\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said she had been \"administratively suspended\" and has called for her to resign.\n\nHe added: \"The Labour Party is deeply disappointed in Fiona Onasanya's behaviour.

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa hack exposes space agency staff's data", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46622467", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Nasa said employees who had worked for the agency since 2006 were at risk\n\nNasa has emailed its staff to warn them that hackers may have stolen their personal details.\n\nThe message said it suspected that two of its servers containing details of past and present employees had been compromised.\n\nIt added that it did not believe any Nasa mission had been put in jeopardy.\n\nOne expert noted that this was the latest in a series of breaches experienced by the space agency to have been made public since 2011.\n\nIn this case, the memo involved was published by the SpaceRef news site.\n\nIt said that a probe into the incidents had been ongoing since 23 October.\n\n\"Our entire leadership team takes the protection of personal information very seriously,\" it said.\n\n\"Nasa is continuing its efforts to secure all servers, and is reviewing its processes and procedures to ensure that the latest security practices are being followed throughout the agency.\"\n\nThe email added that social security numbers and other private information belonging to civil service employees of the agency who had worked for it since July 2006, might have been affected.\n\nPrevious attacks include an incident in which hackers took control of computers in Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2011, and an attack in 2013 that led to eight Nasa web domains being defaced by a gang calling itself the Master Italian Hackers Team.\n\n\"The public want to know that this government agency is learning from the past, we want the post-mortem,\" commented Sam Curry, chief security officer at Cybereason.\n\n\"There are many things at Nasa in the national security domain which are of vital importance.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Waste plan floats bottle deposit scheme", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46594380", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nConsumers will have to pay a returnable deposit on bottles, cans and disposable cups under a new government strategy.\n\nHomes in England will be provided by councils with separate collections for food waste.\n\nRecycling will be made less confusing for households, and manufacturers will need to foot the cost of disposing of the goods they produce.\n\nThe plan has been cautiously welcomed by green groups, but some business groups are wary.\n\nThe strategy is designed to help combat climate change, safeguard resources and reduce the flow of plastic to the ocean.\n\nCheck what you can recycle in your area\n\nPlastic recycling: How do bottle deposit schemes work?\n\nA passion for recycling: 'It's my day job'\n\nWhy are the changes needed?\n\nThe last waste strategy was set out 11 years ago and since then concern has boomed over climate change, the oceans and the way we use resources.\n\nRotting waste is a major source of greenhouse gases that are over-heating the planet.

It established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa.\n\n181214104213461\n\nAccording to US estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kilometres of territory, with about eight million people under its control. It had estimated revenues of nearly $1bn a year.\n\nBrett McGurk, US special envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, said last week that the group was down to its last one percent of the territory it once held in its self-styled \"caliphate\". The group has no remaining territory in Iraq.\n\nHajin, the group's last major stronghold in Syria, is close to being seized by US-backed SDF forces.\n\nAfter losing Hajin, ISIL will control a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates. The group also controls some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.\n\nBut US officials have warned that taking back the group's territory would not be the same as defeating it.\n\n\"Even as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative,\" McGurk told a State Department briefing on December 11.\n\n181211134022694\n\nUS Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cautioned earlier in December that the US had trained only about 20 percent of Syrian forces required to stabilise areas captured from ISIL.\n\n'Grave error'\n\nA complete withdrawal of US troops from Syria would still leave a sizeable US military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq.\n\nMuch of the US campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.\n\nStill, Mattis and US State Department officials have long fretted about leaving Syria before a peace agreement can be reached to end that country's brutal civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced around half of Syria\u2019s prewar population of about 22 million.\n\nIn April, Mattis said, \"We do not want to simply pull out before the diplomats have won the peace. You win the fight - and then you win the peace.\"\n\nISIL is also widely expected to revert to guerrilla tactics once it no longer holds territory. A US withdrawal could open Trump up to criticism if ISIL reemerged.\n\nTrump has previously lambasted his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq that preceded an unravelling of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of ISIL's advance into the country in 2014.\n\nReacting to reports of a possible troop withdrawal, Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham, often a Trump ally, said a withdrawal would have \"devastating consequences\" for the US in the region and throughout the world.\n\n\"An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS, Iran, (President) Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and Russia,\" Graham said in a statement.\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio agreed, saying a full and rapid withdrawal of US troops from Syria would be a \"grave error\" with implications beyond just the fight against ISIL.\n\nAdditional reporting by Umut Uras @Um_Uras."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Turkish media leaks more images of Khashoggi murder suspects", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/turkish-media-leaks-images-khashoggi-murder-suspects-181219175317541.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Turkish media has again leaked images of the Saudi suspects accused of murdering Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe new photos appear to show the so-called \"hit team\" arriving at the consulate in Istanbul.\n\nAl Jazeera's Charlotte Bellis reports."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "UAE says US-Taliban talks show 'positive' result", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/uae-taliban-talks-show-positive-result-181219155736429.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "The United Arab Emirates said talks it is hosting between the United States and the Taliban have yielded \"positive\" results.\n\nThe US-Taliban \"reconciliation talks\" produced \"tangible results that are positive for all parties concerned\", the UAE's official WAM news agency said on Wednesday.\n\nA new round of talks would be held in Abu Dhabi \"to complete the Afghanistan reconciliation process\", it said without providing further details.\n\nThe two days of meetings in the Emirati capital are Washington's latest attempt at ending Afghanistan's 17-year conflict, which has cost it nearly $1 trillion since 2011 when it led an invasion to overthrow the Taliban government of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks.\n\nPresident George W Bush's administration at the time accused the Afghan group of harbouring Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, which carried out the attacks.\n\nThe Taliban, which has not confirmed meeting Afghan officials, said it had held \"preliminary talks\" with the US envoy.\n\nUS envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said he had \"productive\" meetings in the UAE with Afghan and international partners \"to promote intra-Afghan dialogue towards ending the conflict\".\n\nKhalilzad tweeted he met with Pakistani officials on Wednesday to brief them before travelling to meet Afghan leaders in Kabul.\n\nHe said he would like to see a \"roadmap\" agreement reached before Afghan presidential elections, scheduled for April.\n\nIn another breakthrough, three representatives of the Haqqani network - Hafiz Yahya, Saadullah Hamas and Dr Faqeer - were also present at the talks, The Associated Press quoted an anonymous Taliban source as saying.\n\nAlthough part of the Taliban, the Haqqani network has its own military committee.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The president, however, has not been able to secure U.S. taxpayer funding for it even though both houses of Congress currently are under the control of his Republican Party.\n\nHe faces an even more daunting political challenge in the new year, when Democrats, who are adamantly opposed to the wall, take control of the House of Representatives, while Republicans retain their Senate majority.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump said, \"One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!\"\n\nTrump aide Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the U.S. leader would \"take a look at\" the stopgap funding plan, \"certainly.\"\n\nTrump last week said he would \"proudly\" own a shutdown in order to get $5 billion in funding for construction of a wall along the 3,200-kilometer border with Mexico; but, without enough votes in Congress, Trump retreated Tuesday, with the White House saying it would look for \"other ways\" to secure funding by trying to tap unused money from several federal agencies.\n\n\"We'll see what happens,\" Trump said. \"It's too early to say.

The federal government has placed most of the 14,300 migrant toddlers, children and teens in its care in detention centers and residential facilities packed with hundreds, or thousands, of children.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, some 5,400 detained migrant children in the U.S. are sleeping in shelters with more than 1,000 other children. Some 9,800 are in facilities with 100-plus total kids, according to confidential government data obtained and cross-checked by The Associated Press.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge shift from just three months after President Donald Trump took office, when the same federal program had 2,720 migrant youth in its care; most were in shelters with a few dozen kids or in foster programs. Some of the children may be released sooner than anticipated, because this week the administration ended a portion of its strict screening policies that had slowed the placement of migrant kids with relatives in the U.S.\n\nUntil now, public information has been limited about the number of youths held at each facility overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, even for attorneys representing the kids. But the AP obtained data showing the number of children in individual detention centers, shelters and foster care programs for nearly every week over the past 20 months, revealing in detail the expanse of a program at the center of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe data shows the degree to which the government\u2019s approach to migrant youth has hardened, marking a new phase in a federal program originally intended to offer safe haven to vulnerable children fleeing danger across the globe. It\u2019s been taking at least twice as long \u2014 on average two months rather than one \u2014 for youth held inside the system to get out, in part because the Trump administration added more restrictive screening measures for parents and relatives who would take them in.\n\nThat changed Tuesday when the administration ended a policy requiring every adult in households where migrant children will live to provide the government with fingerprints. All still must submit to background checks, and parents themselves still need to be fingerprinted. Nonetheless, officials said they could now process some children more rapidly, and hoped to shorten shelter stays that had dragged on so long kids sometimes wondered if their parents had abandoned them for good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pain we will never get through,\u201d said Cecilio Ramirez Castaneda, a Salvadoran whose 12-year-old son, Omar, was taken from him when they were apprehended in June under the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which led to nearly 3,000 children being separated from their families. Omar feared his father had given up on him during the five months he spent in a Southwest Key shelter in Brownsville, Texas, with dozens of kids.\n\nRamirez was reunited with Omar last month only to learn that his son had been hospitalized for depression and medicated for unclear reasons and suffered a broken arm while in government custody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a system that causes irreparable damage,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son says they would tell him that because he wasn\u2019t from here, he had no rights.\u201d\n\nExperts say the deep anxiety and distrust children suffer when they\u2019re institutionalized away from loved ones can cause long-lasting mental and physical health problems. It\u2019s dangerous for all but worse for younger children, those who stay more than a few days and those who are in larger facilities with less personal care.\n\n\u201cThis is not a perplexing scientific puzzle. This is a moral disaster,\u201d said Dr. Jack Shonkoff, who heads Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. \u201cThere has to be some way to communicate, in unequivocal terms, that we are inflicting punishments on innocent children that will have lifelong consequences. No matter how a person feels about immigration policy, very few people hate children \u2014 and yet we are passively allowing bad things to happen to them.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials said increased need has driven them to expand the number of beds available for migrant children from 6,500 last fall to 16,000 today. Mark Weber, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees ORR, said sheltering children in large facilities, while not preferable, is a better alternative than holding them for long periods at Border Patrol stations ill-suited to care for them.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing program with incredibly dedicated people who are working to take care of these kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a large number of children and it\u2019s a difficult situation, and we are just working hard to make sure they are taken care of and placed responsibly.\u201d\n\nWeber confirmed a number of specific shelter populations from the data the AP obtained. To further verify the data, reporters contacted more than a dozen individual facilities that contract with ORR to house migrant children. Reporters also cross-referenced population numbers previously collected by AP and its partners.\n\nThe kids in government care range in age from toddlers to 17. The vast majority crossed the border without their parents, escaping violence and corruption in Central America, but some were separated from their families at the border earlier this year.\n\nThe care they receive varies greatly in the opaque network, which has encompassed 150 different programs over the last 20 months in 17 states. Some children live with foster families and are treated to Broadway shows, while others sleep in canvas tents exposed to the elements amid the Texas desert.\n\nThrough dozens of interviews and data analysis, AP found:\n\n\u2014 As of Dec. 17, some 9,800 children were in facilities housing more than 100 kids; 5,405 of those were in three facilities with more than 1,000 youths \u2014 two in Texas and one in Florida.\n\n\u2014 Texas had the most growth over the last 20 months in the number of kids under ORR custody. In April 2017, there were 1,368 migrant children in facilities or foster care in Texas. As of Dec. 17, the number was about 8,700.\n\n\u2014 New York had the second-highest number of children: 1,653, up from 210 in April 2017. Cayuga Centers grew from about 40 kids to close to 900; all are in foster homes.\n\n\u2014 The five largest providers, in order, are Austin, Texas-based Southwest Key; San Antonio-based BCFS Health and Human Services; Comprehensive Health Services Inc., based in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Cayuga Centers in Auburn, New York; and Chicago-based Heartland Alliance. Together they had about 11,600 children \u2014 or more than 80 percent of the 14,314 migrant youth in ORR custody as of Dec. 17.\n\n\u2014 The states with children in care are: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington state.\n\nKids continue to enter the system, though dozens of the care providers have been sued or disciplined before for mistreating children in their care. Now new litigation is piling up as attorneys fight to get migrant children released.\n\nStaff members at a Southwest Key shelter in Phoenix allegedly physically abused three children this year, leading to the closure of the shelter in October, federal officials said. And a lawsuit filed earlier this year alleged that Latino youths at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center in Virginia were beaten while handcuffed and locked up for long periods in solitary confinement, left nude and shivering in concrete cells.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and many experts warn against institutionalizing children in large groups. Dr. Ryan Matlow, a Stanford clinical psychologist whose work addresses the impact of early life stress, said best practices minimize the number of children in any one shelter.\n\n\u201cChildren are being treated as cogs in a machine, and their individual backgrounds, interests and unique identities are devalued as they are lost amongst the masses. This experience then becomes internalized, with significant psychological consequences,\u201d said Matlow, who recently met with migrant children in custody. \u201cThere is no way in which a mass detention setting can replicate the experience and support that comes from family and community.\u201d\n\nThe number of migrant children caught by immigration officials and then turned over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement has dropped under Trump: there were 49,100 in fiscal year 2018 compared to a high of 59,170 in fiscal year 2016, when a surge of youth crossing the border prompted the Obama administration to open emergency shelters at military bases. The average length of stay has increased, however, from about 34 days in January 2016 to around 60 days , according to government reports. In October, the average length of stay reached 89 days, according to data HHS provided to members of Congress, who shared it with AP.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration added new screening requirements that made it harder for parents and other relatives to get approved to take custody of the migrant children \u2014 including the fingerprint policy. That information has been shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, resulting in the arrests of dozens of would-be sponsors.\n\nUnder this week\u2019s change, only a parent or individual directly responsible for a child will have to submit fingerprints.\n\nHHS spokesman Weber said some fingerprinting requirements were necessary to ensure children are released to a safe environment: \u201cGiven the multitude of bad actors around the children, you really have to be careful.\u201d\n\nThe ORR migrant children\u2019s program has already cost taxpayers more than $1.5 billion, according to federal grant disclosures. Another $1.1 billion has been requested as part of the 2019 budget.\n\nThe facilities housing these children range from bucolic to jail-like.\n\nIn a Baltimore suburb, Board of Child Care shelters about 50 migrant children amid 28-acres of cottages and grassy lawns; Rite of Passage in Arizona has about 100 kids sheltered at facilities that look like posh, private schools surrounded by trees and fields. Youth for Tomorrow, founded in Bristow, Virginia, by former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs to serve troubled teens, is housing about 110 migrant kids on its 215-acre campus with soccer fields and volleyball courts, music and art therapy.\n\nSuspected gang members can be sent to several high-security facilities. An attorney for a Guatemalan teen held in the Yolo County, California, juvenile detention center for 11 months said his client was locked in restraints when he acted out and stung with pepper spray. Attorney Travis Silva convinced a judge to release the boy in November to his mother in Ohio. He\u2019s now being treated for trauma and mental illness, said Silva, and shelter statistics show 14 other teens remain locked inside.\n\n\u201cHe was locked in a cell, allowed one hour a day outside,\u201d said Silva. \u201cAnd outdoor time was anxiety-provoking, because that\u2019s when there could be fights.\u201d\n\nAt Tornillo, Texas \u2014 the largest of all the facilities \u2014 some 2,745 teens are held in massive tents. Staff aren\u2019t allowed to touch them, except for fist bumps. They can\u2019t hug.\n\n\u201cThe programs vary wildly from place to place,\u201d said Shana Tabak, who directs the Atlanta office of the Tahirih Justice Center, which represents immigrant women and girls. \u201cThe federal government has taken a haphazard approach to caring for these human beings.\u201d\n\nRepublican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district includes Tornillo, demanded that the government reunite the children with their families and shut down the detention camp by the end of the year, when the contract expires.\n\n\u201cUnnecessarily holding children for prolonged periods of time is no deterrent to illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is a symptom of a broader problem, and that is that we\u2019re not doing enough to address root causes of migration. We are the United States. We are better than this.\u201d\n\nEvery kid comes with their own set of needs, many severe.\n\n\u201cWe mostly have housed teenagers, some with their babies, and some sibling pairs whose parents have been murdered,\u201d said Regina Moller, executive director of Noank Community Support Services in Groton, Connecticut. Noank can house up to 12 of the kids at a time and has been at or near capacity for weeks now.\n\nAbbott House in Irvington, New York, takes kids with medical needs such as diabetes, cerebral palsy, depression and anxiety.

But unless that is done, it can result in significant disabilities and even death.\n\nBefore Daniel Truglio was born, an ultrasound showed Daniel had a cleft lip and a cleft palate. That's when Dr. Albert Oh at Children's National Medical Center started planning Daniel's surgery. Oh says the ultrasound shows how severe a cleft is.\n\n\"You can also tell whether it's one-sided or both sided, and it also gives you a chance to look for other potential associated problems that these babies can have,\" Oh said.\n\nDaniel was also born with a small jaw -- a complication that can accompany a cleft palate or lip. Doctors created a hole from the front of his neck into his windpipe, so Daniel could breathe. The procedure is called a tracheostomy, or trach for short.\n\nNine in 10 children with a cleft lip or palate can die without surgery according to Dr. William McGee. McGee founded Operation Smile to repair cleft lips and palates more than 35 years ago.\n\n\"More people die from lack of access to surgery, than from malaria, AIDS and TB combined,\" McGee said.\n\nOperation Smile and similar charities teach repair techniques to doctors in developing countries. Also, McGee says Operation Smile is heavily involved in research.\n\n\"We know there's a genetic connection to it and we have now the largest collection of genetic specimens in the world,\" McGee said.\n\nThree siblings provided the clue for the gene that causes this condition. Dr. Yang Chai led the research at the University of Southern California. Dr. Chai explained his research in a Skype interview.\n\n\"Normally you would only see one child in the family of three or four children that develop this birth defect,\" Chai said.\n\nA genetic mutation accounts for only about a third of the cases so scientists are still searching for other causes.\n\nAs for Daniel, he had his cleft palate fixed in May 2017. He needs more surgeries to extend his jaw and fix his teeth. But there's a world of difference between the baby he was then, and the toddler he is today.\n\nRobilyn Truglio, Daniel's mother, reflects on these changes.\n\n\"He was getting sick a lot...frequent colds, and he got pneumonia a few times...and he needed a lot more care at that time. He needed a lot of suctioning through his trach, and with getting sick all the time, he was in the hospital a couple of times, but right now if he doesn't get sick, and if he does, it's resolved quickly.

That first voyage by humans to another world set the stage for the still grander Apollo 11 moon landing seven months later.\n\nThere was unprecedented and unfathomable risk to putting three men atop a monstrous new rocket for the first time and sending them all the way to the moon. The mission was whipped together in just four months in order to reach the moon by year's end, before the Soviet Union.\n\nThere was the Old Testament reading by commander Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders.\n\nLastly, there was the photo named \"Earthrise,\" showing our blue and white ball \u2014 humanity's home \u2014 rising above the bleak, gray lunar landscape and 240,000 miles (386 million kilometers) in the distance.\n\nHumans had never set eyes on the far side of the moon, or on our planet as a cosmic oasis, surrounded completely by the black void of space. A half-century later, only 24 U.S. astronauts who flew to the moon have witnessed these wondrous sights in person.\n\nThe Apollo 8 crew is still around: Borman and Lovell are 90, Anders is 85.\n\nTo Lovell, the journey had the thrill and romance of true exploration, and provided an uplifting cap for Americans to a painful, contentious year marked by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, nationwide riots and protests of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe mission's impact was perhaps best summed up in a four-word telegram received by Borman. \"Thanks, you saved 1968.\"\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine \u2014 who at age 43 missed Apollo \u2014 marvels over the gutsy decision in August that year to launch astronauts to the moon in four months' time. He's pushing for a return to the moon, but with real sustainability this next go-around.\n\n50-50 chances\n\nThe space agency flipped missions and decided that instead of orbiting Earth, Borman and his crew would fly to the moon to beat the Soviets and pave the way for the lunar landings to come. And that was despite on its previous test flight, the Saturn V rocket lost parts and engines failed.\n\n\"Even more worrisome than all of this,\" Bridenstine noted earlier this month, Apollo 8 would be in orbit around the moon on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. \"In other words, if there was a failure here, it would wreck Christmas not only for everybody in the United States, but for everybody in the world.\"\n\nAs that first moon shot neared, Borman's wife, Susan, demanded to know the crew's chances. A NASA director answered: 50-50.\n\nBorman wanted to get to the moon and get back fast. In his mind, a single lap around the moon would suffice. His bosses insisted on more.\n\n\"My main concern in this whole flight was to get there ahead of the Russians and get home. That was a significant achievement in my eyes,\" Borman explained at the Chicago launch of the book Rocket Men last spring.\n\nEveryone eventually agreed: Ten orbits it would be.\n\nLiftoff of the Saturn V occurred on the morning of Saturday, Dec. 21, 1968.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the spaceship successfully slipped into orbit around the moon. Before bedtime, the first envoys to another world took turns reading the first 10 verses from Genesis. It had been left to Borman, before the flight, to find \"something appropriate\" to say for what was expected to be the biggest broadcast audience to date.\n\n\"We all tried for quite a while to figure out something, and it all came up trite or foolish,\" Borman recalled. Finally, the wife of a friend of a friend came up with the idea of Genesis.\n\n\"In the beginning,\" Anders read, \"God created the heaven and the Earth ...\"\n\nBorman ended the broadcast with, \"And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you \u2014 all of you on the good Earth.\"\n\nOn Christmas morning, their spacecraft went around the moon for the final time. The engine firing needed to shoot them back to Earth occurred while the capsule was out of communication with Mission Control in Houston. Lovell broke the nervous silence as the ship reappeared: \"Please be informed there is a Santa Claus.\"\n\nBack in Houston, meanwhile, a limousine driver knocked on Marilyn Lovell's door and handed her a gift-wrapped mink stole with a card that read: \"To Marilyn, Merry Christmas from the man in the moon.\" Lovell bought the coat for his wife and arranged its fancy delivery before liftoff.\n\nSplashdown occurred in the pre-dawn darkness on Dec. 27, bringing the incredible six-day journey to a close. Time magazine named the three astronauts \"Men of the Year.\"\n\nEarthrise\n\nIt wasn't until after the astronauts were back that the significance of their Earth pictures sank in.\n\nAnders snapped the iconic Earthrise photo during the crew's fourth orbit of the moon, frantically switching from black-and-white to color film to capture the planet's exquisite, fragile beauty.\n\n\"Oh my God, look at that picture over there!\" Anders said. \"There's the Earth coming up. Wow, is that pretty!\"\n\nBefore the flight, no one had thought about photographing Earth, according to Anders. The astronauts were under orders to get pictures for potential lunar landing sites while orbiting 70 miles (112 kilometers) above the moon.\n\n\"We came to explore the moon and what we discovered was the Earth,\" Anders is fond of saying.\n\nHis Earthrise photo is a pillar of today's environmental movement. It remains a legacy of Apollo and humanity's achievement, said professor emeritus John Logsdon of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, forever underscoring the absence of political borders as seen from space.\n\nAnders wondered then \u2014 and now \u2014 \"This is not a very big place, why can't we get along?\"\n\nLovell remains awestruck by the fact he could hide all of Earth behind his thumb.\n\n\"Over 3 billion people, mountains, oceans, deserts, everything I ever knew was behind my thumb,\" he recalled at a recent anniversary celebration at Washington's National Cathedral.\n\nAstronaut-artist Nicole Stott said the golden anniversary provides an opportunity to reintroduce the world to Earthrise. She and three other former space travelers are holding a celebration Friday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, 50 years to the day Apollo 8 launched.\n\n\"That one image, I think, it just gives us the who and where we are in the universe so beautifully,\" she said.\n\nBy July 1969, Apollo 8 was overshadowed by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin moon landing. But without Apollo 8, noted George Washington's Logsdon, NASA likely would not have met President John F. Kennedy's deadline of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade.\n\nBorman and Anders never flew in space again, and Soviet cosmonauts never made it to the moon.\n\nLovell went on to command the ill-fated Apollo 13 \u2014 \"but that's another story.\" That flight was the most demanding, he said, \"But Apollo 8 was the one of exploration, the one of repeating the Lewis and Clark expedition ... finding the new Earth.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Facebook Defends Data Sharing After New Report on Partner Deals", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-defends-data-sharing-after-new-report-on-partner-deals/4707596.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook defended its data sharing practices Wednesday after a report revealing that certain partners of the social network had access to a range of personal information about users and their friends.\n\nThe New York Times late Tuesday reported that some 150 companies \u2014 including powerful partners like Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Spotify \u2014 could access detailed information about Facebook users, including data about their friends.\n\nThe report marked yet another potential embarrassment for Facebook, which has been roiled by a series of scandals on data protection and privacy and has been scrutinized over the hijacking of user data in the 2016 US election campaign.\n\nKonstantinos Papamiltiadis, Facebook's head of developer platforms and programs, said in a blog post early Wednesday that the Times report was about \"integration partners\" which enabled \"social experiences \u2014 like seeing recommendations from their Facebook friends \u2014 on other popular apps and websites.\"\n\nPapamiltiadis added that \"none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission,\" and maintained that the deals did not violate a 2012 privacy settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission.\n\nAccording to documents seen by the Times, Facebook allowed Microsoft's Bing search engine to see names of Facebook users' friends without consent and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read private messages.\"\n\nThe report said Amazon was able to obtain user names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends' posts.\n\nWhile some of the deals date back as far as 2010, the Times said they remained active as late as 2017 and some were still in effect this year.\n\n'We've been public'\n\nPapamiltiadis said however that \"we've been public about these features and partnerships over the years because we wanted people to actually use them.\"\n\n\"They were discussed, reviewed, and scrutinized by a wide variety of journalists and privacy advocates,\" he said.\n\nBut he said most of the features are now gone.\n\n\"Still, we recognize that we've needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\" he added.\n\nNetflix said in a statement the feature was used to make the streaming service \"more social\" by allowing users to make recommendations to friends, but that it stopped using it in 2015.\n\n\"At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,\" Netflix said in an emailed statement.\n\nSpotify offered a similar response, indicating the music service \"cannot read users' private Facebook inbox messages across any of our current integrations.\"\n\nThe Canadian bank RBC, also cited in the New York Times, said the deal with Facebook \"was limited to the development of a service that enabled clients to facilitate payment transactions to their Facebook friends,\" and that it was discontinued in 2015.\n\nFacebook has already been called before lawmakers in the US and elsewhere to defend its data policies since news broke this year on the misuse of personal data in 2016 by Cambridge Analytica, a British consultancy working on Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nA report prepared for US lawmakers revealed this week showed detailed information on how Russian entities manipulated Facebook and other social networks to support the Trump effort.\n\nSenator Brian Schatz said the latest revelations highlight a need for tougher controls on how tech companies handle user data.\n\n\"It has never been more clear,\" Schatz tweeted. \"We need a federal privacy law.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has expanded powers to block foreign purchases of U.S. firms.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley people have been optimistic for a long time,\u201d said Xiaohua Yang, professor of international business at the University of San Francisco. \u201cBut now, they have begun to worry \u2026 about the lack of Chinese investment coming to support Silicon Valley technology development.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are concerned that U.S. tech companies, as they pursue the Chinese market or seek Chinese investment, might hand over core technology to the Chinese government, a competitor and sometime adversary on the global stage. The tech industry waits, as what constitutes \u201ccritical technologies\u201d under FIRRMA is still being developed.\n\nFor U.S. entrepreneurs, the changing climate may mean they will become more cautious, said Kwong, who advises startups.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do business in China, if you're doing consumer products, I say, that's probably fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let's presume you're doing AI. You better find out exactly what you're doing. You can have AI in a coffee machine, and I don't think that's much to do with defense. If you're doing facial recognition that may be something that's going to have a major problem.\u201d\n\nRandolph said that the tech industry has long had an \u201copen market, open platform\u201d approach, with the idea that anyone can come and \u201cwe're moving innovation forward globally.\u201d\n\nBut if tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to escalate, experts say, the very openness of Silicon Valley may be a casualty \u2014 even if tech firms stand to benefit if China becomes more open for doing business."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Pet Cloning the Cutting Edge of Chinese Biotech", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4706898.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. has had its share of famous on-screen dogs, from Lassie to Benji.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.\n\nBehind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.\n\nThis is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.\n\nThe Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory at the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nChinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into \u201ca modern civilized\u201d world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.\n\nThe Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making \u201cmany untrue reports\u201d about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.\n\n\u201cThose reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,\u201d the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.\n\nHowever, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.\n\nPayment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said \u2014 barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees \u2014 or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there \u2014 are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nA former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.\n\n\u201cThe camp didn\u2019t pay any money, not a single cent,\u201d he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. \u201cEven for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.\u201d\n\nRushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\n\u201cAmerican companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 9, 2018, photo, Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp, holds up a phone showing a state television report about what Beijing calls \"vocational training centers\" for a photo in a restaurant in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Koksebek says that shortly before he was released from the camp in April, the camp's director strode into his class and told them they would soon be opening a new factory, and that detainees would be required to work and taught how to cook, sew, and repair cars.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.\n\nAbout two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.\n\nMen and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 6, 2018, photo, Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, the wife of a sheep herder, holds up a picture of her daughter, Rezila Nulale, and her graduation certificate, at an office of an advocacy group for ethnic Kazakhs born in China in Almaty, Kazakhstan on December 6, 2018. Kaliaskar says her daughter, a college graduate who had a job in advertising, was detained in an internment camp in China's far western region of Xinjiang and is now being forced to make clothes for no pay.\n\nAs China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a \u201cvocational skills education and training center\u201d in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.\n\n\u201cTerrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,\u201d the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this \u201cglobal issue.\u201d\n\nWu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be \u201cunproblematic,\u201d he said, adding that the center is government-operated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making our contribution to eradicating poverty,\u201d Wu told the AP over the phone.\n\nThe 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.\n\nTrainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn\u2019t come here,\u201d one Uighur student said. \u201cThe party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.\u201d\n\nThe segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida\u2019s main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a child stands near a large screen showing photos of Chinese President Xi Jinping near a carpark in Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nPolice told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a \u201cmilitary facility.\u201d Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an \u201capparel employment training base.\u201d\n\nPosters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as \u201cLearn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person\u201d and \u201cNo need to pay tuition, find a job easily.\u201d\n\nNathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida\u2019s case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.\n\n\u201cThere are watchtowers throughout,\u201d Ruser said. \u201cThere are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.\u201d\n\nThe AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.\n\nAt least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.\n\nSprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp\u2019s sewing factory floor.\n\nShawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear\u2019s marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she\u2019s surprised the workers are \u201cfriendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Monday, Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a guard tower and barbed wire fences are seen around a facility in the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region.\n\nBadger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island\u2019s Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it\u2019s impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.\n\nAll the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.\n\nBadger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.\n\n\u201cWe will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,\u201d he said.\n\nBadger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.\n\nIn recent years, Badger imported sportswear \u2014 jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more \u2014 from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.\n\nThe U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention \u201ctraining\u201d there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.\n\nNew Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.\n\n\u201cNot only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,\u201d said Smith. \u201cU.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rushan Abbas, 51, of Herndon, Va., holds a photo of her sister, Gulshan Abbas, Monday, Dec. 17, 2018, in Washington. Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among the many Uighurs detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\nThe detention camp system is part of China\u2019s increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.\n\nNot all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn\u2019t have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,\u201d said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.\n\nInterviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director\u2019s words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to open a factory, you\u2019re going to work,\u201d Koksebek recalled him as saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.\u201d\n\nThis fall, months after Koksebek\u2019s release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.\n\nIn October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that \u201csome trainees\u201d were nearly done with their \u201ccourses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,\u201d Zahir said.\n\nThe forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang\u2019s economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.\n\nA hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read \u201cHouse of Workers\u201d could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018, photo, residents pass by the entrance to the \"Hotan City apparel employment training base\" where Hetian Taida has a factory in Hotan in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nMany of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder\u2019s wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.\n\nThen last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn\u2019t answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.\n\nFour months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for \u201cpolitical training.\u201d The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter\u2019s clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.\n\nLast month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar\u2019s brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.\n\nKaliaskar learned her daughter wasn\u2019t being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn\u2019t leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she\u2019s well educated and had a job,\u201d said Kaliaskar. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this training?\u201d\n\nA former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.\n\nIf they ran from the factories, they were warned, they\u2019d be taken straight back to the camps for \u201cfurther education.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory in the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nFarmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing\u2019s past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.\n\n\u201cI never asked the government to find work for my husband,\u201d said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.\n\nShe has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she\u2019s not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek\u2019s husband used to earn.\n\nSince her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a factory, but it\u2019s an excuse for detention. They don\u2019t have freedom, there\u2019s no time for him to talk with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they found a job for him.

But in a campaign to defeat Islamic State in Syria, Obama ordered air strikes from September 2014 and then troops in the country the following year.\n\nIt was not immediately clear from Sanders\u2019 statement whether all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in the country would leave and if so, by when.\n\nSanders suggested that the United States would remain engaged to some degree.\n\n\u201cThe United States and our allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary, and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamist terrorists territory, funding, support,\u201d she said.\n\nOne U.S. official said Washington aimed to withdraw troops within 60 to 100 days and said the U.S. State Department was evacuating all its personnel in Syria within 24 hours.\n\nA second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. military was planning for a full withdrawal but said the timing could be quicker than 60-100 days.\n\nA decision to pull out completely would upend assumptions about a longer-term U.S. military presence in Syria, which senior U.S. officials have advocated to help ensure Islamic State cannot reemerge.\n\nTrump, generally wary of all U.S. military involvement abroad, has previously voiced a strong desire to bring troops home from Syria. His tweet on Wednesday showed he saw no further grounds for remaining, even as some senior Republican lawmakers fiercely disagreed.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, often a Trump ally but generally a foreign policy hawk, said a withdrawal would have \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for the United States in the region and throughout the world.\n\n\u201cAn American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS, Iran, Bashar al Assad of Syria, and Russia,\u201d Graham said in a statement, using the acronym ISIS for Islamic State.\n\nA British defense minister said he strongly disagreed with Trump that Islamic State had been defeated in Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would study a U.S. decision to pull its forces from Syria and would ensure its own security. In Russia, TASS news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria created prospects for a political settlement of the crisis there.\n\nSPECIAL FORCES\n\nMany of the remaining U.S. troops in Syria are special operations forces working closely with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as theSyrian Democratic Forces, or SDF.\n\nThe partnership with the SDF over the past several years has led to the defeat of Islamic State in Syria, but has also outraged NATO ally Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG forces in the alliance as an extension of a separatist militant group fighting inside Turkey.\n\nThe deliberations on U.S. troops come as Ankara threatens a new offensive in Syria. To date, U.S. forces in Syria have been seen as a stabilizing factor in the country and have somewhat restrained Turkey\u2019s actions against the SDF.\n\nA complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria would leave a sizeable U.S. military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq. Much of the U.S. campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.\n\nStill, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and State Department officials have long fretted about leaving Syria before a peace agreement can be reached to end the brutal civil war.\n\nIslamic State is also widely expected to revert to guerilla tactics once it no longer holds territory. A U.S. withdrawal could open Trump up to criticism if Islamic State reemerged.\n\nTrump has previously lambasted Obama for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq that preceded an unraveling of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of Islamic State\u2019s advance into the country in 2014.\n\nA pullout would allow other countries, like Iran, to increase their influence in Syria, experts said.\n\n\u201cIf we withdraw then who fills the vacuum, who is able to stabilize and that is the million dollar question,\u201d said Andrew Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think-tank. \u201cThe timing is hard to understand.\u201d\n\nLAST 1 PERCENT\n\nIslamic State declared its so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d in 2014 after seizing large swathes of Syria and Iraq. The hardline Islamist group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.\n\nAccording to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kilometers (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under Islamic State control. It had estimated revenues of nearly one billion dollars a year.\n\nBrett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, last week said the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in its self-styled \u201ccaliphate.\u201d It has no remaining territory in Iraq.\n\nHajin, the group\u2019s last major stronghold in Syria, is close to being seized by U.S.-backed SDF forces.\n\nAfter losing Hajin, Islamic State will control a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the area where U.S.-backed operations are focused. Militants also control some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.\n\nBut U.S. officials have warned that taking back the group\u2019s territory would not be the same as defeating it.\n\n\u201cEven as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative,\u201d McGurk told a State Department briefing on Dec. 11.\n\nU.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cautioned earlier in December that the United States had trained only about 20 percent of Syrian forces required to stabilize areas captured from Islamic State."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Happy Birthday, GOP Tax Law. More Workers Might Become Contractors Because Of You.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tax-law-workers-contractors_us_5c1a498ce4b0432554c650fb", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act a year ago this week. It includes an incentive for workers to take contractor jobs.\n\nThe GOP tax law passed last year could hasten a workplace trend away from direct employment and toward the use of independent contractors, an arrangement that may save businesses money but would shortchange everyday workers in unseen ways.\n\nThat\u2019s the takeaway from a new paper by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank that\u2019s been critical of the Republican tax overhaul. Researchers there say the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Donald Trump signed a year ago this week, gives workers an incentive to take contractor jobs that forgo basic labor protections and drive down wages in blue-collar fields like trucking and janitorial services.\n\nThe White House has argued that by cutting corporate taxes and making it easier for firms to write off expenses, the law encourages companies to make capital investments that will eventually boost wages. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has said it will take \u201dthree to five years\u201d for workers to see the full benefit, which he controversially claimed could amount to a $4,000-per-worker raise.\n\nBut some workers might ultimately be hurt by the law\u2019s tax break on what\u2019s known as pass-through income \u2015 income that tax filers report on their individual returns after they earn it through a partnership, S-corp or sole proprietorship. Such money used to be taxed at the same rate as normal wages earned through a traditional job. But now independent contractors \u2015 who are technically business owners \u2015 can deduct 20 percent of qualifying pass-through income, thereby cutting their effective tax rate.\n\nThose savings could make it easier for companies to sell workers on independent contractor arrangements, a possibility that concerns labor and tax experts.\n\n\u201cAs far as we can tell, lawmakers didn\u2019t even consider this outcome,\u201d said Chye-Ching Huang, director of federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, noting that no public hearings were held on the tax bill before it was passed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a tangible grip on it. But the fact that we\u2019ve seen this trend [of using independent contractors] already emerging ... it does make us think it\u2019s a reasonable concern that this will add fuel to a long-burning fire.\u201d\n\nHow much the contract workforce has grown in recent years is a matter of hot debate. Some experts have found that it has spread dramatically, while others believe the growth has been negligible. What most experts agree on, however, is that contract work comes with plenty of drawbacks that workers may not recognize.\n\nHUFFPOST READERS: Did you wind up as a contractor after having been an employee for most of your career? Tell us about it.\n\nAccording to the CBPP, more companies may be tempted to use the contractor model going forward \u2015 and more workers may be willing to accept the arrangement \u2015 since the tax break would allow companies to pay workers less while assuring them the same after-tax income.\n\nThe paper did not estimate how many workers might move from being employees to contractors, since the tax law is still young and any projection would be speculation.\n\nAs far as we can tell, lawmakers didn\u2019t even consider this outcome. Chye-Ching Huang, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n\nSo if a worker\u2019s after-tax income is the same, then what\u2019s the big deal if their employee status changes?\n\nIndependent contractors, such as Uber drivers, technically work for themselves, not the companies that benefit from their labor. That means they don\u2019t receive a lot of the basic workplace protections other workers take for granted, like a minimum wage, time-and-a-half for overtime or the clear right to join a union. They are less likely to receive standard benefits like health care coverage or a 401(k) plan.\n\nAnd unlike traditional employees, contractors are responsible for paying both sides of the payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare \u2015 the employer\u2019s end as well as the worker\u2019s. They often bear other costs as well, as in the case of Uber drivers, who have to supply their own car and pay for their own gas. Many workers don\u2019t understand all the downsides when they agree to work under contract.\n\nBut there are plenty of benefits to the arrangement for employers. By keeping formal employees off their books, they not only avoid payroll taxes but can reduce costs related to unemployment insurance and workers\u2019 compensation. Contractor agreements can also help companies looking to avoid union organizing drives, since federal collective bargaining law doesn\u2019t cover independent contractors.\n\nThose advantages for corporations explain why many have chosen to use contractors instead of traditional workers. The author and academic David Weil, a labor official in the Barack Obama administration, coined a term for the phenomenon: the \u201cfissured workplace.\u201d Weil and other researchers have documented how the use of contractors to save costs has blurred the lines of corporate accountability, often leading to lower wages and higher injury rates for rank-and-file workers.\n\nModern home delivery offers a perfect example of the trend. As a 2014 HuffPost story detailed, many of the drivers delivering Amazon packages work as independent contractors tied to little-known courier companies like Lasership. Many of the workers have to buy their own vans in order to do their deliveries, and they can lose their routes or see their take-home pay cut at the whims of the company. \u201cIt\u2019s like they want us to be employees, but they don\u2019t want to pay for it,\u201d one driver explained.\n\nDean Baker, an economist at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said he agrees with the CBPP hypothesis that the enticements baked into the tax law will probably lead to more contracting.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, you give incentives for people to be independent contractors rather than employees, you will see more people be independent contractors,\u201d Baker said via email. \u201cI don\u2019t have a good sense of how many will go this route, but it is classic bad tax policy. You don\u2019t want to encourage people to change their employment relationship just to save on their taxes.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of the tax law probably aren\u2019t great enough to urge workers to become independent contractors, but it might make them more willing to tolerate its drawbacks, said Fran\u00e7oise Carr\u00e9, research director at the Center for Social Policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Carr\u00e9 has studied the use of independent contractors and believes employers already have plenty of reasons to use the model.\n\nThe new pass-through provision \u201cwould only be one of the factors,\u201d Carr\u00e9 said, and perhaps a limited one.\n\nYou give incentives for people to be independent contractors rather than employees, you will see more people be independent contractors. Dean Baker, economist\n\nThe new tax law includes a number of \u201cguardrails\u201d aimed at preventing workers from becoming independent contractors just to nab the new savings on pass-through income. The IRS proposed regulations in August designed to stop companies from classifying former employees as contractors, for example.\n\nNicole Hager, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee, which drafted much of the law, said lawmakers did anticipate the potential for abuse.\n\n\u201cTax reform included safeguards to prevent people from gaming the system by re-characterizing personal income as business income in order to use the pass-through deduction,\u201d Hager said.\n\nBrendan Duke, a tax analyst at the CBPP, said the guardrails probably won\u2019t be enough to prevent former employees from becoming contractors when workers move to different jobs over time. Another rule forbids people in certain industries from claiming the deduction if they make over $157,500. But most workers earn well below that so wouldn\u2019t be affected by the regulation.\n\nDuke said in most cases all the old incentives to using contractors still apply. Now it\u2019s just an easier case for employers to make to workers."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Fertility Tracking Can Be An Emotional Whirlwind For Women Trying To Get Pregnant", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-fertility-tracking_us_5c12a0cae4b0204682b7464d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Have you ever used a health app to track your personal data, such as diet, exercise or menstrual cycle? Did seeing the data make you feel excited and empowered? Or stressed and frustrated?\n\nWith the popularity of self-tracking technologies like apps and wearables, many people are becoming more engaged with their health data. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 69 percent of U.S. adults use tracking to manage their health or that of a loved one.\n\nMy colleagues and I are currently investigating a complex and emotional type of self-tracking: fertility. We specifically focus on how women use self-tracking technologies to assist their efforts to conceive. Fertility challenges are not uncommon: 7.5 million U.S. women experience fertility issues. Many of these women use fertility apps, but it\u2019s not yet clear how these tools can potentially impact their lives.\n\nOur research shows that women face multiple challenges when self-tracking for fertility, and they respond to the data in different ways. Some may find the experience positive, while others feel overwhelmed or give up altogether.\n\nDifferent types of engagement with data\n\nThe main goal of fertility self-tracking is to detect the ovulation day, because that defines each month\u2019s fertile period. However, there is no unique measure that can precisely identify ovulation, so women track multiple indicators \u2014 like temperature, physical symptoms or results from ovulation predictor kits \u2014 to estimate this period. Fertility apps aim to facilitate this data collection and reflection.\n\nWe chose to first analyze data from an online fertility forum, so we could focus on women\u2019s questions, challenges and concerns. We analyzed 400 threads with more than 1900 posts between 2006 and 2016. In our results, published in November, we categorize women\u2019s experiences with their data into five different types.\n\n1. Positive\n\nWomen who are positively engaged with their data see their data and feel excited with their results. They are often learning to track and understand their bodies, which leaves them feeling hopeful and confident. For example, one woman posted: \u201cDo you think I should test again tomorrow and the following 2 days? This is exciting!\u201d\n\n2. Burdened\n\nWomen in this group tend to increase the amount of data they track over time, so tracking becomes more burdensome. They express a higher level of stress and anxiety when compared to the first type. However, they still have a generally positive experience tracking and viewing data.\n\nFor example, one woman felt anxious because she could not follow her precise tracking schedule: \u201cI measure my temperature at 5:30 in the morning. The past 2 days I have been totally exhausted, and I over-slept. Yesterday, I did not measure my temperature until 6:30 and today I did it only at 6:50. Do you think I screwed up my temperature chart?\u201d\n\n3. Obsessive\n\nFor women in this group, tracking begins to occupy much of their attention. They tend to track even more data than the burdened type, often seeing any symptom as a possible measure to track. In this sense, they seem to be consumed with data, often over-tracking, and they express even higher levels of frustration and stress. However, they still believe in tracking and are unwilling to give up on it: \u201cI am searching for any little pain or irregularity to give me hope. You understand how it works!\u201d\n\n4. Trapped\n\nThis is the most emotionally intense type of engagement. Women with this relationship with data often have been trying to conceive for longer. They tend to express signs of despair, guilt and dependence. They want to stop tracking, but they feel unable to, like the woman who wrote: \u201cI want to stop trying so badly, but I just do not think I can forget about all this. I seriously do not believe I can refrain my brain from thinking \u2018today is the 10th day of my cycle, I should have sex, and so on.\u2019\u201d\n\n5. Abandoning\n\nIn some cases, tracking becomes so emotionally burdensome and the frustration with the negative results becomes so devastating that women decide to stop tracking and trying to conceive, either temporarily or permanently. As one woman wrote: \u201cBut after all the stress, constant worrying, tracking temperature, having intercourse on time, visits to doctors, blood tests and medications, I just decided I needed a break.\u201d\n\nA potential feedback loop\n\nFertility challenges are naturally emotional and stressful. These negative experiences are likely not generated by self-tracking alone.\n\nHowever, our research suggests that self-tracking may intensify these feelings. Some specific characteristics of fertility self-tracking may contribute to this.\n\nFirst, fertility is very personalized, as cycles vary from person to person. Also, the measures aren\u2019t straightforward; they can be subjective or hard to interpret, and they don\u2019t directly pinpoint ovulation. For example, ovulation predictor kits indicate ovulation will occur in the next 12 to 36 hours, while temperature rises the day after ovulation. Besides, the goal itself may even be unachievable \u2013 pregnancy may not occur through self-tracking or at all.\n\nIn this scenario, the act of tracking and the emotional experiences resulting from engaging with health data can create a feedback loop, progressing together and influencing each other. Women in the positive or burdened groups may experience some negative feelings, but their relationship with data is mostly positive. In these cases, self-tracking is reinforced by positive emotions, such as hope and feelings of agency.\n\nHowever, as our study showed, the other three types of engagement demonstrate a more problematic relationship with data. For women in the obsessive group, the measures and tracking activities dominate their emotional response. This is flipped for women in the trapped group: The emotional component is more intense and dominates their tracking activities.\n\nFinally, for women with an abandoning engagement, they reach a point where the relationship with data is so negative that it can become unsustainable.\n\nBetter tools\n\nThrough this work, we hope to contribute to the design of self-tracking technologies that support people in managing their health without negatively impacting their lives. Part of this lies in understanding individuals\u2019 emotions and behaviors when self-tracking.\n\nResearch like ours shows that the same tools and activities can generate almost opposite consequences for different people. This can be true beyond fertility. For example, diet and exercise apps can help people improve health behaviors, but may also contribute to problematic experiences for people with eating disorders.\n\nThat suggests it\u2019s important to make individuals\u2019 different emotional experiences visible. This knowledge can help us develop tools that can better support these populations.\n\nFor example, people may need different types of support, depending on their engagement with health data. In the fertility case, if the engagement is more problematic, tools could suggest cycles with reduced tracking, offer stress management suggestions or maybe even suggest taking breaks. Apps could also highlight the variability of fertility, note the characteristics and problems of different measures, and avoid presenting pregnancy as the only possible success.\n\nIf anything, our study reinforces that data are not neutral: They can have strong moral and emotional implications, especially in such sensitive contexts. As more people track their daily activities, designers need to consider how information they provide can affect users\u2019 emotion and well-being.\n\nMayara Costa Figueiredo is a Ph.D candidate in informatics and Yunan Chen is an associate professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Selena Gomez Emerges 2 Months After Seeking Treatment For Breakdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/selena-gomez-remerges-3-months-after-seeking-treatment-for-breakdown_us_5c1a6d19e4b01059bfc61c1e", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Selena Gomez arrives at the premiere of Hotel Transylvania 3 in July.\n\nSelena Gomez has re-emerged into public life more than two months after reportedly seeking treatment for an emotional breakdown.\n\nThe first pictures of the \u201cWolves\u201d singer have made the internet rounds with Gomez apparently enjoying a ski vacation with close friends in Big Bear, California.\n\nActress Bailee Madison and Connar Franklin posted a series of photos to Instagram of the 26-year-old looking happy, healthy and wearing a Reputation sweatshirt from bestie Taylor Swift\u2019s recent tour.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s feeling much better and looking forward to getting back to normalcy,\u201d an unnamed source told People about Gomez. \u201cShe\u2019s spending time with friends and family.\u201d\n\nAfter undergoing a kidney transplant in 2017 amid her ongoing battle with Lupus, Gomez was hospitalized twice due to a low white blood cell count.\n\nHealth issues \u201cthrew Selena into a downward emotional spiral,\u201d according to TMZ at the time, and resulted in a panic attack during her hospital stay.

After thinking they\u2019d have to go through the long and expensive process of in vitro fertilization, their infertility problem was attributed to a seminal blockage in Erik\u2019s testicles, which could be cleared with a simple procedure that would be covered by insurance.\n\nAnd if the issue was fixed, it could give them a chance to conceive naturally.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a weight off because [the urologist] seemed really optimistic,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cWe were really excited.\u201d\n\nBut after his outpatient procedure, Erik started experiencing severe abdominal pain. He later became constipated, and after two weeks, the pain was so intense that he wondered if he was about to die.\n\nListen to Episode 9 of \u2018IVFML Becoming Family\u2019 below.\n\nThat\u2019s why Melissa was in shock as Erik\u2019s health kept deteriorating. First, he was diagnosed with a perforated bowel caused by the surgery, which had allowed fecal matter to leak into his abdomen for weeks. The toxins caused an infection to set in. That triggered sepsis, which is when the body over-responds to a threat, putting organs at risk of failure.\n\nOnce Erik was stabilized, doctors performed surgery to reroute his intestine to a colostomy bag attached to the outside of his abdomen. The colostomy bag would collect his waste for a year to allow his large intestine to heal from the perforation.\n\nAll of Erik\u2019s complications weighed heavily on Melissa and filled her with immense guilt.\n\n\u201cI just start bawling because I\u2019m thinking, okay my husband just did this procedure, mostly because I want to have children,\u201d Melissa recalled. \u201cAnd with everything he\u2019s already been through, now he\u2019s going to be in surgery that he may not come out of.\u201d\n\nErik did come out of his surgery, and after a year, his colostomy reversal surgery was a success.\n\nImmediately after his surgery, it was difficult for the couple to imagine trying any other medical interventions to try to conceive. Still, after time passed, Erik consented to more treatment. This time it was IVF, and it was Melissa who had to deal with all the appointments and procedures.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful cycles, they finally made the decision to stop trying.\n\nThe Isolating Pain Of Involuntary Childlessness\n\nWhile experiencing infertility itself doesn\u2019t have long-term psychological consequences, involuntary childlessness does, said infertility sociologist Larry Greil of Alfred University.\n\n\u201cThe people who are distressed tend to be the people who wanted children but never had them,\u201d said Greil, explaining his 2003 study on the issue.\n\nWhether it be through adoption, giving birth or some other means, many infertile people do end up having children. But while there is research on infertile women who end up giving birth (Greil estimates it\u2019s \u201cwell below 50 percent\u201d), and research on infertile families who adopt children, there is no comprehensive estimate of how many infertile people become parents in the end.\n\n\u201cStrange as it may seem, no one has actually come up with a conclusive answer to the question: What percentage of infertile couples actually end up with a child?\u201d Greil said. \u201cMedia reports give the impression that everyone comes out with a baby, and that impression is false.\u201d\n\nErik and Melissa suspected that their story, which ended with the failure of infertility treatment, was more common than success stories. Yet they couldn\u2019t find any support from others who had gone through something similar. Instead, they encountered hostility from infertile people for deciding to stop treatment, and disbelief and a lack of support from some friends or family who wanted them to \u201cjust keep trying,\u201d despite Erik\u2019s near death experience.\n\n\u201cEven with what we\u2019ve been through, there\u2019s still people who have said, \u2018Don\u2019t quit \u2015 why are you quitting?\u2019\u201d Melissa said.\n\nTo create a support community for themselves and people like them, Erik and Melissa created a podcast called \u201cLiving Childfree With Erik And Melissa,\u201d and are hoping that other people in similar situations will reach out about their own experiences.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still sadness.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

Both men were warned in advance not to lie to investigators and one brought a lawyer to his F.B.I. interview.\n\nThe judge speedily dismissed that comparison, repeatedly noting that Mr. Flynn was a high-ranking government official who had betrayed the government\u2019s trust by lying \u201cin the White House, in the West Wing.\u201d\n\nAlthough Judge Sullivan has a reputation for being hard on government misconduct, he found no fault with the conduct of the F.B.I. or prosecutors. He said Mr. Flynn deceived not only F.B.I. agents, but also senior White House officials, who then repeated his lies to the American public.\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious offense,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case is in a category by itself.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he asked Brandon L. Van Grack, the lead prosecutor, whether Mr. Flynn was guilty of treason. The question clearly surprised a phalanx of lawyers on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team who were present for the proceedings. Mr. Van Grack at first hesitated to answer, then later said the government had no evidence of treason, and the judge dropped the point.\n\nSome of Judge Sullivan\u2019s sharpest rebukes involved Mr. Flynn\u2019s lies about his lobbying work for the Turkish government. Wrongly asserting that Mr. Flynn continued to work as an unregistered foreign agent during his short tenure as national security adviser, the judge gestured to the American flag at his side and declared: \u201cI mean, arguably, that undermines everything this flag over here stands for.
