It's kind of a rock star kind of a status,\" said retired Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks, a CNN military analyst, on Thursday.\n\n\"I think it's kind of a misplaced opportunity; the President really just needs to kind of marinate in the moment of being with these incredible soldiers who are protecting our freedoms, and that's what it's really all about,\" he added.\n\nTrump's visit came at a fraught moment for the President and the military. Trump's defense secretary resigned last week after the Syria troop decision, writing in a departure letter that the President deserved a military chief more aligned with his worldview. His replacement, a former Boeing executive, has scant foreign policy or military experience.\n\nTrump had faced scrutiny for putting off a visit to the troops. Privately, he wondered whether such a trip would only serve to highlight wars he does not support and wants to end. But in November, after facing criticism for canceling a visit to a military cemetery in France because of rain, Trump announced he would soon travel to a war zone.\n\nMAGA hat controversy\n\nOne US military official and the White House maintained Thursday that the campaign gear signed by Trump had been brought to the event by the troops, a distinction they argued indicates that the items were personal, rather than political in nature.\n\nAsked if the White House had distributed the hats, which appeared to be brand-new, to troops in Iraq and those who met with Trump during a refueling stop at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, press secretary Sarah Sanders told CNN they were personal items brought by the service members.\n\nThe optics of Trump signing items commonly found at his campaign rallies have continued to raise concerns among those who believe that his behavior was not only inappropriate, but also sent the wrong message to service members and the American public.\n\n\"Trump has blurred the line between the office of the presidency and the campaign to such a degree that it is making it much more difficult for troops to make that distinction on their own,\" according to CNN military analyst John Kirby, a former Pentagon spokesman.\n\n\"I hope that in the wake of the images that came out, military leaders there and here in DC are taking a look at the protocols and procedures ... of briefing service members before these types of visits ... particularly by this President,\" he said. \"It's bad enough that Trump doesn't see a problem with signing campaign paraphernalia at a military base, maybe even more so that some of our troops are OK with it.\"\n\nA US military official said Thursday that troops did not violate military policy by bringing signs and hats to the events, telling CNN the MAGA hats signed by Trump at the Ramstein event were personal items brought there by military personnel in hopes of getting autographs.\n\nThe official also contended that Trump's meeting with service members was not a campaign event, that there is no campaign currently underway and that the hats were used as support for Trump, not as a statement of political support.\n\nResponding to questions about the Ramstein event Thursday, Air Force spokesperson Capt. Christopher Bowyer-Meeder said the service has not been notified of any policy violations at this time and pointed out that there is no rule against airmen bringing personal items to be signed by the President.\n\nPoliticizing the military\n\nThat explanation did little to temper criticism from some lawmakers about what they viewed as an effort by Trump to manipulate the military for political purposes.\n\n\"President Trump must not take actions to politicize the US military or military service members,\" said Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the incoming chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"The President has a history of crossing that line. It is wrong to put service members in such a position and it severely undermines our democratic principles,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Kirby, Trump's actions during the trip to Iraq stem from his misguided understanding of the relationship between a commander in chief and the military.\n\n\"He conflates the obedience of the troops with political alignment and does not realize they are not political supporters of him, they are subordinates,\" he said.\n\nKirby said he believes the vast majority of troops understand that they are expected to leave their politics at the water's edge, but he acknowledged that some service members likely walked away from Wednesday's event seeing nothing wrong with the way Trump behaved despite strict guidelines intended to protect the military from the perception that it endorses a particular political candidate.\n\n\"One big danger is imbuing in the American people's mind that the military's loyalty is not to them, but to Donald Trump,\" he said. \"When Trump behaves this way, it conveys a message to the American people that the military is not there for them, it's there for him.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "How Trump's secret trip to Iraq became not-so-secret", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Qj-BNuu_11I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It was a crisp winter morning in Sheffield, England, when amateur photographer and plane enthusiast Alan Meloy looked out his kitchen window and noticed a large trail in the sky. He didn't know he was about to accidentally help uncover a highly sensitive, secret presidential trip to a conflict zone.\n\nAbout six hours before Meloy's discovery, President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were quietly whisked out of the White House under the cover of darkness on Christmas night for a trip to Iraq\n\n\"I literally stepped out, and I could see a trail coming towards me and thought let's have a look at what's on the end of that. And then I looked through the viewfinder and thought this is worth photographing, it's not just a normal airliner,\" Meloy told CNN.\n\nIt was that moment that the almost-retired IT project manager, who has been spotting planes for 40 years and enjoys keeping an eye on the skies, knew he was looking at something unique when he saw a distinct color scheme on the plane.\n\n\"I was absolutely amazed when that came past...I knew it was one of the two VC-25s,\" Meloy told CNN. \"I had no idea who was on it, in my mind I was thinking it must be someone pretty important.\"\n\nThe VC-25 is a modified Boeing 747-200 used to fly the President of the United States. Only two exist in the world and alternate as \"Air Force One.\"\n\nThe plane, which normally flies under the callsign \"AF1,\" had already sparked the interest of online aviation enthusiasts like \" CivMilAir ,\" a popular plane tracking enthusiast based in the UK, when it showed up on the map under the callsign \"RCH358\" or \"Reach 358.\" \"Reach\" is used by the military to designate cargo planes. The plane maintained an altitude of about 31,000 feet as it flew across the UK, according to flight logs.\n\nIt wasn't until Meloy snapped the picture of the plane that showed \"Reach 358\" was in fact \"Air Force One\" flying in disguise, except to the naked eye. He went online to post the picture to his Flickr account and see if anyone else had noticed the aircraft. While some online were intrigued and watching RCH358 others were skeptical, telling Meloy \"no it's not Air Force One, it's got a different callsign!\" he says.\n\n\"So all I said was I know what I've seen, it's a VC-25 there's only two of those in the world -- that's all I can tell you. There's my photograph.\" Meloy says he didn't want to start any speculation.\n\nThe photo picked up steam online and Twitter was soon on fire with speculation that Trump was heading to Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\nA few hours after Meloy spotted the plane through his Canon 7D from around 25 miles away, \"Reach 358\" secretly landed at Al Asad Airbase just west of Baghdad before the President and first lady met with troops for nearly three hours. Even Trump remarked at the steps of secrecy taken to ensure the safety.\n\n\"If you had seen what we had to go through with the darkened plane, with all windows closed, with no lights on whatsoever anywhere. Pitch black. I have never seen anything like it,\" Trump said while speaking to reporters on base in Iraq. The trip had been in the works for \"three to four weeks\" Trump said.\n\nFormer Secret Service Agent Jonathan Wackrow, who has helped coordinate conflict zone trips for multiple protectees, including a trip of then-President Barack Obama to Afghanistan, says the spotting of Air Force One and Twitter chatter is not a security breach, but is concerning and a lesson to be learned.\n\n\"In the age of social media, this highlights a new vulnerability that the Secret Service and military have to be super mindful of in the future,\" Wackrow says. \"You're charting new territory with the inclusion of social media from a threat perspective and from an awareness perspective, and future planning is going to address that.\"\n\nOn Christmas Day, the normal 13-person press pool was assembled quietly and sworn to secrecy -- a long-held tradition and agreement between the White House and Washington bureau chiefs that reporters won't report on secret overseas trips until the White House deems it safe to report, either once the trip is almost complete or the President is wheels up back to the United States.\n\nAs the buzz picked up on Twitter and it was becoming more apparent that Trump was heading to the Middle East, the secret embargo was lifted, and reporters struggling to get internet connections were finally allowed to file, confirming many 'avgeeks' suspicions of a secret presidential trip."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: Why troops in Iraq won't buy Trump's nonsense", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/AemU4yiX69Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Patrick Mondaca is an adjunct instructor at John Jay School of Criminal Justice in New York.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) \"If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!\" President Donald Trump tweeted recently.\n\nLet the military fix it -- that's the all-purpose solution, right? Wars to fight? Borders to defend? Americans to win over ahead of midterm elections ? Trump's got a panacea.\n\nThe President seems to love the troops, unless, of course, it's raining or there's a draft and he is required to serve. In both of those cases, well, the President was unwilling to inconvenience himself for the military. He is, quite literally, a fair-weather friend, engaging with the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our nation only when it benefits him.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Trump had yet to visit the troops in a combat zone out of concern for \"personal safety and legitimizing unpopular wars.\" It was reported Wednesday, however, that he stopped in Iraq for a post-Christmas visit and photo op with service members, during which he called the troops \"warriors\" and \"patriots\" who are getting \"billions and billions of dollars of new equipment that (Trump) approved over the last two years.\"\n\nThis may appear on the surface to be a genuine effort to honor the military, but those who serve, as well as the rest of us, should not be fooled by the President's empty actions. Nor will we be.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of his visit, the President has been called out for making the false claim that he had given the troops their first pay raise in over a decade . No one deserves to be lied to by the President, but for the commander in chief to make false statements to the faces of those who defend the nation shows a disappointing level of disrespect.\n\nWhen I served in Baghdad in 2003 with the US Army, my fellow soldiers and I were nonplussed listening to then-President Bush's \" Mission Accomplished \" speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure that many among the troops who trotted out for Trump's visit felt similarly. As we knew then and now, Bush's mission in Iraq was not quite accomplished, making his words seem hollow. And as our military today under Trump's leadership can also ascertain, dropping in for a few photos and some questionably sincere words does not a worthy commander in chief make.\n\nIn Flanders at the Battle of Boxtel in 1794, a mortally wounded Private Tommy Atkins told his superior officer as he lay dying in the mud, \"It's all right, sir, all in a day's work.\"\n\nRudyard Kipling immortalized the young soldier in his poem \" Tommy ,\" which says, in part:\n\n\"For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' 'Chuck him out the brute!'\n\nBut it's 'Saviour of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot\n\nAn' it's Tommy this an' Tommy that, an' anything you please\n\nAn' Tommy ain't a bloomin' fool -- you bet that Tommy sees.\"\n\nKipling's poem tells the stark truth of how many Americans feel about those who wear the uniform of the soldier, whether they choose to or not. We love them when we need them -- when we are threatened, when we are afraid, when we want them to potentially sacrifice life and limb for our country. But how quickly in peacetime we forget the magnitude of that sacrifice.\n\nOur own \"Tommies\" patrol throughout the world to this day, in Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria and Niger . They are stationed throughout our nation in transit hubs like Penn Station and John F. Kennedy International Airport. And now they are bivouacked uselessly on our southern border , awaiting their orders to pack it up and come home. They hover bored and watchful. Later they may die terribly and ungallantly in wretched places where the average American -- and the President -- would not dare to go. And we probably won't think about them again until we see notice of their death scroll briefly across the news ticker.\n\nBut Tommy isn't likely paying much attention to the President's bloviating or his fair-weather allegiances. He won't have been listening to the President's lip service about \" tremendous courage \" during the Thanksgiving video conference from his Mar-a-Lago luxury resort last month with military members in Afghanistan.\n\nInstead, active Tommies are putting in a hard day's work. And retired Tommies are standing in line at the Veterans Affairs hospital to get prescriptions for depression, anxiety and sleep disorders.\n\nTommy is putting on his dress uniform and taking his own life with a rifle after dealing with the Department of Veterans Affairs' incompetence. He is one of the 20 veterans who kill themselves daily in this country, according to a 2018 Department of Veterans Affairs news release\n\nYes, Tommy volunteered for his or her military service, but he or she volunteered for the good of the country and not for the President's personal agenda.\n\nStay up to date...

Eventually, they gave up.\n\n\"When people are in their 20s and 30s, they can't really afford to live in a bigger space in a city,\" Katsunori said. \"We knew that if we wanted to have more kids, we couldn't do it there.\"\n\nCocooned amid hills, the little town of Nagi-cho is also home to a Japan Self Defense Forces garrison and the Nagi Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nFourteen years later, the Osakas moved to Nagi, where Katsunori grew up. The sleepy agricultural town in western Japan has become a success story in the country's efforts to boost its declining birth rate.\n\nWith a population of about 6,000, Nagi feels a world away from Nagoya, and residents cite the lack of busy streets and crowds as reasons why it is a great place to bring up children.\n\nBut they're not the only benefits: Nagi also pays couples who live there to have children.\n\nFamilies receive 100,000 yen ($879) for their first child, 150,000 yen ($1,335) for their second and as much as 400,000 yen ($3,518) for the fifth child born to the same family.\n\nNagi has been ramping up payments since 2004, as well as offering other fertility-boosting parental perks, to turbocharge the town's birth rate and buck Japan's broader trend of aging populations.\n\nPerks include subsidized housing, free vaccinations, school allowances and reduced nursery costs.\n\nAnd they appear to be working.\n\nIn the neighborhood where the Osakas live, most couples have three or more children because they can and they want to.\n\nThis leaves Nagi in stark contrast to much of Japan.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, the town's fertility rate -- based on the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime -- doubled from 1.4 to 2.8, to widespread domestic acclaim.\n\nSince then, Nagi's total fertility rate has dipped slightly to 2.39 but is still considerably higher than the national average of 1.46.\n\nThe Osakas say they'd like their children to experience the world first, instead of settling down immediately in Nagi-cho.\n\nShrinking Japan\n\nJapan has been on a steady demographic decline since the 1970s.\n\n1.3 million, In 2017, fewer than 950,000 babies were born while the number of deaths rose to a postwar high of1.3 million, according to the Ministry of Health and Labor.\n\nand children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. Japan's population is expected to drop to about The country's total population stands at 127 million,and children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. And by 2065 Japan's population is expected to drop to about 88 million\n\nMore than 5,400 children are seeking an elusive spot at day care centers in the city, nearly 30% of the national total.\n\nTraditionally, government policies had made it difficult for working men and women to balance their careers with family life, said Hirokazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nAs well as a lack of child care, the country's declining fertility rate is influenced by career demands and the increasing trend among men and women to delay or avoid marriage . The numbers of people still unmarried by age 50 hit a record 23.37% for men and 14.06% for women in 2015, according to a report released by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.\n\nBut Kato said another key factor is the steady migration of people from the countryside to expensive smaller apartments in crowded cities.\n\nMore than 93% of Japan's population lives in urban areas , where having one or more children is just too hard for many couples.\n\n\"There's a huge gap between the cost of living in Japan's major cities and the less populated areas of the country,\" Kato added. Couples in the city are often also far from their families, who could otherwise help support them.\n\nIt's not uncommon for families to have three to five children in Nagi. Kids play games with their siblings at the local preschool. For now, there is no waiting list to get a spot at day care.\n\nIs the progress enough?\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has introduced policies to boost its birth rate, such as enhancing child care services and improving housing and public facilities for families with children.\n\nLast year resulted in some progress nationally: The number of children on waiting lists for day care centers nationwide slipped below 20,000 for the first time in 10 years, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\nspending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at day care centers. Furthermore, that year, the government announced a 2 trillion yen ($18 billion)spending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at day care centers.\n\nAs in many places around the world, women in Japan were traditionally expected to leave work to care for their families. But such attitudes are slowly shifting.\n\n\"The traditional way of thinking, 'men at work and women at home', is a historical relic in Japan,\" said Yukiko Inoue-Smith, a professor of education psychology at the University of Guam. \"Women in Japan want to keep their jobs, and their husbands want them to work so they can have a double income.\"\n\nGovernment efforts to keep women in the workforce through a plan called womenomics are also paying off.\n\nIn just three decades, the percentage of Japanese women age 30 to 34 who return to the labor force after becoming mothers has risen from 50% to 75%, according to recent reports.\n\nBut many of those who go back to work have to accept lower wages or get stuck on the career ladder, according to a report published in 2017 by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nFathers must also play a greater role in child care and the home so women can resume their careers, according to Inoue-Smith.\n\nThis presents its own difficulties. In Japan, new fathers can take up to one year of non-paid paternity leave -- one of the highest fathers leave periods in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, only 3% take this, as they fear the repercussions on their careers and income.\n\nA family-friendly future\n\nNestled amid leafy hills, Nagi is famous for its wagyu beef and boasts a small manufacturing center where 19 companies have factories. Life remains fairly traditional; most couples marry in their early to mid-20s and start families soon after.\n\nThe women who live in or move to the town know it doesn't offer high-flying careers but value the chance to balance work and home life.\n\nUp to 70% of women continue their day jobs, often as office workers or teachers, after childbirth. Lengthy commutes, grueling workloads and limited child care aren't a problem here. And for mothers who want to work a few hours a week, a local company offers casual jobs such as data inputting and packaging goods while their children are in day care.\n\nNobue Sasaki stands in the hallway of the Nagi Child Home.\n\nThe town also spends a decent proportion of its budget on family services, partly due to extra funds it receives from the government for hosting a Japan Self-Defense Force garrison.\n\nIn the past, officials here have also accepted lower salaries so they can funnel more money into the town's future.\n\nSome large extended families still live under one roof, or at least within the same neighborhood, so grandparents can pitch in with the children while their parents work.\n\nNagi-cho strives to create a family-friendly setting for all age groups. Kozue Kobayashi relaxes with her child in the Nagi Child Home. An older volunteer watches over a busy mother's child.\n\n\"We've really focused on creating a family-friendly environment in Nagi,\" Nobue Sasaki, a soft-spoken town official, said inside the pastel-tinted walls of the Nagi Child Home, a center dedicated to supporting mothers and people across the age spectrum.\n\nKozue Kobayashi, a mother in her early 30s who moved from Okayama city to Nagi, said she appreciated the camaraderie of the Nagi Child Home, where she gets help looking after her children. She comes most days.\n\n\"It's better than just staying at home and feeling alone and overwhelmed,\" Kobayashi said. \"If I'd stayed in Okayama, I wouldn't have access to this kind of service.\"\n\nNagi undertook a large-scale public relations campaign in 2012 to publicize the success of its family planning initiatives -- and word has spread.\n\nWhen CNN visited, a group of smartly dressed senior bureaucrats milled around the entrance to the center's playroom. They were just some of the many people who had come to learn the town's fertility secrets.\n\n\"Our population has remained stable, but we can take some lessons away from a space like this,\" said Nagatoshi Ishiura, a bespectacled local politician from the neighboring town of Shouji. \"It's nice to see a place where there's still exchange between three different generations.\"\n\nThe Osakas' daughter prepares to play against her brother.

India still holds that distinction, but growth pulled back sharply to 7.1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nGDP data for the final quarter of 2018 is expected in February and could factor into Modi's appeal to voters as he seeks a second term as prime minister.\n\nVoters will also pay attention to Modi's efforts to promote job creation. Around 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, but many struggle to find employment. India does not publish official employment data, but a recent study by researchers at Azim Premji University concluded that an \"increase in unemployment is clearly visible all across India.\"\n\nRupee trouble\n\nThe Indian rupee hit a series of record lows in 2018 and ranks as one of Asia's worst-performing currencies. Despite a slight recovery as the year draws to a close, it is still down around 10% against the US dollar in 2018.\n\nThe currency will weaken further next year because of political uncertainty around the election and concerns about the independence of India's central bank, analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a recent note.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTurmoil at the top bank\n\nThe darkest cloud on India's economic horizon concerns its central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nFormer central bank chief Urjit Patel stepped down abruptly in early December \u2014 nine months before his term was due to end. While Patel said he quit for personal reasons, his departure was preceded by a public spat between the central bank and Modi's government.\n\nThe government was reportedly pressuring the bank to do more to boost growth ahead of the election, and analysts told CNN that Patel was probably \"no longer able to withstand\" that pressure.\n\nModi wasted no time in replacing Patel, appointing Shaktikanta Das, a former government finance official, as his successor barely 24 hours later.\n\nDas' hasty call-up and his government track record have sparked concerns that the central bank's autonomy could be compromised.\n\nHis appointment \"is likely to keep investors and markets worried about RBI's independence, given his close ties with the government,\" said Priyanka Kishore, senior India economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nKishore and other analysts predict the central bank, which hiked interest rates twice in 2018 and has held them steady since, will slash them in 2019.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMany of Modi's proposed reforms, particularly to India's land acquisition and labor laws, have not yet materialized.\n\nThe major overhauls he has enacted, such as changes to the tax system and the cash ban, have been hugely disruptive to the economy.\n\nNext year's elections could paint a different picture.\n\n\"An election victory for Prime Minister Modi could provide space to re-energize his reform agenda after a lackluster 2018,\" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.\n\nModi could seek to cut red tape for business and further open India to foreign investment, Shah said. Another push to privatize state-owned firms is also likely.\n\nOther traditional pressures on the Indian economy, such as high oil prices, have eased in recent months. But as one of the world's biggest energy importers, another spike could hit India hard.\n\nWhatever happens at the polls will have major implications for India's economic health.\n\n\"The election is likely to prove a turning point for the economy,\" Shah said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Explosion lights up New York sky in shades of blue", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/4oiRy8C4dyc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) An electrical flash at a Con Edison substation in Queens temporarily lit up New York's skyline Thursday night in a brilliant blue.\n\nDespite the eerily glowing color, there was no alien invasion.\n\nInstead, the light came as part of an electrical fault that caused an \"arc flash,\" Con Edison spokesman Bob McGee said Friday morning, similar to lightning.

And then he was gone. Although I generally hate posting pictures of people online without getting their approval, I decided to share the image on Twitter since his face wasn't in it -- and because the message was so important.\n\nHere is a photo I took at my Target yesterday and can't stop thinking about. pic.twitter.com/gbzF47AqCy\n\nWithin a few hours, my picture of this man -- whom I've since identified as Raymond Thompson -- had gone viral. Celebrities such as Zach Braff, Martina Navratilova and Evan Rachel Wood shared it. Actress Sarah Hyland, who recently revealed she had a second kidney transplant , shared the image, too.\n\nNearly a week later, the photo was past 23,000 retweets and 35,000 likes.\n\nThompson, who lives in Brooklyn with his wife Mylen and their 4-year old daughter, Rachel, doesn't even have a Twitter account. But he knew something was going on when his phone began lighting up with calls and texts from unfamiliar numbers all over the world. Strangers were offering to give Mylen a kidney.\n\nWhen I called Raymond, he recognized my name because others had sent him screenshots of my tweet.\n\nMylen met her future husband in an AOL chat room in 2000 and they bonded over their love of pro wrestling. She was diagnosed with kidney disease two years ago.\n\n\"She called me at work and said, 'Babe, you need to come home right now.' She said, 'I can't feel my right side. It's numb,' \" Raymond told me. Now \"she goes to a [dialysis] center for three hours, three days a week. There's a machine that filters your blood. It takes a lot out of you.\"\n\nMylen and Raymond's family members got tested, but none were a match. Raymond was inspired by the story of Rob Leibowitz, who wore an \"In need of kidney\" T-shirt around Disney World -- a gambit that eventually worked\n\nOne thing Raymond wants to clear up is that his family won't be setting up a GoFundMe for medical expenses -- between his work's insurance and Medicare, they're covered. It's just the kidney they need.\n\n\"I had a few people walk up to me and try to give me money,\" he said. \"I refuse that every single time.\"\n\nThe Thompsons recently decided to switch Mylen's care to NYU Langone Hospital , a move that could open the door to test the many people who have called -- some from as far away as Pakistan and Australia -- to see if they're a match.\n\nOne of those people was Becca Joyner, who saw the tweet when it was shared by actress Patti Murin, who plays Anna in Broadway's \"Frozen.\"\n\nJoyner, a county clerk who lives in Farmville, North Carolina, suffers from Crohn's disease and recently underwent surgery to remove part of her intestine.\n\n\n\n\"I have been in and out of the hospital more times than I can count on my hand,\" she said. \"I was terrified. Afterward I spent a week in the hospital, so I know what it's like. Something was just telling me to reach out and see if you can help in any way.\"\n\nRaymond plans to contact those who've reached out starting in January. But even if a viral Twitter picture results in Mylen getting a kidney and moving off of dialysis, the Thompsons don't believe their work will be done.\n\n\"Sickness doesn't care who you are,\" said Raymond. \"I appreciate everyone who reaches out. It means a lot to us to get the message out there.\n\n\"Sign up to be organ donors. There are so many people that actually need organs, especially kidneys. You have two and can live a healthy life with just one. Just sign up.\"\n\nIndeed, the wait can be long for those in need of a kidney transplant. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing.

But it also meant promises delivered for voters who prescribed his electric shock therapy and who relish the sight of political, legal and media establishments in Trump-induced meltdowns.\n\nAfter a year of domestic chaos, shocks from the Russia probe and belligerence abroad, Trump is less restrained and making more waves than ever.\n\n\"My whole life has been heat.

A new state law requires Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to appoint a new board, but not until January 31, 2019.\n\nIn a letter Friday to both state party chairs, Cooper said he will appoint a temporary five-member board under the old rules to preside until the end of January \"to hasten the investigatory work by the Board and maintain continuity.\"\n\nState Republicans have said Cooper does not have the authority to do so and plan to challenge that in court as well. The party has also said they will not accept appointments to the temporary board Cooper is trying to establish.\n\nThe state elections board had been expected to call for a new election in early 2019 if it was able to corroborate the evidence of irregularities in the 9th district race.\n\nOfficials are in the process of reviewing evidence of absentee ballot fraud allegedly orchestrated by Leslie McRae Dowless, whose efforts potentially helped Harris win Bladen County.\n\n\"To date, the State Board's investigative staff has conducted more than 100 interviews, and the staff is actively engaged in the review of more than 182,000 pages of materials produced in response to 12 subpoenas issued by the State Board,\" Joshua Malcolm, the Democratic chair of the board, said in an affidavit filed in court on December 21.\n\nHarris has denied any wrongdoing. In his interview with WBT radio, Harris defended his decision to hire Dowless, saying that the GOP operative was recommended to him by political leaders he trusted in the state.\n\nHarris claimed specifically that Dowless said he does not collect, or \"harvest,\" absentee ballots, which Dowless is accused of doing and is an illegal practice in North Carolina.\n\nHe also floated a conspiracy theory that the elections board, which is made up of both Republican and Democratic members, purposely held on to that information to prevent him from winning the election.\n\n\"Did they decide that they would sit on this and they would wait, and they would see and somehow if $11 million and Dan McCready couldn't beat Mark Harris, this would be an insurance policy that they would play to get a do-over?\" Harris asked. \"I would hate to think that we had an agency in our state government that would operate with that kind of sinister leadership, but I am telling you the facts are the facts, they sat on this and we could've known what was happening there, and I just think it is sad.\"\n\nThe state's Republican Party applauded the Harris' campaign's decision to file a petition in court.\n\n\"It is important to note that no serious evidence of some of the most concerning allegations including widespread destruction of ballots ever materialized,\" North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement Friday. \"There is simply no concrete evidence to show that even the mishandling of some absentee ballots amounted to a change of more than a thousand votes in this race.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "House Democrats scooping up staff, lawyers to power Trump investigations", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/qES6UbJrsoY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "A recent committee job posting reviewed by CNN asked for legislative counsels with a variety of expertise: \"criminal law, immigration law, constitutional law, intellectual property law, commercial and administrative law (including antitrust and bankruptcy), or oversight work.\"\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee needs lawyers, too, posting jobs for \"executive branch investigative counsel.\"\n\nThe advertisements give a window into the Democratic recruiting that's ramped up ahead of the party gaining subpoena power for the first time in eight years when it takes over the House in January.\n\nWhile Democrats publicly talk up their interest in focusing on legislative priorities like health care and voting rights -- not to mention ending the ongoing partial government shutdown -- they are quietly preparing for what will likely be the largest congressional investigation of a sitting president in recent memory. Party leaders and committee chairs have spent months ironing out potential targets, from President Donald Trump's taxes and business dealings to the conduct of current and former Cabinet members.\n\nTo handle all this investigative work, House Democrats are expected to double the number of their staffers. Though they can't officially hire anyone until the new Congress is seated, plans are well underway, with House members saying that candidates -- especially those with specific investigative skills, from money laundering to contracting -- are coming from all directions.\n\n\"They're finding us,\" said Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat who will be taking over the House Armed Services Committee, which will have a significant piece of foreign policy oversight. \"There are a lot of Democratic refugees out there after the Republicans took over the House, the Senate and the White House.\"\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who's a member of the Oversight Committee, said she ends up forwarding some of the resumes that come to her office to committee staffers in charge of hiring. \"They are people with law degrees and experience just wanting to be part of this historic moment,\" she said.\n\nThe hiring efforts started early. One Democratic House committee posted a help-wanted ad on a job board frequented by Capitol Hill staffers the day after the November 6 midterm elections. The post, which did not name the committee, sought \"investigative counsel to conduct congressional investigations and advise on policy matters related to oversight of the executive branch.\"\n\n\"Responsibilities include staffing letters and subpoenas, conducting interviews, organizing and staffing hearings and preparing memos, talking points, statements and reports as necessary,\" the listing stated. \"Previous congressional or executive branch experience preferred, but candidates with diverse backgrounds and experiences are encouraged to apply. Candidates must have attention to detail, excellent writing skills, excel under pressure and have a sense of humor.\"\n\nOne person familiar with the Democratic ramp-up in staffing told CNN, \"There are a lot of people willing to take pay cuts to come do that work.\"\n\n\"We're being deluged with resumes, really impressive resumes. There will be no shortage of good candidates. The difficulty will be choosing among them,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who will lead the House Intelligence Committee next year and will play a key role in investigating Russian election interference.\n\nSchiff has signaled that he also wants to focus on questions about possible money laundering and the Trump Organization. A source familiar with the Intelligence Committee's planning tells CNN that Schiff is looking to hire investigative staff with expertise in financial crimes.\n\nThat could overlap with work that Rep. Maxine Waters of California intends to pursue. Waters will lead the Financial Services Committee, and has been pressing for an investigation into potential money laundering, particularly involving Trump's loans with Deutsche Bank.\n\nCoordination\n\nTo ensure investigations don't devolve into a confusing mass of overlapping inquiries and turf wars, coordination will be key for likely incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Likely Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland has agreed to meet weekly with committee chairs to discuss priorities, according to a source familiar with the matter. Party leaders have also told incoming committee chairs to work out turf fights in private rather than hashing out who has jurisdiction over what in public.\n\nThat won't be easy. Many of the big stories and scandals don't fit neatly into one committee or another, and certain chairmen will have far more authority than others. That's particularly true with Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the incoming chair of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform committee, which has sweeping authority over the entire federal government.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Cummings downplayed the potential of any turf fights . \"We're not going to step on each other's toes,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that if there is jurisdiction that we work that out in private and then go to our committees and do what we have to do.\"\n\nAides warn that it will likely be months before the public sees the full scope of investigations.\n\n\"I think Democrats will be ready, but there is also going to be hundreds of thousands of documents requested and produced. It is going to be a little bit of drinking out of a fire hose in the beginning,\" one source familiar with planning told CNN.\n\nWhile there's been careful planning already underway about which investigations to pursue, new developments could alter the Democrats' strategy. After a second child died in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection this month , for instance, Pelosi announced that Democrats would be investigating the issue.\n\nProtecting Mueller\n\nFor Democrats emphasizing the need to focus on legislative rather than investigative priorities, there is one move that could arguably do both: passing legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAccording to one Democratic aide, a bill to protect the special counsel from interference is expected to be among the first items Democrats pursue. Such legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year but was never put to a vote on the floor. That bill will give House Democrats an avenue to pressure the GOP-led Senate to act, too, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has shown no interest in taking up the measure, even after outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona launched a blockade on confirming judges over the lack of a floor vote on the measure.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation has to be protected, absolutely,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat. \"There's a lot of consensus on our side that will be a key priority.\"\n\nThe Mueller probe provides an interesting test for Democratic chairmen and chairwomen. While it could do some of the work for them by providing new details, it will also tempt many of them to go after what he uncovers.\n\nThe sentencing of Michael Cohen, for instance -- in which federal prosecutors said Trump had directed Cohen to commit campaign finance crimes by paying women not to speak about alleged affairs -- makes him a potential witness before multiple committees.\n\nCummings said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" earlier this month that he wanted Cohen to testify in January, and that his committee could be the appropriate venue.\n\n\"Quite possibly,\" Cummings told CNN when asked whether his committee would investigate Cohen's crimes. \"We're still trying to figure out who's doing what. Because the last thing we want to do is stepping on each other's toes. Somebody's going to get into it.\"\n\nCohen has already testified before Schiff's committee, admitting in his November guilty plea that he had lied before the panel about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project. Schiff might want to haul Cohen back in to explain himself on that matter, though Schiff was already ceding the investigation of payments to women to Cummings the day after the story broke.\n\nTrump's taxes\n\nAt the center of Democrats' efforts is the pursuit of Trump's tax returns. While modern presidents have handed over their returns willingly, Democrats are prepared to force the issue, arguing Trump has defied precedent.\n\nRep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he intends to use an arcane IRS code that allows his committee to ask the Treasury Department for the President's returns.\n\nNeal -- a business-minded Democrat who has earned a reputation as a willing negotiator -- had hoped Trump would be willing to negotiate and turn over his tax returns without a fight. But in recent weeks, comments from Trump's allies have made it clear that asking nicely would be a waste of time. A source close to the process told CNN that Neal was prepared to make a formal request to the Treasury Department in the new Congress. When that would take place was still undecided.\n\n\"We're not doing this by a knee jerk,\" said Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey. \"We've got research up the gazoo behind us and the law's on our side.\"\n\nDepending on what's in them, Trump's tax returns could provide information that would feed investigations by other committees.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what our, what has been the sources of income for this President,\" Cummings said. \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia; we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns, where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "How Trump's secret trip to Iraq became not-so-secret", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Qj-BNuu_11I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It was a crisp winter morning in Sheffield, England, when amateur photographer and plane enthusiast Alan Meloy looked out his kitchen window and noticed a large trail in the sky. He didn't know he was about to accidentally help uncover a highly sensitive, secret presidential trip to a conflict zone.\n\nAbout six hours before Meloy's discovery, President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were quietly whisked out of the White House under the cover of darkness on Christmas night for a trip to Iraq\n\n\"I literally stepped out, and I could see a trail coming towards me and thought let's have a look at what's on the end of that.

Only two exist in the world and alternate as \"Air Force One.\"\n\nThe plane, which normally flies under the callsign \"AF1,\" had already sparked the interest of online aviation enthusiasts like \" CivMilAir ,\" a popular plane tracking enthusiast based in the UK, when it showed up on the map under the callsign \"RCH358\" or \"Reach 358.\" \"Reach\" is used by the military to designate cargo planes. The plane maintained an altitude of about 31,000 feet as it flew across the UK, according to flight logs.\n\nIt wasn't until Meloy snapped the picture of the plane that showed \"Reach 358\" was in fact \"Air Force One\" flying in disguise, except to the naked eye. He went online to post the picture to his Flickr account and see if anyone else had noticed the aircraft. While some online were intrigued and watching RCH358 others were skeptical, telling Meloy \"no it's not Air Force One, it's got a different callsign!\" he says.\n\n\"So all I said was I know what I've seen, it's a VC-25 there's only two of those in the world -- that's all I can tell you. There's my photograph.\" Meloy says he didn't want to start any speculation.\n\nThe photo picked up steam online and Twitter was soon on fire with speculation that Trump was heading to Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\nA few hours after Meloy spotted the plane through his Canon 7D from around 25 miles away, \"Reach 358\" secretly landed at Al Asad Airbase just west of Baghdad before the President and first lady met with troops for nearly three hours. Even Trump remarked at the steps of secrecy taken to ensure the safety.\n\n\"If you had seen what we had to go through with the darkened plane, with all windows closed, with no lights on whatsoever anywhere. Pitch black. I have never seen anything like it,\" Trump said while speaking to reporters on base in Iraq. The trip had been in the works for \"three to four weeks\" Trump said.\n\nFormer Secret Service Agent Jonathan Wackrow, who has helped coordinate conflict zone trips for multiple protectees, including a trip of then-President Barack Obama to Afghanistan, says the spotting of Air Force One and Twitter chatter is not a security breach, but is concerning and a lesson to be learned.\n\n\"In the age of social media, this highlights a new vulnerability that the Secret Service and military have to be super mindful of in the future,\" Wackrow says. \"You're charting new territory with the inclusion of social media from a threat perspective and from an awareness perspective, and future planning is going to address that.\"\n\nOn Christmas Day, the normal 13-person press pool was assembled quietly and sworn to secrecy -- a long-held tradition and agreement between the White House and Washington bureau chiefs that reporters won't report on secret overseas trips until the White House deems it safe to report, either once the trip is almost complete or the President is wheels up back to the United States.\n\nAs the buzz picked up on Twitter and it was becoming more apparent that Trump was heading to the Middle East, the secret embargo was lifted, and reporters struggling to get internet connections were finally allowed to file, confirming many 'avgeeks' suspicions of a secret presidential trip."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open . During that 18-year span, the mortality rate for youth due to opioid poisoningsnearly tripled.\n\n\"What began more than 2 decades ago as a public health problem primarily among young and middle-aged white males is now an epidemic of prescription and illicit opioid abuse that is taking a toll on all segments of US society, including the pediatric population,\" researchers wrote. \"Millions of children and adolescents are now routinely exposed in their homes, schools and communities to these potent and addictive drugs.\"\n\nResearch released earlier this year in the journal Pediatrics showed that the number of children admitted to hospitals for opioid overdoses nearly doubled from 2004 to 2015.\n\nThis new study set out to examine who's dying.\n\nLooking at the numbers\n\nOf the 8,986 children and adolescents who died from opioid poisonings over the 18-year period, 6,567 (about 73%) were male and 7,921 (about 88%) were adolescents ranging in age from 15 to 19.

Hispanic youth accounted for more than 10% of the deaths, while non-Hispanic black youth were about 7% of the death total.\n\nPrescription opioids accounted for 73% of the deaths, but heroin killed nearly 1,900 (about 24%) of those age 15 to 19.\n\nThe bulk of these opioid deaths, nearly 81% of them, were unintentional.

As a contract nurse, she has worked \"for just about every hospital within two hours of my home.\"\n\nToday, the policy \"in every facility that I am aware of\" is to \"waste\" unused medicines down the sink or toilet.\n\n\"If someone is ordered morphine 1 milligram every four hours and it comes supplied in 2-milligram vials, then I have to waste 1 milligram down the sink each time,\" she explained. \"It's ridiculous.\" Imagine all the nurses on all the shifts in all the hospitals across the country doing the same, she said.\n\n\"Every time I waste something, I think I'm destroying my water system,\" she said. \"I've got kids and grandkids. I hate to see us polluting their water like that.\"\n\n'Conflicting rules'\n\nA 2017 study titled \" Drugs down the drain: When nurses object \" begins with an observation: \"Many times during a typical workday, American hospital nurses routinely discard unused portions of narcotics and other controlled substances into municipal water supplies.\" The reason this practice is routine, the authors suggest, stems from inconsistencies in regulations and how they are interpreted by hospitals.\n\n\"There are agencies at the federal, state, and local levels that have issued conflicting rules\" about pharmaceutical disposal methods for hospitals, the authors wrote.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency strongly discourages pouring or flushing pharmaceuticals down the drain in any setting, including at health care facilities, because they may enter and pass through water treatment systems and contaminate the water supply. As part of its rule for managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals, the EPA has banned the \"sewering\" (or pouring down the drain or toilet) of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals at health care facilities.\n\nHowever, this rule, which was only finalized this month, applies only to drugs considered hazardous waste , such as toxic chemotherapy drugs. Most pharmaceuticals do not fall into this category.\n\nIn contrast to the EPA's stance, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised individuals to sewer narcotics and controlled substances , including morphine and other opioids, in order to avoid harm to animals and humans , including children, who could gain access to these powerful and dangerous drugs.\n\n\"To date, scientists have found no evidence of harmful effects to human health from medicines in the environment,\" the FDA website says.\n\nThe FDA does not provide official guidance to hospitals. Still, the recommendation of this federal agency might carry weight with hospital administrators, who must also consider and follow the requirements of the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nRusty Payne, a spokesman for the DEA, explained that diversion is his agency's primary concern when it comes to how hospitals handle pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\"Many problems associated with drug abuse are the result of legitimately made controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into illicit drug traffic,\" the DEA website says. In plain English, doctors, nurses or other hospital staff sometimes steal pharmaceuticals labeled controlled substances by the DEA -- opioids, mostly -- in order to sell them for profit or use themselves.\n\n\"We document the sales, what comes in and out, in terms of controlled substances, not all drugs, just controlled substances,\" Payne said. For example, the DEA demands that painkillers such as morphine and other opioids be \"heavily documented in terms of how they're distributed and administered in a hospital.\"\n\nFor this reason, hospitals and hospital pharmacies have strict regulations that require nurses to document each use of a controlled substance, according to Payne. He's been told that \"it's fairly common\" for hospitals to waste liquid medicines down the sink.\n\nGeneral regulations\n\n\"There aren't too many contaminants that would build up in drinking water,\" said George Cushnie, technical director for the EPA-sponsored Healthcare Resource Center, which provides pollution prevention and environmental information to health care organizations.\n\nBecause most drinking water comes from rivers or reservoirs, \"you're constantly using water, and there's new water coming in, so there's really not an opportunity for it to build up.\"\n\nMike Focazio, program coordinator of the Geological Survey's Toxic Substances Hydrology Program, said his agency has not done testing of waste specifically coming out of hospitals, but it has done \"wastewater studies that come out of what we call sewer sheds -- in other words, a city or a town that does include hospitals.\"\n\n\"We have sampled that water for many years,\" he said. \"We have found that we can detect a variety of pharmaceutical residues at very low levels in quite a lot of different waste streams across the country.\"\n\n'Complicated' mixture of drugs\n\nPharmaceutical water contamination is common knowledge. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report on environmental health reads, \"pharmaceuticals may enter the environment and ultimately drinking water supplies in various ways, such as through the elimination of human and animal waste, disposal of unused medicines down the toilet or drain, veterinary drug usage, hospital waste disposal, and industrial discharges.\"\n\nWhat is unknown, Focazio said, is how much of that is due to hospitals versus people in their homes discarding unused medicines or simply metabolizing medicines, which we excrete in urine and feces that flows into our toilets.\n\nCushnie said his \"gut feeling is, most likely, households are discharging a lot more of their unused meds into the sewer system than hospitals.\" He believes that a larger number of people are using and disposing medications at home compared with the number of patients lying in hospital beds.\n\nWhether pharmaceutical residues in water samples come from hospital or home use, Focazio said, the concentration levels are much higher in some places than in others.\n\n\"If you look at the concentrations that we detect -- even at those high concentrations -- and you compare it to the dose that somebody would take -- even in, again, those places with very high levels or higher than elsewhere -- you'd have to drink enormous amounts of water just to get back to that prescribed dose,\" Focazio said.\n\n\"But the question is: What does it mean from a health standpoint when these low levels get out into the environment?\" he said. The human health effects are unknown. And it's not just one drug, say, one particular antidepressant. It's many brands and types of antidepressants plus an assortment of antihistamines and anti-inflammatories and all sorts of other pharmaceuticals mixed together.\n\n\"It gets very complicated very fast,\" Focazio said.\n\nMedicine or poison?\n\nIncreasingly, environmental scientists are wondering whether the very substances that are meant to cure us -- medicines -- might also pose a threat to our health when found in drinking water. As a result, pharmaceuticals have been listed as \" contaminants of emerging concern \" by the EPA.\n\nIn some cases, contaminants of emerging concern have probably been discharged into the environment for a long time before new and more sensitive detection methods could identify them, notes a GAO report . Harms to aquatic life have been documented by a number of studies , yet possible negative effects for human health are inconclusive. The EPA has begun the process of revising its existing guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.\n\nOther public health agencies, including the UN's World Health Organization, express similar concerns and findings as the EPA. \"There is a substantial margin of safety between the very low concentrations of pharmaceuticals that would be consumed in drinking-water and the minimum therapeutic doses, which suggests a very low risk to human health,\" a recent WHO report finds.\n\n'A whole soup of drugs'\n\nDr. David J.C. Constable, science director of the American Chemical Society's Green Chemistry Institute, explained the rationale behind the WHO report, though he was not involved in it or in decisions made at the EPA.\n\n\"When you take a drug, it is given at a dose which causes a desired therapeutic effect. However, it will cause some physiological response at a lower dose,\" Constable wrote in an email. \"This difference in response vs effect gives a significant margin of safety for most drugs.\" This is why WHO says concentrations well below therapeutic effect are very low risk to human health, he said.\n\nMae Wu, a senior attorney in the health program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said one of its big questions and concerns is that the EPA and other groups, when examining the safety of pharmaceuticals in drinking water, may be basing their assessment on the \"therapeutic\" levels approved by the FDA.\n\n\"But the reality is, once it gets into our drinking water, we are not talking about any one drug, right? We're talking about a whole soup of drugs, and for every location, it's a different mixture,\" she said.\n\nThough toxicologists test chemicals in combinations, they do not test each and every unique combination of mixed drugs and other chemicals found in the sewers of individual cities in the United States.\n\nWu also said that most FDA-approved drugs have been tested only in adults. Young babies and children do not participate in clinical trials that test adult medications for safety and effectiveness, she said, yet babies and children \"are often more vulnerable and more sensitive to these types of things.\"\n\n\"We definitely don't know what's happening there,\" she said.\n\nConstable believes that \"the question of mixtures is what has people in the EPA most concerned.\" The assumption is that the cocktail of chemicals in drinking water, food and air \"can't be good for you,\" he wrote. \"There is a fear of synergistic effects; that is, 1+1 > 2, or that the presence of one compound decreases the body's ability to metabolize another.\"\n\n'Multigenerational impacts'?\n\nThere are additional concerns that low-concentration exposures to chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, are leading to \"multigenerational impacts\" that we have not been able to discern, he said.\n\n\"The problem for everyone is that we just don't really have a good handle on this. No one does, and the debate is that the precautionary principle should be applied,\" Constable wrote in an email. That principle amounts to \"if we don't know, there is no acceptable level,\" he said, and once that point is reached, science begins to devolve into \"a discussion of policy.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince the late '90s, when scientists learned of a variety of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, in the nation's waterways, \"there was a lot of activity by the government and the Pharma industry to systematically assess the extent of pharmaceuticals in the environment,\" Constable wrote. A great deal of work has been going into this \"over many years,\" he said.\n\nFocazio said the US Geological Survey has started looking more recently not just at what can be detected but at \"what does it mean from a health standpoint.\"\n\n\"The human health aspect of this is a little bit out of our wheelhouse, so we are working with other public health agencies to give them the data so at least they know what the levels are,\" he said. The Geological Survey has begun studies on fish and aquatic biota to see how these other life forms are affected.\n\nAwaiting more extensive research into human health effects, simple solutions at the hospital level may be available.\n\n\"There is a company that has a safe box that comes with a neutralizing solution in it that can be used for wasting narcotics, but I have yet to see anyone use it,\" Deesy said, adding that she's asked several hospitals \"to investigate using them with no response.\"\n\nAwareness among hospital staff is also key, she said, and though she tried repeatedly to raise the awareness of health care administrators through local media, she once again hit a brick wall of \"no response.\"\n\n\"We don't need to be destroying our water,\" Deesy said. \"We should be taking care of our water.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "The impact homelessness and the opioid crisis are having on San Francisco streets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/spGi0Rn2zHM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "San Francisco (CNN) Outside the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in downtown San Francisco, a woman urinates on the sidewalk and smokes a crack pipe.\n\nInside her purse are about a dozen used heroin needles. She shoots heroin up to 10 times per day, she says.\n\nAbout 50 yards away, a man injects another woman in the neck with a needle. She puts her thumb in her mouth and blows on it to make her vein more visible. Her right arm is caked with dried blood.\n\nCNN obscured parts of this photo to protect the identity of the subjects.\n\nThis San Francisco neighborhood is home to the headquarters of Uber, Twitter and Salesforce. But stroll around here, and you're also likely to find used drug paraphernalia, trash, and human excrement on the sidewalks, and people lying in various states of consciousness.\n\nPublic drug usage and homelessness are not new problems for the city of San Francisco. But residents say the situation has gotten worse in recent years. As of October, 7,500 complaints about discarded needles have been made this year, compared with 6,363 last year. In 2015, the number was less than 3,000.\n\nIt's moved some locals -- so-called \"video vigilantes\" -- to document the mess they see, in an attempt to get the city's attention.\n\nAdam Mesnick, a restaurateur who lives and works in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, started posting daily photos and videos of people using drugs in public, urinating near his restaurant, or lying passed out on the sidewalk.\n\n\"More mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco,\" Mesnick wrote in one post, accompanied by photos of angry sores on people's backs, hands and legs.\n\nmore mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco, homeless addicts.

In another, human feces lies nestled in front of a doorway. In a video apparently taken from inside Mesnick's restaurant, a man can be seen urinating in a doorway across the street.\n\nMesnick isn't trying to shame homeless people with his Twitter posts, he says, but \"to actually find help for these people.\" He's been giving leftover food from his restaurant to the homeless for the past ten years, he said.\n\nOver the past five or six years, Mesnick says, visible homelessness and drug use on the streets have seemed to spread from areas of San Francisco where they were once concentrated, like the Tenderloin.\n\nThis has been like this since Friday. Yes today is Monday. pic.twitter.com/d91e9MU2VY \u2014 bettersoma (@bettersoma) October 29, 2018\n\n\"It's like third world squalor,\" Mesnick said. \"I'm a small business (owner) trying to exist, and basically surrounded by decay that continues to get worse and worse and worse.\"\n\nOthers fear that the situation will impact tourism. \"If we can't find a solution to this problem,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, CEO of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, \"it will tarnish the city's brand.\"\n\nAnother longtime resident tweets about the state of the neighborhood using the handle @cleanupwestsoma. He asked to remain anonymous because his friends don't know he runs the account, and says he's lived in San Francisco for 21 years, 12 of them in SoMa.\n\n\"I post as I go to work. I'll sometimes come home from lunch and see a giant drug deal going on,\" he said. \"I'll leave and go back to work and see someone going to the bathroom in the street. It blows me away that this continues to happen in the city.\"\n\nMesnick and @cleanupwestsoma want to send a message to city officials about what's happening in their neighborhoods. They often tweet at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who took office in a special election in July after the death of Mayor Ed Lee.\n\n\"You know what? I already had the message, as a native San Franciscan, as someone who's been here all my life,\" Breed told CNN. \"It isn't acceptable.\"\n\nBreed, 44, made tackling homelessness and drug addiction a signature of her campaign platform. She says the city has been making changes since she took office, and that they're slowly starting to have an impact. \"It's not an unsolvable problem,\" she said.\n\nLast week, the mayor announced a detailed plan to direct a $181 million cash windfall the city received from the state to homelessness, affordable housing and related problems. The proposal includes nearly $20 million to be spent on beds for patients who have addiction and mental health problems. An additional $4 million would go toward expanding street cleaning.\n\nAnd Breed says visible progress has already been made.\n\n\"If you walk with me right now, you will see the difference,\" she said. \"You'll see more police officers. You'll see the homeless outreach team. You'll see people power-washing on a regular basis and picking up trash.\" Tent encampments are down by 27% since she took office, she said.\n\nKevin Schwing, who works in SoMa, said that despite the city's efforts, he doesn't see a change in the numbers of people on the streets.\n\n\"I don't really know what the city can do,\" he said. \"The city cleans up sidewalks every day. But I don't see any difference in terms of the amount of people.\"\n\n\"I see human waste. Injections. Probably 10 times per day,\" he said. \"Sometimes people look like they're dead.\"\n\nBreed says the city is cracking down on drug dealing, and aims to open at least 1,000 new shelter beds by the end of 2020.\n\nAnd she's looking at new ways to approach these entrenched problems, she says. Breed supports safe injection sites -- facilities where people can inject heroin in a private setting and under the supervision of health care workers. The sites would \"not only be a way to get people off the streets and get the needles off the streets, but to get people into treatment,\" Breed said. California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have allowed safe injection sites in the state.\n\nShe also supports conservatorship programs for the severely mentally ill, which would allow the state to \"make decisions for them in order to place them into mental health stabilization beds, instead of our criminal justice system.\" Gov. Brown recently signed a bill that would allow such action to take place.\n\nBreed says she hopes the \"video vigilantes\" tag 311, the city's non-emergency complaint service center, in their posts. The information they're putting out helps the city address challenges in specific neighborhoods, she said.\n\nThe city's Department of Public Health recently partnered with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, essentially hiring contract workers to fan the streets and collect used needles.\n\nCrisis intervention teams have also stepped up their efforts to provide addicts with the drug buprenorphine, a narcotic to help reduce a person's addiction to heroin and other opioids.\n\n\"We go to people that are using drugs and offer them treatment instead of the traditional model which has people coming into a clinic,\" said Dr. Naveena Bobba, the department's deputy director of health.\n\nThe city has also launched the so-called \"poop patrol,\" a team that responds to complaints of feces on city streets.\n\nSoMa resident Alesia Panajota said she sees an impact. \"They're doing the best they can,\" she said. \"I think things are getting better under London Breed.\"\n\nSan Francisco may also see an influx of cash to help solve the crisis, after a controversial ballot measure passed in November. Known as \"Prop C,\" the measure is viewed as a \"homeless tax\" -- it aims to raise $300 million a year to spend on homeless services by taxing big businesses.\n\nSalesforce Chairman and Co-CEO Marc Benioff spent at least $7 million of his own money to help ensure Prop C's passage. \"We have to say enough is enough,\" he recently told CNN.\n\nBut legal challenges could prevent the city from receiving the funds for several years.\n\nIn the meantime, Mesnick keeps posting. He recently put up a video interview with a homeless man talking about how difficult it is to find a place to go to the bathroom after dark.\n\n\"Help this guy,\" Mesnick wrote. \"Keep the restrooms open at night? Perhaps we change usage of our space and make it a bathroom share? Better than on our front stoop...\"\n\n\"We are in a severe epidemic here,\" he told CNN. \"My angle may seem to be a little rough around the edges, but it's really about compassion.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "One city's answer to preventing teen e-cigarette use: Sell in adult-only stores", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/a0oHJ8rqllg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Attempting to beat back the rise of vaping among teens, the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, voted this month to limit e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes to the shelves of tobacco stores open only to customers 21 and older.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Massachusetts raising the legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21, which goes into effect on December 31.\n\nSomerville's move, the first of its kind in the state and possibly the nation, goes further by taking menthol and e-cigarettes out of shops, like convenience stores, that teens can enter.

with its market share growing month by month throughout the year.\n\nBut he added that the industry consensus was that the market would fall by another 17% during 2019 and therefore it would not be

business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said the fall of HMV had been \"coming for many years\".\n\nShe added: \"It has been revealed that the business turnaround has been built on a bed of sand rather than rocks.\"\n\nAnalysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent\n\nWith video and music still its main sources of revenue, HMV was always likely to be one of the retailers struggling to make it through the Christmas holidays.\n\nBut this is about more than a struggle to adapt to changing consumer habits.\n\nIn millions of households, watching a movie now means turning to Netflix rather than selecting a DVD, and listening to music means streaming it from Spotify instead of heading up to the attic to hunt through old CDs.\n\nHMV faced the same pressures of low consumer confidence, high rents and a lacklustre Christmas that have put other high street names in danger.\n\nAnd don't be surprised if this is not the end of the story.\n\nThe Entertainment Retailers Association points out that when you tot up music, video and games there is still a market of nearly \u00a32bn worth of physical products.\n\nBig releases such as The Greatest Showman, Ed Sheeran and Adele have still attracted millions who want to own a physical copy.\n\nSo maybe there is another turnaround specialist out there to keep the HMV name alive into its second century.\n\nWeak retailing\n\nRichard Lim, Chief Executive, Retail Economics, said HMV's situation came amid a weak retailing climate. \"Poor Christmas trading has claimed its first victim,\" he said.\n\nBut the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, Kim Bayley, said there was hope.\n\n\"What is clear is that following its first move into administration in 2013, HMV has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround and it is conceivable that this will happen again.\n\n\"The fact is the physical entertainment market is still worth up to \u00a32bn a year so there is plenty of business there.\"\n\nWhile Christmas is normally a time of higher revenues for retailers, the number of shoppers hitting the post-Christmas sales dipped this year.\n\nBritain's shops have also faced uncertainty over Brexit,

journalist Paul Lewis has advised people to use any HMV gift cards immediately.\n\nAccording to consumer publication Which?, whether vouchers and returns will be accepted following administration depends on the administrators.\n\nTheir role is to \"try and save the company\", and in doing so, they \"may take the decision not to accept returns\".\n\n'Sand not rocks'\n\nHilco's ownership saw HMV host live events in store, with musicians including Kylie Minogue, Stormzy and The Darkness.\n\nDigital music revenue overtook sales of physical formats like CDs and records for the first time in 2012.\n\nSince then, online shopping, downloads and streaming provided by platforms such as Amazon, Spotify and Netflix, have continued to eat into sales of physical music.\n\nJulie Palmer, partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said the fall of HMV had been \"coming for many years\".\n\nShe added: \"It has been revealed that the business turnaround has been built on a bed of sand rather than rocks.\"\n\nAnalysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent\n\nWith video and music still its main sources of revenue, HMV was always likely to be one of the retailers struggling to make it through the Christmas holidays.\n\nBut this is about more than a struggle to adapt to changing consumer habits.\n\nIn millions of households, watching a movie now means turning to Netflix rather than selecting a DVD, and listening to music means streaming it from Spotify instead of heading up to the attic to hunt through old CDs.\n\nHMV faced the same pressures of low consumer confidence, high rents and a lacklustre Christmas that have put other high street names in danger.\n\nAnd don't be surprised if this is not the end of the story.\n\nThe Entertainment Retailers Association points out that when you tot up music, video and games there is still a market of nearly \u00a32bn worth of physical products.\n\nBig releases such as The Greatest Showman, Ed Sheeran and Adele have still attracted millions who want to own a physical copy.\n\nSo maybe there is another turnaround specialist out there to keep the HMV name alive into its second century.\n\nWeak retailing\n\nRichard Lim, Chief Executive, Retail Economics, said HMV's situation came amid a weak retailing climate. \"Poor Christmas trading has claimed its first victim,\" he said.\n\nBut the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, Kim Bayley, said there was hope.\n\n\"What is clear is that following its first move into administration in 2013, HMV has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround and it is conceivable that this will happen again.\n\n\"The fact is the physical entertainment market is still worth up to \u00a32bn a year so there is plenty of business there.\"\n\nWhile Christmas is normally a time of higher revenues for retailers, the number of shoppers hitting the post-Christmas sales dipped this year.\n\nBritain's shops have also faced uncertainty over Brexit, which sparked a fall in the pound and therefore raised the price of imported goods, as well as rising labour costs, higher business property taxes and unseasonably warm weather.\n\nImage copyright

allowing Parliament to express its \"concerns or objections\", and lowering the risk of it rejecting eventual negotiated agreements.\n\nThe committee also recommends that the government hold regular consultations with interested parties, such as businesses, to enable them to share their opinions while the devolved administrations should have a statutory role in the process.\n\nThe SNP's Angus MacNeil, who chairs the committee, said the government's current plans for Parliamentary input were \"characteristically vague\".\n\n\"Our report makes an unequivocal argument for transparency over secrecy, consultation over concealment, and parliamentary debate over simple rubber-stamping,\" he said.\n\n\"If the proper processes and protections are not put in place from the outset, the government may fail to realise the UK-wide post-Brexit benefits it has gone to such lengths to promote.\"\n\nA Department for International Trade spokesperson said it had been \"very clear that we will not lower food standards as part of any new free trade agreement\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "The simple tips to improve your health", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46618192", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:49", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Building self-awareness, through things like meditation, can boost our mental and physical wellbeing\n\nIf you are contemplating a new year's health kick, you could be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed.\n\nDo yoga, run, lift weights, cut the carbs, or the fat (depending on the particular diet that's in vogue), ditch the booze, reduce your stress.\n\nIt is easy to feel like your life needs to be overhauled in order to be a healthy, happy human being.\n\nBut what if you were to make only one change?\n\nWe asked experts what single thing they would recommend people should do to improve their health, assuming they are an adult who is otherwise healthy and not a smoker.\n\nFocus on the mind\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt is easy to only think about our physical health.\n\nBut according to Dr Nadine Sammy, associate lecturer for sport and exercise sciences at the University of Exeter, we should also be focusing on improving our minds by building self-awareness.\n\nYou might think of this as something that prevents us from embarrassing ourselves, but, according to Dr Sammy, it is much more than this.\n\nSelf-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your moods, emotions and drives, and building it can play a crucial role in improving mental and physical wellbeing over time.\n\n\"By understanding your feelings, motivations and behaviours in more depth, you can begin to act more consciously in order to make better choices for yourself,\" she says.\n\n\"For instance, what is your motivation to exercise? When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?\"\n\nThere are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.\n\n\"Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,\" she adds.\n\nAdopt a dog\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are particular health benefits in adopting a dog, says Dr Rhys Thatcher\n\nA gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.\n\nBut though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University.\n\nInstead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping.\n\nBut there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says.\n\nIf you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption.\n\n\"This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,\" says Dr Thatcher.\n\nGet your 30 a week\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say diversity of plant-based foods is also important\n\nWe have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nBut according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity.\n\nWe should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.\n\nThat is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health.\n\nThe bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.\n\nAllergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOne way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi.\n\n\"Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix. Instead of buying one type of seed buy the four-seed mix,\" she says.\n\nSmile more often\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do not spend so much time focusing on arbitrary matters, do something that makes you smile instead\n\nAfter the excesses of the holiday season, many of us will be planning to lose a couple of stone or setting a target for how many times we go to the gym each week.\n\nBut the problem with \"arbitrary\" goals like these is that they are often difficult to achieve and failing to reach them can be demoralising, says Dr James Gill.\n\nInstead, he recommends focusing first on trying to be happier.\n\n\"There are lists of specific things that you can do to actively make your life healthier, but if you are not enjoying your life you probably won't stick to any difficult or challenging changes for the coming year,\" says Dr Gill, a locum GP and researcher at Warwick Medical School.\n\nBut how do you go about becoming happier?\n\nDr Gill recommends making one change in your life that will make you smile more often. At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it.\n\n\"Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year.\"\n\nAnd finally, get enough sleep\n\nIt may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults).\n\nEven being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter.\n\nThere are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.\n\nBut Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Couple have baby after Facebook group pays for IVF", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-46700787", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:50", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Marisha Chaplin Image caption Baby Isla was born thanks to mothers the couple have never met raising \u00a32,000 for IVF\n\nA couple who underwent IVF treatment paid for by friends from a Facebook group have had a baby girl.\n\nMarisha Chaplin, 26, and Jon Hibbs, 29, who met while undergoing cancer treatment, had already had a daughter through IVF but could not afford a second round.\n\nA band of social media mums secretly raised \u00a32,000 for the couple - despite never having met them.\n\nMs Chaplin gave birth to Isla on Saturday via Caesarean section.\n\nThe new mother-of-two, from Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire, said she broke the news to members of the Facebook group as soon as she could.\n\n'So grateful'\n\n\"I messaged them on the Saturday morning when I was still pretty much out of it from all the drugs I had from the operation,\" she said.\n\n\"It's amazing, it really is.

Sometimes it's just easier not to go out, as I get too tempted.\n\n\"Even if others don't pressurise me, you feel a silent pressure. It's a bit like being a vegan, it gets other people's backs up because they feel guilty or judged.\"\n\nHaig notes British society's obsession with drinking. \"As soon as we get that off switch we drink.

Recent figures from a study by the University of London showed that almost a third of young people don't drink at all.\n\nEven so, young people, particularly those with mental health issues, still struggle with alcohol.\n\nJennifer Griffin, psychotherapist and general manager of Turn2me - an online charitable mental health website for young people, says many of those they help find social occasions that revolve around drinking difficult.\n\n\"Alcohol is linked to anxiety and depression. Yet socialising is how young people develop a connection to their peers. If they choose not to socialise because they will be exposed to alcohol, then they might alienate themselves and suffer from loneliness.\n\n\"The [buying a] round system is also an issue, it's lovely and generous, but it's difficult to resist.\"\n\nGriffin suggests working out a strategy in advance, and prioritising your own needs.\n\nAs awareness of the health risks grow, not drinking, or cutting back on drinking, is becoming increasingly common.

Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on a baby's sex, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Madagascar pochard: World's rarest bird gets new home", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46703335", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Conservationists hope to save a species of duck called the Madagascar pochard from extinction\n\nThe rarest bird in the world - a species of duck called the Madagascar pochard - has been given a new home in time for the new year.\n\nAn international team of researchers released 21 of the birds at a lake in the north of Madagascar.\n\nIt is a step towards the recovery of a species that just over a decade ago was thought to be extinct.\n\nRescuing the species could also be a first step in protecting Madagascar's threatened wetlands.\n\nWhy is this species under such threat?\n\nWhen it wasn't seen for 15 years, the Madagascar pochard was believed to have been wiped out completely. Then a tiny group of the birds was rediscovered in 2006 at one remote lake.\n\nThese were the last 25 Madagascar pochards on the planet.\n\nImage copyright WWT Image caption The captive-bred pochards are now settling in to their new home\n\nWetland habitats in the country have been so polluted and damaged that these few remaining birds had been forced into this last untouched area.\n\nBut, as Rob Shaw, head of conservation programmes at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) explained to BBC News, they were only \"clinging on to existence in a place not really suited to them\".\n\nTheir last pristine refuge was too deep and too cold for the pochards to thrive.\n\n\"The threats that they face across the rest of Madagascar - and why they've been wiped out so extensively - are vast,\" explained Rob Shaw.\n\n\"They range from sedimentation, invasive species, pollution, poor agricultural practises - a whole suite of problems that create the perfect storm making it very difficult for a species like the Madagascar pochard to survive.\"\n\nHow has the species been rescued?\n\nImage copyright WWT Image caption Breeding the ducks in captivity has been key\n\nIn a painstaking effort - it has taken more than a decade of work. The international team, which included WWT, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, The Peregrine Fund and the Government of Madagascar, rescued a clutch of pochard eggs and raised them in captivity.\n\nImage copyright WWT Image caption Floating aviaries have been installed at Lake Sofia to protect the ducks\n\nThey then scoured Madagascar for the best site to bring the captive-bred birds back to the wild, settling on Lake Sofia in the north of the country.\n\nThe team has worked closely with the local communities around the lake that rely on its water, fish and plants, as WWT's Nigel Jarrett explained: \"It takes a village to raise a child, so the old African proverb goes - but in this case it has taken a village to raise a duck. We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade.\n\n\"Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.\"\n\nThe team hopes that making this reintroduction a success - and bringing back a bird that was on the very brink of extinction - will provide a powerful example, not just for how to save the most threatened species but how communities can support both people and wildlife in such valuable habitats, even in areas of significant poverty.\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Huge costs of warming impacts in 2018", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46637102", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Heat waves in Europe in 2018 saw big impacts on agriculture\n\nExtreme weather events linked to climate change cost thousands of lives and caused huge damage throughout the world in 2018, say Christian Aid.\n\nThe charity's report identified ten events that cost more than $1bn each, with four costing more than $7bn each.\n\nScientists have shown that the chances of heat waves in Europe were influenced directly by human-related warming.\n\nOther events, say the authors, are due to shifts in weather patterns, said to be a consequence of climate change.\n\nAccording to the report the most financially costly disasters linked to rising temperatures were Hurricanes Florence and Michael, with costs said to be around $17bn for the former, and $15bn for the latter.\n\nResearch published at the time showed that the rains accompanying Hurricane Florence were made 50% worse than they would have been without human influenced warming.\n\nWith Hurricane Michael, experts say that human activities drove the emissions that made the water warmer, adding fuel and speed to the storm.\n\nIn Japan, 2018 was the summer of extremes with flooding and heatwaves causing huge impacts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Flooding persisted for weeks after Hurricane Florence hit South Carolina\n\nThe floods killed at least 230 people and caused $7bn worth of damage, which were then followed by Typhoon Jebi, the most powerful storm to hit the country for 25 years.\n\nEurope also saw record heatwaves - with researchers showing that climate change likely doubled the chances of the events happening.\n\nA separate study from the Met Office looking at the UK suggested that the extreme heat was made 30 times more likely because of rising temperatures.\n\nThe Christian Aid study says even where scientists have not done attribution studies linking events to climate change, they believe that warming is driving shifts in weather patterns that make droughts and wildfires more likely.\n\n\"Climate change is something still often talked about as a future problem, not least because we know the consequences of the warming climate are so devastating and don't want to face up to what is already happening,\" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.\n\n\"This report shows that for many people, climate change is having devastating impacts on their lives and livelihoods right now.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump EPA Says Limits on Mercury Emissions from Coal Plants Not Necessary", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-epa-says-limits-on-mercury-emissions-from-coal-plants-not-necessary/4720132.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration on Friday said limits on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants were no longer necessary as their costs outweighed the benefits, a move environmentalists said was favorable for the coal industry and could increase health hazards.\n\nUnder the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, or MATS, enacted under former President Barack Obama, coal plants have been forced to install expensive equipment to cut output of mercury, which can harm pregnant women and put infants and children at risk of developmental problems.\n\nSince August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been reconsidering the justification for the rule.\n\nElectric utilities have pushed back on the potential loosening of requirements, saying they have already invested in technology to cut emissions of the dangerous pollutant.\n\nIn a statement issued Friday during a partial government shutdown, the EPA said the emission standards of the MATS rule would remain in place.

Not to fight \u2014 not yet, at least \u2014 but to help the men and women who do.\n\nThese robots aren't taking up arms, but the companies making them have waged a different kind of battle. At stake is a contract worth almost half a billion dollars for 3,000 backpack-sized robots that can defuse bombs and scout enemy positions. Competition for the work has spilled over into Congress and federal court.\n\nThe project and others like it could someday help troops \u201clook around the corner, over the next hillside and let the robot be in harm's way and let the robot get shot,\u201d said Paul Scharre, a military technology expert at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe big fight over small robots opens a window into the intersection of technology and national defense and shows how fear that China could surpass the U.S. drives even small tech startups to play geopolitics to outmaneuver rivals. It also raises questions about whether defense technology should be sourced solely to American companies to avoid the risk of tampering by foreign adversaries.\n\nRegardless of which companies prevail, the competition foreshadows a future in which robots, which are already familiar military tools, become even more common. The Army's immediate plans alone envision a new fleet of 5,000 ground robots of varying sizes and levels of autonomy. The Marines, Navy and Air Force are making similar investments.\n\n\u201cMy personal estimate is that robots will play a significant role in combat inside of a decade or a decade and a half,\u201d the chief of the Army, Gen. Mark Milley, said in May at a Senate hearing where he appealed for more money to modernize the force.\n\nMilley warned that adversaries like China and Russia \u201care investing heavily and very quickly\u201d in the use of aerial, sea and ground robots. And now, he added, \u201cwe are doing the same.\u201d\n\nSuch a shift will be a \u201chuge game-changer for combat,\u201d said Scharre, who credits Milley's leadership for the push.\n\nThe promise of such big Pentagon investments in robotics has been a boon for U.S. defense contractors and technology startups. But the situation is murkier for firms with foreign ties.\n\nConcerns that popular commercial drones made by Chinese company DJI could be vulnerable to spying led the Army to ban their use by soldiers in 2017. And in August, the Pentagon published a report that said China is conducting espionage to acquire foreign military technologies \u2014 sometimes by using students or researchers as \u201cprocurement agents and intermediaries.\u201d At a December defense expo in Egypt, some U.S. firms spotted what they viewed as Chinese knock-offs of their robots.\n\nThe China fears came to a head in a bitter competition between Israeli firm Roboteam and Massachusetts-based Endeavor Robotics over a series of major contracts to build the Army's next generation of ground robots. Those machines will be designed to be smarter and easier to deploy than the remote-controlled rovers that have helped troops disable bombs for more than 15 years.\n\nThe biggest contract \u2014 worth $429 million \u2014 calls for mass producing 25-pound robots that are light, easily maneuverable and can be \u201ccarried by infantry for long distances without taxing the soldier,\u201d said Bryan McVeigh, project manager for force projection at the Army's research and contracting center in Warren, Michigan.\n\nOther bulkier prototypes are tank-sized unmanned supply vehicles that have been tested in recent weeks in the rough and wintry terrain outside Fort Drum, New York.\n\nA third $100 million contract \u2014 won by Endeavor in late 2017 \u2014 is for a midsized reconnaissance and bomb-disabling robot nicknamed the Centaur.\n\nThe competition escalated into a legal fight when Roboteam accused Endeavor, a spinoff of iRobot, which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners, of dooming its prospects for those contracts by hiring a lobbying firm that spread false information to politicians about the Israeli firm's Chinese investors.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Roboteam's lawsuit in April.\n\n\u201cThey alleged that we had somehow defamed them,\u201d said Endeavor CEO Sean Bielat, a former Marine who twice ran for Congress as a Republican. \u201cWhat we had done was taken publicly available documents and presented them to members of Congress because we think there's a reason to be concerned about Chinese influence on defense technologies.\u201d\n\nThe lobbying firm, Boston-based Sachem Strategies, circulated a memo to members of the House Armed Services Committee. Taking up Endeavor's cause was Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat \u2014 and, like Bielat, a Marine veteran \u2014 who wrote a letter to a top military official in December 2016 urging the Army to \u201cexamine the evidence of Chinese influence\u201d before awarding the robot contracts.\n\nSix other lawmakers later raised similar concerns.\n\nRoboteam CEO Elad Levy declined to comment on the dispute but said the firm is still \u201cworking very closely with U.S. forces,\u201d including the Air Force, and other countries. But it's no longer in the running for the lucrative Army opportunities.\n\nEndeavor is. Looking something like a miniature forklift on tank treads, its prototype called the Scorpion has been zipping around a test track behind an office park in a Boston suburb.\n\nThe only other finalist is just 20 miles away at the former Massachusetts headquarters of Foster-Miller, now a part of British defense contractor Qinetiq. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The contract is expected to be awarded in early 2019.\n\nBoth Endeavor and Qinetiq have strong track records with the U.S. military, having supplied it with its earlier generation of ground robots such as Endeavor's Packbot and Qinetiq's Talon and Dragon Runner.\n\nAfter hiding the Scorpion behind a shroud at a recent Army conference, Bielat and engineers at Endeavor showed it for the first time publicly to The Associated Press in November. Using a touchscreen controller that taps into the machine's multiple cameras, an engineer navigated it through tunnels, over a playground-like structure and through an icy pool of water, and used its grabber to pick up objects.\n\nIt's a smaller version of its predecessor, the Packbot, which was first used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2002 and later became one of soldiers' essential tools for safely disabling improvised explosives in Iraq. Bielat said the newer Scorpion and Centaur robots are designed to be easier for the average soldier to use quickly without advanced technical training.\n\n\u201cTheir primary job is to be a rifle squad member,\u201d Bielat said. \u201cThey don't have time to mess with the robot. They're going to demand greater levels of autonomy.\u201d\n\nIt will be a while, however, before any of these robots become fully autonomous. The Defense Department is cautious about developing battlefield machines that make their own decisions. That sets the U.S. apart from efforts by China and Russia to design artificially intelligent warfighting arsenals.\n\nA November report from the Congressional Research Service said that despite the Pentagon's \u201cinsistence\u201d that a human must always be in the loop, the military could soon feel compelled to develop fully autonomous systems if rivals do the same. Or, as with drones, humans will still pull the trigger, but a far-away robot will lob the bombs.\n\nSaid P.W. Singer, a strategist for the New America Foundation think tank: \u201cChina has showed off armed ones. Russia has showed them off. It's coming.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Once Again Threatens to Shut US-Mexico Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-to-entirely-close-us-mexico-border-unless-wall-demands-met/4719661.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday once again threatened to close the entire U.S.-Mexico border and cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador if Congress fails to give him money to fund the border wall.\n\n\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump also asked to change the \u201cridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe comments come as the U.S. government enters the seventh day of a partial shutdown as a budget standoff remains between Trump, who wants $5 billion in wall funding, and Democratic lawmakers, who back a modest increase in overall border security funding but resolutely oppose a wall.\n\nClosing the U.S.-Mexican border would mean disrupting a $1.68 billion-a-day trade relationship between the two countries, according to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\n\n\nImmigrant advocates have called the move to seal the border \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump has declined to comment on whether he might accept less than $5 billion for wall funding.

Both are scheduled to hold pro forma sessions with no business conducted Dec. 31.\n\nTweeting earlier in the day, Trump asserted that \"Border Patrol Agents want the wall\" and touted a \"Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking, Gang Members & Criminals from coming into our country.\"\n\nWhen asked Wednesday how long he thinks the shutdown will last, Trump told reporters, \"Whatever it takes.\"\n\nHe declined to comment on whether he might back away from the $5 billion wall funding demand.\n\n'Chaos'\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, blamed Trump for \"plunging the country into chaos\" and noted that, weeks ago, Trump said he would be \"proud\" to \"own\" a shutdown over border wall funding.\n\nIn a joint statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and presumed incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said, \"The president wanted the shutdown, but seems not to know how to get himself out of it.\"\n\nAny formula to fully fund the U.S. government will have to be approved by both houses of Congress and signed by Trump. Many lawmakers went home this week for the Christmas holiday and have no plans to return before early January.\n\nLast week, the Senate unanimously approved a spending bill with no funds set aside to build a wall. The House declined to vote on it, instead passing its own spending bill with the wall funding Trump seeks. That bill is a non-starter for Senate Democrats, who can block such legislation.\n\nShift in House\n\nRepublicans currently control both houses of Congress and the White House, but in one week, Democrats will take over in the House while Republicans will add two seats to their current Senate advantage.\n\nOnce sworn in next week, the new House Democratic majority will be able to pass any spending bill it chooses. It remains to be seen, however, how Senate Republicans will react to a House bill that lacks wall funding.\n\nThe shutdown is affecting about 800,000 federal workers. About half of them are still going to work while the rest are furloughed. None will be paid until the shutdown is over.\n\nIn his morning prayer, Senate Chaplain Barry Black appeared to reference the funding standoff and request divine intervention.\n\n\"Stay close to our lawmakers,\" the chaplain said. \"Deliver them from the mire of division and despair as you lead them to your desired destination.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Feinstein Seeks Hearing to Probe Migrant Children's Deaths", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/feinstein-seeks-hearing-to-probe-migrant-children-s-death-/4718940.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Sen.

Before birth, babies can have a split, or cleft, in their lip and the roof of the mouth. This split normally closes between the 6th to 11th week of pregnancy. If this doesn't happen, and the baby is born with this split, doctors can usually fix it. But if the cleft isn't fixed, the baby can have serious health problems and a shortened life.\n\nIn the U.S. and other developed countries, corrective surgery is done when a baby is between three months and 18 months old. Surgical intervention is less common in less developed nations.\n\nDr. Albert Oh, a pediatric plastic surgeon, said he performs one or two corrective surgeries a week at Children's National hospital in Washington.\n\n\"We\u2019re one of the busiest centers in the United States, and so my partner and I, we average over a hundred primary cases per year.\"\n\n\n\nAbout one out of every 1,500 babies in the U.S. is born with a cleft palate. One out of every 900 babies is born with cleft lip. Babies of African descent have lower odds \u2014 one out of every 1,200 births.\n\nDr. Yang Chai at the University of Southern California said Asians are most at risk.\n\n\"If you look at a patient population worldwide, if you are Asian, the prevalence is about 1 out of 700.\"\n\nThese children are often stigmatized because of the way they look. But complications from a cleft lip and cleft palate go beyond the cosmetic. They impact speech and cause dental problems. A baby with a cleft palate cannot suck and is at risk of being malnourished. Malnutrition, in turn, causes stunted growth.\n\nDr. Ben Gitterman, a pediatrician who has worked as a volunteer in low-income countries to help these children, said the experience was life-changing.\n\n\"Seeing these kids and thinking, 'What a cute little 3 or 4 year old,' and finding that 3 or 4 year old was 7, 8 or 9. And because of the fact that they couldn\u2019t process food, they couldn\u2019t eat well. They had been so stunted ... by malnutrition. Not malnutrition from the lack of food in the community, but because they couldn\u2019t feed properly because of the cleft lip and palate situation. These were tiny little kids, and I was in shock.\"\n\nGitterman has volunteered numerous times with Operation Smile, one of the charities that organizes surgical missions to help these children. In a Skype interview with Dr. Bill Magee, Operation Smile's founder, Magee said his organization's mission has expanded in the more than 35 years of its existence.\n\n\"Up until about 1999, all of our volunteers pretty much came out of the United States. Today, 70 to 80 percent of our missions are done by local people in their countries that we have trained.\"\n\nCharitable organizations perform more than 80 percent of cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries in Vietnam, according to a 2016 study issued by Dr. William Magee III and his colleagues at the University of Southern California. Magee III is the son of the founder of Operation Smile.\n\nThe report showed how difficult it is for parents to get the surgery their children need in low and middle income countries. It's common in these countries for medical care to be paid in advance, which many families cannot afford.\n\nOperation Smile is working to change that.\n\n\"It\u2019s given us this incredible opportunity to understand how the infrastructure of surgery is so important ... and how to advance that infrastructure in countries all over the world,\" Magee said.\n\nAs for what causes this condition, genetic factors account for about 30 percent of cleft conditions. The mother's health is a contributing factor, but scientists are still searching for other causes with the hope of one day being able to prevent children from being born with cleft lips or palates."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Aid Group: 10 Worst Climate-Linked Disasters of 2018 Caused $85B in Damage", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/worst-climate-linked-disasters-of-2018-caused-85b-in-damage/4718180.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "From floods to extreme heat, 10 of the worst climate-linked disasters in 2018 caused at least $84.8 billion worth of damage, said a study released by the charity Christian Aid on Thursday.\n\nExtreme weather driven by climate change hit every populated continent this year, the British relief organization said, warning urgent action was needed to combat global warming.\n\n\"This report shows that for many people, climate change is having devastating impacts on their lives and livelihoods right now,\" said Kat Kramer, who heads Christian Aid's work on climate issues, in a statement.\n\nExperts say a warming world will lead to sweltering heatwaves, more extreme rainfall, shrinking harvests and worsening water shortages, causing both monetary losses and human misery.\n\nAlmost 200 nations are aiming to limit the rise in average world temperatures under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, though some warn progress to meet targets has been slow.\n\nThe 20 warmest years on record have been within the last 22 years, the United Nations said last month, with 2018 on track to be the fourth hottest.\n\nThe most expensive climate-linked weather events of 2018 were Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which caused at least $32 billion worth of damage as they slammed into the United States, the Caribbean and parts of Central America, the report said.\n\nThe United States also suffered at least $9 billion of losses from wildfires that caused dozens of deaths and destroyed thousands of homes in California.\n\nJapan was badly hit by severe floods over the summer, followed by the powerful Typhoon Jebi in autumn, which together caused more than $9.3 billion in damages, said the report.\n\nIt also cited droughts in Europe, floods in southern India and Typhoon Mangkhut in the Philippines and China among the most expensive climate-linked disasters of 2018.\n\nThe report's authors collated total cost figures using data from sources including governments, banks and insurance firms, though in some cases the figures only covered insured losses and also failed to take account of the human costs of such events.\n\nThey added that rising temperatures would continue to drive extreme weather events as they urged action to prevent further global warming which would impact the poorest and most vulnerable communities hardest.\n\n\"The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,\" said Michael Mann, professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State University, in a statement on the study.\n\n\"The world's weather is becoming more extreme before our eyes - the only thing that can stop this destructive trend from escalating is a rapid fall in carbon emissions.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "US Legal Marijuana Industry Had Banner Year in 2018", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-legal-marijuana-industry-had-banner-year-in-2018/4718174.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "The last year was a 12-month champagne toast for the legal marijuana industry as the global market exploded and cannabis pushed its way further into the financial and cultural mainstream.\n\nLiberal California became the largest legal U.S. marketplace, while conservative Utah and Oklahoma embraced medical marijuana. Canada ushered in broad legalization , and Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court set the stage for that country to follow.\n\nU.S. drug regulators approved the first marijuana-based pharmaceutical to treat kids with a form of epilepsy, and billions of investment dollars poured into cannabis companies. Even main street brands like Coca-Cola said they are considering joining the party.\n\n\u201cI have been working on this for decades, and this was the year that the movement crested,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat working to overturn the federal ban on pot. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is all coming to a head.\u201d\n\nWith buzz building across the globe, the momentum will continue into 2019.\n\nLuxembourg is poised to become the first European country to legalize recreational marijuana, and South Africa is moving in that direction. Thailand legalized medicinal use of marijuana on Tuesday, and other Southeastern Asian countries may follow South Korea\u2019s lead in legalizing cannabidiol, or CBD. It\u2019s a non-psychoactive compound found in marijuana and hemp plants and used for treatment of certain medical problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the U.S. now. It\u2019s spreading,\u201d said Ben Curren, CEO of Green Bits, a San Jose, California, company that develops software for marijuana retailers and businesses.\n\nCurren\u2019s firm is one of many that blossomed as the industry grew. He started the company in 2014 with two friends. Now, he has 85 employees, and the company\u2019s software processes $2.5 billion in sales transactions a year for more than 1,000 U.S. retail stores and dispensaries.\n\nGreen Bits raised $17 million in April, pulling in money from investment firms including Snoop Dogg\u2019s Casa Verde Capital. Curren hopes to expand internationally by 2020.\n\n\u201cA lot of the problem is keeping up with growth,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal marijuana was a $10.4 billion industry in the U.S. in 2018 with a quarter-million jobs devoted just to the handling of marijuana plants, said Beau Whitney, vice president and senior economist at New Frontier Data, a leading cannabis market research and data analysis firm. There are many other jobs that don\u2019t involve direct work with the plants but they are harder to quantify, Whitney said.\n\nInvestors poured $10 billion into cannabis in North America in 2018, twice what was invested in the last three years combined, he said, and the combined North American market is expected to reach more than $16 billion in 2019.\n\n\u201cInvestors are getting much savvier when it comes to this space because even just a couple of years ago, you\u2019d throw money at it and hope that something would stick,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now investors are much more discerning.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, U.S. lawmakers see that success and want it for their states.\n\nNearly two-thirds of U.S. states now have legalized some form of medical marijuana.\n\nVoters in November made Michigan the 10th state \u2014 and first in the Midwest \u2014 to legalize recreational marijuana. Governors in New York and New Jersey are pushing for a similar law in their states next year, and momentum for broad legalization is building in Pennsylvania and Illinois.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s legalize the adult use of recreational marijuana once and for all,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week.\n\nState lawmakers in Nebraska just formed a campaign committee to put a medical cannabis initiative to voters in 2020. Nebraska shares a border with Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana, and Iowa, which recently started a limited medical marijuana program.\n\n\u201cAttitudes have been rapidly evolving and changing. I know that my attitude toward it has also changed,\u201d said Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat. \u201cSeeing the medical benefits and seeing other states implement it ... has convinced me that it\u2019s not the dangerous drug it\u2019s made out to be.\u201d\n\nWith all its success, the U.S. marijuana industry continues to be undercut by a robust black market and federal law that treats marijuana as a controlled substance like heroin. Financial institutions are skittish about cannabis businesses, even in U.S. states where they are legal, and investors until recently have been reluctant to put their money behind pot.\n\nMarijuana businesses can\u2019t deduct their business expenses on their federal taxes and face huge challenges getting insurance and finding real estate for their brick-and-mortar operations.\n\n\u201cUntil you have complete federal legalization, you\u2019re going to be living with that structure,\u201d said Marc Press, a New Jersey attorney who advises cannabis businesses.\n\nAt the start of the year, the industry was chilled when then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded a policy shielding state-licensed medical marijuana operators from federal drug prosecutions. Ultimately the move had minimal impact because federal prosecutors showed little interest in going after legal operators.\n\nSessions, a staunch marijuana opponent, later lost his job while President Donald Trump said he was inclined to support an effort by U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, to relax the federal prohibition.\n\nIn November, Democrats won control of the U.S. House and want to use it next year to pass legislation that eases federal restrictions on the legal marijuana industry without removing it from the controlled substances list.\n\nGardner and Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren have proposed legislation allowing state-approved commercial cannabis activity under federal law. The bill also would let states and Indian tribes determine how best to regulate marijuana commerce within their boundaries without fear of federal intervention.\n\nIf those provisions become law, they could open up banking for the marijuana industry nationwide and make it easier for cannabis companies to secure capital.\n\nBlumenauer\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d to legalize marijuana also calls for the federal government to provide medical marijuana for veterans, more equitable taxation for marijuana businesses and rolling back federal prohibitions on marijuana research, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe have elected the most pro-cannabis Congress in history and more important, some of the people who were roadblocks to our work ... are gone,\u201d Blumenauer said. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to jump-start it in the House, I think there will be support in the Senate, particularly if we deal with things that are important, like veterans\u2019 access and banking.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Japan to Leave International Whaling Commission; Resume Commercial Whaling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-to-leave-international-whaling-commission-resume-commercial-whaling/4717431.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Japan will withdraw from the International Whaling Commission and resume commercial whaling in July.

Not to fight \u2014 not yet, at least \u2014 but to help the men and women who do.\n\nThese robots aren't taking up arms, but the companies making them have waged a different kind of battle. At stake is a contract worth almost half a billion dollars for 3,000 backpack-sized robots that can defuse bombs and scout enemy positions. Competition for the work has spilled over into Congress and federal court.\n\nThe project and others like it could someday help troops \u201clook around the corner, over the next hillside and let the robot be in harm's way and let the robot get shot,\u201d said Paul Scharre, a military technology expert at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe big fight over small robots opens a window into the intersection of technology and national defense and shows how fear that China could surpass the U.S. drives even small tech startups to play geopolitics to outmaneuver rivals. It also raises questions about whether defense technology should be sourced solely to American companies to avoid the risk of tampering by foreign adversaries.\n\nRegardless of which companies prevail, the competition foreshadows a future in which robots, which are already familiar military tools, become even more common. The Army's immediate plans alone envision a new fleet of 5,000 ground robots of varying sizes and levels of autonomy. The Marines, Navy and Air Force are making similar investments.\n\n\u201cMy personal estimate is that robots will play a significant role in combat inside of a decade or a decade and a half,\u201d the chief of the Army, Gen. Mark Milley, said in May at a Senate hearing where he appealed for more money to modernize the force.\n\nMilley warned that adversaries like China and Russia \u201care investing heavily and very quickly\u201d in the use of aerial, sea and ground robots. And now, he added, \u201cwe are doing the same.\u201d\n\nSuch a shift will be a \u201chuge game-changer for combat,\u201d said Scharre, who credits Milley's leadership for the push.\n\nThe promise of such big Pentagon investments in robotics has been a boon for U.S. defense contractors and technology startups. But the situation is murkier for firms with foreign ties.\n\nConcerns that popular commercial drones made by Chinese company DJI could be vulnerable to spying led the Army to ban their use by soldiers in 2017. And in August, the Pentagon published a report that said China is conducting espionage to acquire foreign military technologies \u2014 sometimes by using students or researchers as \u201cprocurement agents and intermediaries.\u201d At a December defense expo in Egypt, some U.S. firms spotted what they viewed as Chinese knock-offs of their robots.\n\nThe China fears came to a head in a bitter competition between Israeli firm Roboteam and Massachusetts-based Endeavor Robotics over a series of major contracts to build the Army's next generation of ground robots. Those machines will be designed to be smarter and easier to deploy than the remote-controlled rovers that have helped troops disable bombs for more than 15 years.\n\nThe biggest contract \u2014 worth $429 million \u2014 calls for mass producing 25-pound robots that are light, easily maneuverable and can be \u201ccarried by infantry for long distances without taxing the soldier,\u201d said Bryan McVeigh, project manager for force projection at the Army's research and contracting center in Warren, Michigan.\n\nOther bulkier prototypes are tank-sized unmanned supply vehicles that have been tested in recent weeks in the rough and wintry terrain outside Fort Drum, New York.\n\nA third $100 million contract \u2014 won by Endeavor in late 2017 \u2014 is for a midsized reconnaissance and bomb-disabling robot nicknamed the Centaur.\n\nThe competition escalated into a legal fight when Roboteam accused Endeavor, a spinoff of iRobot, which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners, of dooming its prospects for those contracts by hiring a lobbying firm that spread false information to politicians about the Israeli firm's Chinese investors.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Roboteam's lawsuit in April.\n\n\u201cThey alleged that we had somehow defamed them,\u201d said Endeavor CEO Sean Bielat, a former Marine who twice ran for Congress as a Republican. \u201cWhat we had done was taken publicly available documents and presented them to members of Congress because we think there's a reason to be concerned about Chinese influence on defense technologies.\u201d\n\nThe lobbying firm, Boston-based Sachem Strategies, circulated a memo to members of the House Armed Services Committee. Taking up Endeavor's cause was Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat \u2014 and, like Bielat, a Marine veteran \u2014 who wrote a letter to a top military official in December 2016 urging the Army to \u201cexamine the evidence of Chinese influence\u201d before awarding the robot contracts.\n\nSix other lawmakers later raised similar concerns.\n\nRoboteam CEO Elad Levy declined to comment on the dispute but said the firm is still \u201cworking very closely with U.S. forces,\u201d including the Air Force, and other countries. But it's no longer in the running for the lucrative Army opportunities.\n\nEndeavor is. Looking something like a miniature forklift on tank treads, its prototype called the Scorpion has been zipping around a test track behind an office park in a Boston suburb.\n\nThe only other finalist is just 20 miles away at the former Massachusetts headquarters of Foster-Miller, now a part of British defense contractor Qinetiq. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The contract is expected to be awarded in early 2019.\n\nBoth Endeavor and Qinetiq have strong track records with the U.S. military, having supplied it with its earlier generation of ground robots such as Endeavor's Packbot and Qinetiq's Talon and Dragon Runner.\n\nAfter hiding the Scorpion behind a shroud at a recent Army conference, Bielat and engineers at Endeavor showed it for the first time publicly to The Associated Press in November. Using a touchscreen controller that taps into the machine's multiple cameras, an engineer navigated it through tunnels, over a playground-like structure and through an icy pool of water, and used its grabber to pick up objects.\n\nIt's a smaller version of its predecessor, the Packbot, which was first used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2002 and later became one of soldiers' essential tools for safely disabling improvised explosives in Iraq. Bielat said the newer Scorpion and Centaur robots are designed to be easier for the average soldier to use quickly without advanced technical training.\n\n\u201cTheir primary job is to be a rifle squad member,\u201d Bielat said. \u201cThey don't have time to mess with the robot. They're going to demand greater levels of autonomy.\u201d\n\nIt will be a while, however, before any of these robots become fully autonomous. The Defense Department is cautious about developing battlefield machines that make their own decisions. That sets the U.S. apart from efforts by China and Russia to design artificially intelligent warfighting arsenals.\n\nA November report from the Congressional Research Service said that despite the Pentagon's \u201cinsistence\u201d that a human must always be in the loop, the military could soon feel compelled to develop fully autonomous systems if rivals do the same. Or, as with drones, humans will still pull the trigger, but a far-away robot will lob the bombs.\n\nSaid P.W. Singer, a strategist for the New America Foundation think tank: \u201cChina has showed off armed ones. Russia has showed them off. It's coming.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Cybersecurity Law: Vietnam Will Censor Internet, Not Close Websites", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cybersecurity-law-vietnam-will-censor-internet-not-close-websites/4719474.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Expect to get caught if you post anti-government material on the internet in Vietnam or take a phishing trip. From 2019 authorities can build evidence against you from material provided by email services and social media networks including Facebook. Yet the country, mindful of its role in the emerging digital economy, won\u2019t close down websites the way China does.\n\nVietnam has long walked a thin line between a free internet as part of its economic growth and resistance against what market research firm IDC\u2019s country manager Lam Nguyen calls \u201cdigital disasters.\u201d The country is getting testier toward online dissent at the same time.\n\nA draft Cybersecurity Law decree to take effect Jan. 1 after 18 months in the making will help the communist government reach these goals by ordering service providers to do some of its surveillance work.\n\nDespite objections from Google and Facebook, global social media as well as email and e-commerce providers may be asked to store data in Vietnam, according to the Cybersecurity Law. Alternately, they can self-censor, turn over customer profiles and delete certain content, Nguyen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying OK, as an online service provider with Vietnam users, you do collect data about such users and their online activities, but you are letting users use your platform or services for unlawful activities, so please come to the front of the line (so) that we can keep an eye out for you,\u201d said Yee Chung Seck, partner with the Baker McKenzie law firm in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nCatching up in cybersecurity\n\nAccording to a United Nations index, Vietnam ranked 101 out of 165 countries in exposure to cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cVietnam has been historically weak when in it comes to cybersecurity,\u201d cyber intelligence analyst Emilio Iasiello wrote in a commentary for the Cyber Research Databank.\n\nDomestic websites were hit by more than 6,500 malware or phishing attacks in the first eight months of 2018, Viet Nam News reports.\n\nVietnam does not block the websites of foreign internet services that could spread objectionable content. Vietnam, like much of Asia, is trying to develop a digital economy, but unlike China it lacks easy-to-control homegrown alternates to the major Silicon Valley internet firms.\n\n\u201cObviously, the business and user communities are more likely hoping to avoid censorship of the internet outright, due to the growing digital commerce economy and also wanting a platform where freedom of expressions and opinions are allowed,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nA digital economy gives Vietnam an opportunity to resolve \u201cbig issues in its economic development,\u201d the deputy minister of industry and trade was quoted saying in June. The manufacturing-reliant economy has grown 6 to 7 percent per year since 2012.\n\nAbout 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s 92 million people use the internet, with 53 million on social media sites.\n\nProtest from multinational internet content providers\n\nAfter Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly approved the Cybersecurity Law in June, 17 U.S. congressional representatives sent a letter to Google and Facebook. They urged both to avoid storing data in Vietnam, to establish \u201ctransparent guidelines\u201d on content removal and to publish the number of requests for removal.\n\nFacebook, Google and other foreign internet companies said earlier this month via a lobbying group that requirements to localize data would hobble investment and economic growth in Vietnam. The law also requires firms with more than 10,000 local users to set up local representative offices.\n\nFacebook said for this report it \u201cremains committed to its community in Vietnam and in helping Vietnamese businesses grow at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nInternet providers also worry the cybersecurity law gives \u201ctoo much power\u201d to Vietnam\u2019s police ministry and lacks \u201cdue process,\u201d Nguyen said. Authorities, they fear, could \u201cseize customer data\u201d and expose a provider\u2019s users, partners or employees to arrest, which goes against privacy protection policies, he said.\n\n\u200bFear among online activists\n\nVietnam is looking to the cybersecurity law as well to control public criticism of government activity, activist bloggers believe. A string of Vietnamese bloggers was arrested in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAuthorities will be able to collect user names, profiles and data on their friends, media reports and analysts say.\n\n\u201cThis law threatens and further curbs freedom to information, infringes (on) personal privacy, and will be certainly used as a tool to give more power to police force, which violates rights, even on behalf of the court on judging on the use of internet,\u201d Hanoi-based internet blogger and human rights activist Nguyen Lan Thang said.\n\nVietnamese activists leaned heavily on internet media to spread information about what they considered slow government reaction to a mass fish die-off in 2016. They use it now to decry corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Cybersecurity Law will have a huge impact on Vietnam\u2019s dissidents and online activists. It will be a tool to silence dissidents, social commentators, and activists in general,\u201d said Vu Quoc Ngu, a writer in Hanoi and director of the non-profit Defend the Defender.\n\nVu Pham, Michelle Quinn of VOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Instagram 'Back to Normal' After Bug Triggers Temporary Change to Feed", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/instagram-back-to-normal-after-bug-triggers-temporary-change-to-feed/4718651.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook Inc\u2019s photo-sharing social network Instagram said on Thursday it has fixed a bug that led to a temporary change in the appearance of its feed for a large number of users.\n\nThe bug led to a small test being distributed widely, the company said.

That's what makes this deep-freeze target so enticing; it's a preserved relic dating all the way back to our solar system's origin 4.5 billion years ago. No spacecraft has visited anything so primitive.\n\n\n\n\"What could be more exciting than that?\" said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University, part of the New Horizons team.\n\n\n\nLead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, expects the New Year's encounter to be riskier and more difficult than the rendezvous with Pluto: The spacecraft is older, the target is smaller, the flyby is closer and the distance from us is greater.\n\n\n\nNew horizons\n\n\n\nNASA launched the spacecraft in 2006; it's about the size of a baby grand piano. It flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the dwarf planet. With the wildly successful flyby behind them, mission planners won an extension from NASA and set their sights on a destination deep inside the Kuiper Belt. As distant as it is, Pluto is barely in the Kuiper Belt, the so-called Twilight Zone stretching beyond Neptune. Ultima Thule is in the Twilight Zone's heart.\n\n\n\nUltima Thule\n\n\n\nThis Kuiper Belt object was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014. Officially known as 2014 MU69, it got the nickname Ultima Thule in an online vote. In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world. When New Horizons first glimpsed the rocky iceball in August it was just a dot. Good close-up pictures should be available the day after the flyby.\n\nAre we there yet ?\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will make its closest approach in the wee hours of Jan. 1 \u2014 12:33 a.m. EST. The spacecraft will zoom within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Ultima Thule, its seven science instruments going full blast. The coast should be clear: Scientists have yet to find any rings or moons around it that could batter the spacecraft. New Horizons hurtles through space at 31,500 mph (50,700 kph), and even something as minuscule as a grain of rice could demolish it. \"There's some danger and some suspense,\" Stern said at a fall meeting of astronomers. It will take about 10 hours to get confirmation that the spacecraft completed \u2014 and survived \u2014 the encounter.\n\n\n\nPossibly twins\n\n\n\nScientists speculate Ultima Thule could be two objects closely orbiting one another. If a solo act, it's likely 20 miles (32 kilometers) long at most. Envision a baked potato. \"Cucumber, whatever. Pick your favorite vegetable,\" said astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins. It could even be two bodies connected by a neck. If twins, each could be 9 miles to 12 miles (15 kilometers to 20 kilometers) in diameter.\n\n\n\nMapping mission\n\n\n\nScientists will map Ultima Thule every possible way. They anticipate impact craters, possibly also pits and sinkholes, but its surface also could prove to be smooth. As for color, Ultima Thule should be darker than coal, burned by eons of cosmic rays, with a reddish hue. Nothing is certain, though, including its orbit, so big that it takes almost 300 of our Earth years to circle the sun. Scientists say they know just enough about the orbit to intercept it.\n\n\n\nComparing flybys\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will get considerably closer to Ultima Thule than it did to Pluto: 2,220 miles versus 7,770 miles (3,500 kilometers vs. 12,500 kilometers). At the same time, Ultima Thule is 100 times smaller than Pluto and therefore harder to track, making everything more challenging. It took 4 { hours, each way, for flight controllers at Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, to get a message to or from New Horizons at Pluto. Compare that with more than six hours at Ultima Thule.\n\n\n\nWhat's next\n\n\n\nIt will take almost two years for New Horizons to beam back all its data on Ultima Thule. A flyby of an even more distant world could be in the offing in the 2020s, if NASA approves another mission extension and the spacecraft remains healthy. At the very least, the nuclear-powered New Horizons will continue to observe objects from afar, as it pushes deeper into the Kuiper Belt. There are countless objects out there, waiting to be explored."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Source: Foxconn to Begin Assembling Top-End Apple iPhones in India in 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/foxconn-to-begin-assembling-top-end-apple-iphones-in-india-in-2019-source/4718218.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "Apple Inc will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India through the local unit of Foxconn as early as 2019, the first time the Taiwanese contract manufacturer will have made the product in the country, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nImportantly, Foxconn will be assembling the most expensive models, such as devices in the flagship iPhone X family, the source said, potentially taking Apple's business in India to a new level.\n\nThe work will take place at Foxconn's plant in Sriperumbudur town in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the source, who is not authorized to speak to the media and so declined to be named.\n\nFoxconn, which already makes phones for Xiaomi Corp in India, will invest 25 billion Indian rupees ($356 million) to expand the plant, including investment in iPhone production, Tamil Nadu's Industries Minister M C Sampath told Reuters.\n\nThe investment may create as many as 25,000 jobs, he added. Another source also said Foxconn planned to assemble iPhones in India, in a move that could help both it and Apple to limit the impact of a trade war between the United States and China.\n\nThe Hindu newspaper first reported on Dec. 24 that the Foxconn plant would begin manufacturing various models of the iPhone.

If that goes ahead, it will be one of the biggest recent steps by a major company to secure an additional production base outside of China.\n\nFoxconn has previously admitted the China-U.S. trade spat was its biggest challenge and that its senior executives were making plans to counter the impact.\n\n\"Widening iPhone manufacturing in India through Foxconn will allow Apple to hedge the risk of any new U.S. trade policies,\" said Navkendar Singh, an associate research director at International Data Corporation.\n\nIndian taxes on import of devices and components have also heightened Apple's headache in a market where it has only a 1 percent share by smartphone shipments.\n\nMaking more phones locally will help Apple save costly duties and boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship drive to make India a manufacturing hub, Singh said.\n\nApple shocked investors last month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.\n\nFoxconn has previously expressed concern over demand for Apple's flagship devices."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Amos Oz, Israeli Author, Dead At 79", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amos-oz-dead-cancer-author_us_5c264bd5e4b08aaf7a900acc", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli author Amos Oz, one of the country\u2019s pre-eminent and widely acclaimed writers, died on Friday after a battle with cancer, his family announced.

Many states are hurrying to pass sports betting laws next year.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., councilman was in a hurry. As the city council prepared to pass a bill this month legalizing betting on sports, Jack Evans was eyeing states just across the city\u2019s borders \u2014 Maryland and Virginia \u2014 that could prove stiff competition unless D.C. got established first.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to get our legislation and our sports gambling up and running so we can be the first in our region and hopefully capture some of the market,\u201d Evans said just prior to the bill\u2019s 11-2 passage last week.\n\nThe council also adopted an emergency measure that allows sports betting to begin as soon as Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser signs the bill, skipping the review period during which Congress can veto a new D.C. law.\n\nThe race to collect bettors\u2019 cash continues as another 20 or so states are poised during their 2019 legislative sessions to approve sports betting. They\u2019re encouraged by some estimates that taxes on legal sports betting could add millions of dollars for their treasuries, though experts urge caution in anticipating that kind of revenue.\n\nSeven states have kicked off sports betting since May 14, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had effectively banned betting on professional and collegiate sports except in Nevada.\n\nDelaware acted first, authorizing betting to begin June 5 (the governor made the first wager, on a Phillies baseball game, and won.). New Jersey followed, June 14. Mississippi, West Virginia (another jurisdiction that competes with nearby D.C.), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New Mexico also quickly legalized sports betting.\n\nStates on the cusp \u2014 where sports legislation was pre-filed or lawmakers have indicated their intention to do so \u2014 will begin to consider legislation in January. In addition to Maryland and Virginia, they are Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress is looking at regulating sports betting. New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer and Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch this month introduced a bill that would set minimum standards for states offering sports betting. It would require states to use the data \u2014 such as point spreads and betting odds \u2014 provided by the sports leagues.\n\nThe states that have legalized sports betting have their own criteria for data, including allowing leagues to provide it.\n\nThe federal bill does not include an \u201cintegrity fee,\u201d or a cut of the gambling revenue, for sports leagues. The leagues have successfully pushed to include that fee in some of the state measures.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., sports wagering would be available at venues such as Nationals Park and Capital One Arena, home to the city\u2019s professional baseball, basketball and hockey teams.\n\nBettors also would be able to wager at restaurants and liquor stores that purchase a license, or by mobile app within the confines of the city. The D.C. Lottery would oversee the industry, ensuring operators obtain licenses and enforcing rules such as the minimum age requirement, which is 18.\n\nThe betting is expected to raise $92 million in revenue over the next four years, according to the city\u2019s chief financial officer. Anticipating the money, the city has designated portions of it for early childhood education and gambling addiction treatment.\n\nMost other states also are dreaming of dollar signs. The American Sports Betting Coalition, an industry group, estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150 billion a year on sports contests. Experts suggest that legal sports betting will cut into \u2014 but not eliminate \u2014 illegal wagering.\n\nPennsylvania reported this month that in the first two weeks of sports betting, bettors wagered $1.4 million, generating $500,000 for the casinos and other gambling sites and about $180,000 in state taxes.\n\nIn New Jersey, sports bettors wagered $330 million in November, generating $21.2 million for the casinos and other betting venues and $2.45 million in state taxes that month, the state treasurer reported.\n\nSports betting was so popular on the first weekend it became available in Rhode Island this month that the state\u2019s Senate president told reporters that he was concerned that the long lines stopped people from placing bets on the earliest Sunday football games. Casino officials said they will be adding terminals and self-service kiosks to shorten the lines.\n\nAn overly optimistic bet?\n\nStates should many factors before estimating sports betting revenue, experts said. For example, betting on sports could eat into revenue from other forms of gambling, including lotteries.\n\nAnd the revenue might prove fickle, said Lucy Dadayan, a senior research associate and an expert on all types of state-sanctioned gambling at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\n\n\u201cSports betting would certainly bring in additional revenue for the states in the short run,\u201d she wrote in an email to Stateline. \u201cHowever, that revenue is likely to have the same fate as the revenue from other types of gambling: volatile, unreliable, unsustainable and likely at the expense of lottery revenues.\u201d\n\nShe noted that New Jersey, where sports wagering has been legal for six months, already has shown ups and downs, dropping significantly from September to October but then rebounding in November.\n\n\u201cI think states are being highly optimistic in their revenue forecasts for sports betting,\u201d Dadayan wrote. \u201cThe early adopter states would certainly see revenue gains in the short run.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only a matter of time until legalized sports betting spreads across the nation, and creates inter-state competition, eventually leading to declines in overall revenues from sports betting,\u201d she added.\n\nIf states want to compete successfully with the illegal sports gambling market, they need to carefully structure their taxes and regulations, said Chris Grove, managing director at Eilers and Krejcik Gaming, an industry analysis group in California.\n\n\u201cOnce your total tax rate starts to drift above 20 percent, you are hampering the ability of operators to invest in marketing and products,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you do that, it\u2019s more difficult for them to compete with illegal operators.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. measure calls for taxes of 10 or 20 percent of gross wagering revenue, depending on whether the bets are made in person or online.\n\nPennsylvania has a total tax rate of 36 percent on sports betting revenue, while West Virginia (10 percent), Mississippi (12 percent) and New Jersey (8.5 to 14.25 percent depending on location) are well below that line. Some states would allot some of the tax revenue to local governments."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Dementia Care Is A Lucrative Business.

Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind the assisted living facility in 2016.\n\nBy Jordan Rau\n\nThey found Bonnie Walker\u2019s body floating in a pond behind her assisted living facility in South Carolina. There were puncture wounds on her ear, temple, jaw and cheeks.\n\nBut her right forearm and pacemaker were missing. Later, they were found inside one of the alligators in the pond.\n\nLike 4 in 10 residents in assisted living facilities, Walker, 90, had dementia. Shortly after midnight one day in July 2016, she slipped out of her facility, Brookdale Charleston, as she had done a few days before. This time, no one noticed her missing for seven hours.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to pass away that way,\u201d her granddaughter Stephanie Weaver said.\n\nAssisted living facilities were originally designed for people who were largely independent but required help bathing, eating or with other daily tasks. Unlike nursing homes, the facilities generally do not provide skilled medical care or therapy, and stays are not paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nDementia care is the fastest-growing segment of assisted living. An increasing number of residences are built to cater to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia. But across the country, many of them are also struggling to deliver on their promises of security and attentive care, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of inspection records in the three most populous states.\n\nIn California, 45 percent of assisted living facilities have violated one or more state dementia regulations during the past five years. Three of the 12 most common California citations in 2017 were related to dementia care.\n\nIn Florida, one in 11 assisted living facilities have been cited since 2013 for not meeting state rules designed to prevent residents from wandering away.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A sign near the pond behind Brookdale Charleston, an assisted living facility in South Carolina, warns about the potential risk of alligators.\n\nAnd in Texas, nearly a quarter of the facilities that accept residents with Alzheimer\u2019s have violated one or more state rules, such as creating a plan of care for each resident with dementia upon admission or ensuring that staff members have completed special training, according to nearly six years of records.\n\n\u201cThere is a belief in our office that many facilities do not staff to the level\u201d necessary to meet the unanticipated \u201cneeds of residents, especially medical needs,\u201d said Fred Steele, Oregon\u2019s long-term care ombudsman. \u201cMany of these are for-profit entities. They are setting staffing ratios that maybe aren\u2019t being set because of the care needs of the residents but are more about the bottom line of their profits.\u201d\n\nUneven regulation\n\nThese concerns, though particularly acute for people with dementia, apply to all assisted living residents. They are older and frailer than assisted living residents were a generation ago. Within a year, one in five experience a fall, one in eight visit an emergency room and one in 12 have an overnight hospital stay, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Half are 85 or older.\n\n\u201cAssisted living was created to be an alternative to nursing homes, but if you walk into some of the big assisted living facilities, they sure feel like a nursing home,\u201d said Doug Pace, director for mission partnerships with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nYet the rules for assisted living remain looser than for nursing homes. The federal government does not license or oversee assisted living facilities, and some states set tougher rules than others.\n\nThe government does not publish quality measures as it does for nursing homes. Inspections usually are less frequent, and fines are generally far lower than what a nursing home might incur for a similar mistake.\n\nLindsay Schwartz, an associate vice president at the National Center for Assisted Living, an industry group, said facilities often juggle what could be conflicting goals at times, such as ensuring the safety of their residents without overly restricting their movement and the ability to socialize.\n\n\u201cDementia is a difficult disease,\u201d she said. \u201cFreedom of movement is incredibly important for overall health, mind, body and spirit. You can\u2019t keep people in isolation.\u201d\n\nIndustry official say rigid government regulations don\u2019t mesh with the individual approaches that assisted living facilities aspire to create for residents.\n\nBut residents\u2019 families, their lawyers and advocates say the violent behavior of agitated residents and escapes could be avoided if there are regulations to ensure better training and more staffing. Eliza Cantwell, a lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina, said too many facilities were accepting residents they weren\u2019t prepared to adequately care for because they wanted to maximize their income.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the qualified personnel to take care of these people, and they\u2019re taking care of them anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nCantwell is representing Weaver in a suit against Brookdale for emotional distress, which Weaver says came from being among the first people to discover her grandmother\u2019s body. Brookdale has already settled a wrongful-death claim from Bonnie Walker\u2019s estate.\n\nThe company declined to discuss Weaver\u2019s lawsuit and said in a statement that \u201cour everyday focus and priority is to keep residents safe.\u201d Brookdale called Walker\u2019s death \u201can unfortunate accident\u201d and said it has retrained its staff.\n\nA year after Walker\u2019s death, after four inspections, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale for 11 violations, including not properly performing night checks and letting staffing drop below required levels. The penalty: $6,400.\n\n\u201cI worked as a law enforcement agent for the Department of Natural Resources, and I\u2019ve written wildlife tickets larger than what DHEC did,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThis was nothing.\u201d\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN Stephanie Weaver holds a photo of her grandmother, Bonnie Walker. Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind her assisted living facility in 2016.\n\n\u2018Get him away from me\u2019\n\nNearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s 30,000 assisted living facilities either house only people with dementia or have special areas known as memory care units. These wings have locked doors and other safeguards to prevent residents from leaving. The facilities often train staff members in techniques to manage behavior related to these diseases and provide activities to keep the residents engaged and stimulated.\n\nThese units usually are more expensive, with monthly costs averaging $6,472, compared with $4,835 for regular assisted living, according to a survey by the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, a group that analyzes elder care market trends. Senior housing investors earned nearly 15 percent in annual returns over the past five years, higher than for apartment, hotel, office and retail properties, according to the center. Beth Burnham Mace, chief economist at the center, said memory care unit construction was outpacing all other types of senior housing.\n\nAggressive behavior, a hallmark of dementia, is a major problem in assisted living facilities. One national study, published in 2016, found that 8 percent of assisted living residents were physically aggressive or abusive toward other residents or staff.\n\nIn the dementia unit of The Point at Rockridge, an assisted living facility in Oakland, California, a resident identified in court papers as Ian began to follow another resident, Olivia Deloney, an 88-year-old with dementia. Before retiring, she had been dean of students at a school for the blind.\n\n\u201cThat man is crazy,\u201d one employee recalled Deloney saying, according to the employee\u2019s sworn statement. \u201cGet him away from me.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, Ian grabbed Deloney and threw her to the ground, breaking her right hip, a video shows. When paramedics were putting her into a stretcher, Ian tried to kick her, and the emergency workers had to keep him away, the police report said.\n\nAfterward, the administrators told Deloney\u2019s daughter, Simone Stevens, that they had not known that Ian, a retired university facilities engineer, was dangerous, her lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cThey just made it sound like it was like a freak accident: \u2018He\u2019s really just a calm and likable resident,\u2019\u201d Stevens said in an interview.\n\nA state investigation report said The Point had been trying to address his behavioral problems before the attack. State regulators declined to punish The Point, saying in their report that there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence that the facility had \u201cclear knowledge\u201d Ian would be a danger to other residents.\n\nBut when Stevens sued The Point, her lawyer, Felicia Curran, discovered that Ian\u2019s agitated behavior, including pushing and shoving, had been the reason his wife initially placed him there. At The Point, he had punched one aide in the shoulders, grabbed another by the neck and jumped on a third and beaten her, employees said in statements taken by Curran.\n\n\u201cIt was an everyday thing for him to chase staff and be physically aggressive,\u201d one declared. Aides posted a photo of him in their kitchen, warning colleagues to watch out for his violent outbursts, and employees once locked themselves in bathrooms for protection, according to records in the case.\n\n\u201cThey should have never had him there in the first place,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A year after Bonnie Walker\u2019s death in 2016, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale $6,400 for 11 violations.\n\nTracee DeGrande, the president of Integral Senior Living, which owns The Point, wrote in a statement that the episode was not typical. \u201cOur staff associates work hard to care for residents, many of whom would have nowhere to go if we didn\u2019t provide a place for those living with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAfter the attack, The Point evicted Ian. Deloney returned to the facility, but, less stable after surgery, she fell and broke her hip again. She stopped eating and died that December, according to her family\u2019s lawsuit, which blamed The Point for not increasing supervision in light of Deloney\u2019s weakened state.\n\nThe Point paid $1.9 million to settle the case. DeGrande wrote that the \u201csettlement was in no way an admission of responsibility for what ended up as a difficult and sad situation.\u201d\n\nTo calm agitated residents, some facilities are too reliant on psychotropic drugs, which carry increased risk of strokes, falls and confusion. An in-progress study funded by the National Institutes of Health has discovered that 27 percent of residents with dementia take an antipsychotic medication, and most lack documentation assuring the drugs are justified, said the lead investigator, Sheryl Zimmerman, a health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nZimmerman said such drugs are often not necessary if residents are cared for by experienced aides who can de-escalate troubling behaviors and know techniques that engage and soothe those with dementia. But she said low pay and frequent turnover make that difficult. \u201cThe workforce could be better trained than they are,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nInadequate state oversight?\n\nStaffing and training requirements vary greatly from state to state. A study published in 2016 and led by Paula Carder, a professor at Portland State University, found that only seven states required facilities to have a registered nurse. States required anywhere from two to 30 hours of training for dementia unit workers. A handful of states required no specialized training, according to the study. Carder found that 19 states set minimum staff-to-resident ratios for dementia units, while the others left it to the facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina requires one of the tightest staffing ratios in the nation for dementia units: one worker for every eight residents during the day and evening. But meeting that rule proves challenging for at least one facility, according to a lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, Michele Mullen asserted that Franklin Manor Assisted Living in Youngsville, North Carolina, did not meet the state\u2019s staffing minimums on a third of the days her mother, Claire Murphy, lived there in 2015 and 2016.\n\nShe said she would find her mother with her pants wet with urine all the way down to her knees, according to a deposition she gave in the lawsuit. Mullen said aides had repeatedly misplaced her mother\u2019s walker. She would see her mother holding onto the hallway railing as she tried to get to her room. On New Year\u2019s Day in 2016, her mother fell and was hospitalized for a fractured arm.\n\nGregory Nicoluzakis, the general counsel for Saber Healthcare Group, which owns Franklin Manor, said in an email that Mullen\u2019s allegations were inaccurate. \u201cWe believe it is telling that Ms. Mullen admitted her mother to our facilities on three separate occasions despite having the choice of other providers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDrew Hathaway, an attorney for Mullen, said there were no better alternatives nearby that had memory care units. \u201cThere are not that many facilities in these rural areas,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sad reality.\u201d\n\nFranklin Manor was fined in 2016 for not following doctors\u2019 orders that two residents needed to use walkers. In February, the state cited it for not supervising five residents, all with histories of falling, who had fallen and injured themselves. Nicoluzakis said Franklin Manor was in compliance with state regulations.\n\nMullen ultimately removed her mother from Franklin Manor; Murphy died last December.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018Mom needs to go to the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018Mom needs help with this,\u2019\u201d Mullen recalled in her deposition. \u201cAnd they would look at me and actually say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it?\u2019\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Father Of Guatemalan Boy Who Died In U.S. Custody Heard Rumors They Could Cross Border", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/father-of-guatemalan-boy-who-died-in-us-custody-heard-rumors-they-could-cross-border_us_5c2624a4e4b08aaf7a8fc30c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "GUATEMALA CITY (AP) \u2014 The father of an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy who died in U.S. custody took his son to the border after hearing rumors that parents and their children would be allowed to migrate to the United States and escape the poverty in their homeland, the boy\u2019s stepsister told The Associated Press.\n\nFelipe Gomez Alonzo died Monday at a New Mexico hospital after suffering coughing, vomiting and fever, authorities said. It was the second such death this month. Another Guatemalan child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, died in U.S. custody on Dec. 8. Both deaths are under investigation.\n\n\u201cWe heard rumors that they could pass (into the United States). They said they could pass with the children,\u201d said Catarina Gomez Lucas, the boy\u2019s 21-year-old stepsister, explaining why Felipe and his father, Agustin Gomez, made the dangerous journey.\n\nGomez Lucas would not say who spread the rumors or who transported the father and son to the border from Yalambojoch in Huehuetenango province, a poor community of returnees from Mexico who had fled Guatemala in the bloodiest years of that country\u2019s 1960-1996 civil war. The stepsister spoke to the AP on Wednesday by telephone from Yalambojoch.\n\nThe boy\u2019s death came during an ongoing dispute over border security and with the U.S. government partially shut down over President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence on funding for a longer border wall.\n\nThe Trump administration has long argued smugglers capitalize on vulnerable parents because of \u201cloopholes\u201d in American law, such as anti-trafficking legislation passed in 2008 that effectively prevents the immediate deportations of Central American children.\n\nAfter hearing the rumors, Agustin Gomez thought he should take advantage of \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to fulfill his son\u2019s dreams. He grabbed a few changes of clothing, bought the boy new shoes and left with what money he had, Gomez Lucas said.\n\nCatarina Gomez via AP This Dec, 12, 2018, photo provided by Catarina Gomez on Dec. 27, 2018, shows her half-brother Felipe Gomez Alonzo, 8, near her home in Yalambojoch, Guatemala.\n\nFelipe \u201calways wanted a bicycle,\u201d and in the U.S. he wouldn\u2019t have to endure the poverty and lack of opportunity in Guatemala, she said.\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother, 31-year-old Catarina Alonzo Perez, said she spoke with her son the day before they arrived at the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t sick on the way; he wasn\u2019t sick here,\u201d she said through her stepdaughter in the Mayan language known as Chuj.\n\nBoth Felipe and Jakelin came from rural communities with extreme poverty. Both were taken to the border by their parents and detained by the U.S. Border Patrol before they fell ill.\n\nIt appears Felipe got sick after authorities moved him from El Paso, Texas, to Alamogordo, New Mexico, because of overcrowding.\n\n\u201cHe was very happy to leave\u201d on the voyage, Gomez Lucas said, so the family does not understand what happened.\n\nShe said the family stopped hearing from Felipe\u2019s father on Dec. 18, when he and the boy were detained. On Dec. 25, he called to say the boy had died in a hospital.\n\n\u201cHe told us that (Felipe) was fine all day, that he was playing with other children.

He sold a piece of land to survive, but the money was not enough, so he decided to take out a loan and travel to the United States.\n\nFelipe is survived by five siblings, two from his father\u2019s first marriage and three from his stepmother and father.\n\nThe boy lived with his father\u2019s family in a small wooden house with earthen floors. It lacked basic services. Gomez Lucas said Felipe\u2019s father earned about $6 a day through temporary farm jobs or harvesting coffee, which was not enough to support the family.\n\nAs with Jakelin\u2019s family, Felipe\u2019s relatives now must deal with the death of a child, a debt and their continued worry about the fate of Agustin Gomez.\n\nOscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, confirmed that the father is still detained by the Border Patrol."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Dementia Care Is A Lucrative Business.

Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind the assisted living facility in 2016.\n\nBy Jordan Rau\n\nThey found Bonnie Walker\u2019s body floating in a pond behind her assisted living facility in South Carolina. There were puncture wounds on her ear, temple, jaw and cheeks.\n\nBut her right forearm and pacemaker were missing. Later, they were found inside one of the alligators in the pond.\n\nLike 4 in 10 residents in assisted living facilities, Walker, 90, had dementia. Shortly after midnight one day in July 2016, she slipped out of her facility, Brookdale Charleston, as she had done a few days before. This time, no one noticed her missing for seven hours.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to pass away that way,\u201d her granddaughter Stephanie Weaver said.\n\nAssisted living facilities were originally designed for people who were largely independent but required help bathing, eating or with other daily tasks. Unlike nursing homes, the facilities generally do not provide skilled medical care or therapy, and stays are not paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nDementia care is the fastest-growing segment of assisted living. An increasing number of residences are built to cater to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia. But across the country, many of them are also struggling to deliver on their promises of security and attentive care, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of inspection records in the three most populous states.\n\nIn California, 45 percent of assisted living facilities have violated one or more state dementia regulations during the past five years. Three of the 12 most common California citations in 2017 were related to dementia care.\n\nIn Florida, one in 11 assisted living facilities have been cited since 2013 for not meeting state rules designed to prevent residents from wandering away.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A sign near the pond behind Brookdale Charleston, an assisted living facility in South Carolina, warns about the potential risk of alligators.\n\nAnd in Texas, nearly a quarter of the facilities that accept residents with Alzheimer\u2019s have violated one or more state rules, such as creating a plan of care for each resident with dementia upon admission or ensuring that staff members have completed special training, according to nearly six years of records.\n\n\u201cThere is a belief in our office that many facilities do not staff to the level\u201d necessary to meet the unanticipated \u201cneeds of residents, especially medical needs,\u201d said Fred Steele, Oregon\u2019s long-term care ombudsman. \u201cMany of these are for-profit entities. They are setting staffing ratios that maybe aren\u2019t being set because of the care needs of the residents but are more about the bottom line of their profits.\u201d\n\nUneven regulation\n\nThese concerns, though particularly acute for people with dementia, apply to all assisted living residents. They are older and frailer than assisted living residents were a generation ago. Within a year, one in five experience a fall, one in eight visit an emergency room and one in 12 have an overnight hospital stay, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Half are 85 or older.\n\n\u201cAssisted living was created to be an alternative to nursing homes, but if you walk into some of the big assisted living facilities, they sure feel like a nursing home,\u201d said Doug Pace, director for mission partnerships with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nYet the rules for assisted living remain looser than for nursing homes. The federal government does not license or oversee assisted living facilities, and some states set tougher rules than others.\n\nThe government does not publish quality measures as it does for nursing homes. Inspections usually are less frequent, and fines are generally far lower than what a nursing home might incur for a similar mistake.\n\nLindsay Schwartz, an associate vice president at the National Center for Assisted Living, an industry group, said facilities often juggle what could be conflicting goals at times, such as ensuring the safety of their residents without overly restricting their movement and the ability to socialize.\n\n\u201cDementia is a difficult disease,\u201d she said. \u201cFreedom of movement is incredibly important for overall health, mind, body and spirit. You can\u2019t keep people in isolation.\u201d\n\nIndustry official say rigid government regulations don\u2019t mesh with the individual approaches that assisted living facilities aspire to create for residents.\n\nBut residents\u2019 families, their lawyers and advocates say the violent behavior of agitated residents and escapes could be avoided if there are regulations to ensure better training and more staffing. Eliza Cantwell, a lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina, said too many facilities were accepting residents they weren\u2019t prepared to adequately care for because they wanted to maximize their income.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the qualified personnel to take care of these people, and they\u2019re taking care of them anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nCantwell is representing Weaver in a suit against Brookdale for emotional distress, which Weaver says came from being among the first people to discover her grandmother\u2019s body. Brookdale has already settled a wrongful-death claim from Bonnie Walker\u2019s estate.\n\nThe company declined to discuss Weaver\u2019s lawsuit and said in a statement that \u201cour everyday focus and priority is to keep residents safe.\u201d Brookdale called Walker\u2019s death \u201can unfortunate accident\u201d and said it has retrained its staff.\n\nA year after Walker\u2019s death, after four inspections, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale for 11 violations, including not properly performing night checks and letting staffing drop below required levels. The penalty: $6,400.\n\n\u201cI worked as a law enforcement agent for the Department of Natural Resources, and I\u2019ve written wildlife tickets larger than what DHEC did,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThis was nothing.\u201d\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN Stephanie Weaver holds a photo of her grandmother, Bonnie Walker. Weaver is suing Brookdale Charleston for emotional distress following Walker\u2019s death in a pond behind her assisted living facility in 2016.\n\n\u2018Get him away from me\u2019\n\nNearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s 30,000 assisted living facilities either house only people with dementia or have special areas known as memory care units. These wings have locked doors and other safeguards to prevent residents from leaving. The facilities often train staff members in techniques to manage behavior related to these diseases and provide activities to keep the residents engaged and stimulated.\n\nThese units usually are more expensive, with monthly costs averaging $6,472, compared with $4,835 for regular assisted living, according to a survey by the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, a group that analyzes elder care market trends. Senior housing investors earned nearly 15 percent in annual returns over the past five years, higher than for apartment, hotel, office and retail properties, according to the center. Beth Burnham Mace, chief economist at the center, said memory care unit construction was outpacing all other types of senior housing.\n\nAggressive behavior, a hallmark of dementia, is a major problem in assisted living facilities. One national study, published in 2016, found that 8 percent of assisted living residents were physically aggressive or abusive toward other residents or staff.\n\nIn the dementia unit of The Point at Rockridge, an assisted living facility in Oakland, California, a resident identified in court papers as Ian began to follow another resident, Olivia Deloney, an 88-year-old with dementia. Before retiring, she had been dean of students at a school for the blind.\n\n\u201cThat man is crazy,\u201d one employee recalled Deloney saying, according to the employee\u2019s sworn statement. \u201cGet him away from me.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, Ian grabbed Deloney and threw her to the ground, breaking her right hip, a video shows. When paramedics were putting her into a stretcher, Ian tried to kick her, and the emergency workers had to keep him away, the police report said.\n\nAfterward, the administrators told Deloney\u2019s daughter, Simone Stevens, that they had not known that Ian, a retired university facilities engineer, was dangerous, her lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cThey just made it sound like it was like a freak accident: \u2018He\u2019s really just a calm and likable resident,\u2019\u201d Stevens said in an interview.\n\nA state investigation report said The Point had been trying to address his behavioral problems before the attack. State regulators declined to punish The Point, saying in their report that there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence that the facility had \u201cclear knowledge\u201d Ian would be a danger to other residents.\n\nBut when Stevens sued The Point, her lawyer, Felicia Curran, discovered that Ian\u2019s agitated behavior, including pushing and shoving, had been the reason his wife initially placed him there. At The Point, he had punched one aide in the shoulders, grabbed another by the neck and jumped on a third and beaten her, employees said in statements taken by Curran.\n\n\u201cIt was an everyday thing for him to chase staff and be physically aggressive,\u201d one declared. Aides posted a photo of him in their kitchen, warning colleagues to watch out for his violent outbursts, and employees once locked themselves in bathrooms for protection, according to records in the case.\n\n\u201cThey should have never had him there in the first place,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nLeigh Webber via KHN A year after Bonnie Walker\u2019s death in 2016, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control fined Brookdale $6,400 for 11 violations.\n\nTracee DeGrande, the president of Integral Senior Living, which owns The Point, wrote in a statement that the episode was not typical. \u201cOur staff associates work hard to care for residents, many of whom would have nowhere to go if we didn\u2019t provide a place for those living with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAfter the attack, The Point evicted Ian. Deloney returned to the facility, but, less stable after surgery, she fell and broke her hip again. She stopped eating and died that December, according to her family\u2019s lawsuit, which blamed The Point for not increasing supervision in light of Deloney\u2019s weakened state.\n\nThe Point paid $1.9 million to settle the case. DeGrande wrote that the \u201csettlement was in no way an admission of responsibility for what ended up as a difficult and sad situation.\u201d\n\nTo calm agitated residents, some facilities are too reliant on psychotropic drugs, which carry increased risk of strokes, falls and confusion. An in-progress study funded by the National Institutes of Health has discovered that 27 percent of residents with dementia take an antipsychotic medication, and most lack documentation assuring the drugs are justified, said the lead investigator, Sheryl Zimmerman, a health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nZimmerman said such drugs are often not necessary if residents are cared for by experienced aides who can de-escalate troubling behaviors and know techniques that engage and soothe those with dementia. But she said low pay and frequent turnover make that difficult. \u201cThe workforce could be better trained than they are,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nInadequate state oversight?\n\nStaffing and training requirements vary greatly from state to state. A study published in 2016 and led by Paula Carder, a professor at Portland State University, found that only seven states required facilities to have a registered nurse. States required anywhere from two to 30 hours of training for dementia unit workers. A handful of states required no specialized training, according to the study. Carder found that 19 states set minimum staff-to-resident ratios for dementia units, while the others left it to the facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina requires one of the tightest staffing ratios in the nation for dementia units: one worker for every eight residents during the day and evening. But meeting that rule proves challenging for at least one facility, according to a lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, Michele Mullen asserted that Franklin Manor Assisted Living in Youngsville, North Carolina, did not meet the state\u2019s staffing minimums on a third of the days her mother, Claire Murphy, lived there in 2015 and 2016.\n\nShe said she would find her mother with her pants wet with urine all the way down to her knees, according to a deposition she gave in the lawsuit. Mullen said aides had repeatedly misplaced her mother\u2019s walker. She would see her mother holding onto the hallway railing as she tried to get to her room. On New Year\u2019s Day in 2016, her mother fell and was hospitalized for a fractured arm.\n\nGregory Nicoluzakis, the general counsel for Saber Healthcare Group, which owns Franklin Manor, said in an email that Mullen\u2019s allegations were inaccurate. \u201cWe believe it is telling that Ms. Mullen admitted her mother to our facilities on three separate occasions despite having the choice of other providers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDrew Hathaway, an attorney for Mullen, said there were no better alternatives nearby that had memory care units. \u201cThere are not that many facilities in these rural areas,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sad reality.\u201d\n\nFranklin Manor was fined in 2016 for not following doctors\u2019 orders that two residents needed to use walkers. In February, the state cited it for not supervising five residents, all with histories of falling, who had fallen and injured themselves. Nicoluzakis said Franklin Manor was in compliance with state regulations.\n\nMullen ultimately removed her mother from Franklin Manor; Murphy died last December.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018Mom needs to go to the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018Mom needs help with this,\u2019\u201d Mullen recalled in her deposition. \u201cAnd they would look at me and actually say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it?\u2019\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This Is What It's Like To Watch Someone You Love Die From ALS", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/als-caretaking_us_5c0fed55e4b08bcb27ed3b19", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "In May 2009, my mom came to visit me just before I graduated from law school. My dad and sisters were scheduled to arrive a couple of days later. The day after she arrived, I met her for lunch.\n\nMy mom had been undergoing medical tests for several months because her speech had started to be slurred and several other mysterious symptoms had presented themselves over the past few years. When I asked her if the doctors had discovered the cause of her symptoms, she blurted out, \u201cThe neurologist thinks that I have ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]. I\u2019m scared to die this way. Eventually, I will be unable to speak and eat on my own. ... I will never make it to your wedding.\u201d\n\nI froze in my chair. The words were barely sinking in. The way she looked that day \u2015 her shocking weight loss and the visible despair on her face \u2015 is still etched into my brain.\n\nTo understand how devastating it was for my family when my mom was diagnosed with ALS \u2014 a \u201cprogressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord,\u201d according to the ALS Association \u2014 you need to understand my mom, Sarah. For my whole life, for better or worse, she was not like any of the other mothers I knew. She was one of the few female partners in her D.C. law firm and one of the few moms in a senior position. She embarrassed me by yelling out the chorus of Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex\u201d in front of my friends in elementary school, always arrived late and sometimes demonstrated her New York roots by flipping off cab drivers when taking me to school. She was short but athletic and tough. I can count on one hand the number of times that I saw her cry in my life, and I distinctly remember when I was finally old enough to beat her in a running or swimming contest. The most common expression that we heard from her was, \u201cReilly, you are so full of shit,\u201d which was directed at my dad, typically during a debate about politics. I simply could not believe that someone as seemingly invincible and full of life as my mom was now facing a disease that would kill her in just a matter of years, if not sooner.\n\nMy dad painfully recalled how a callous neurologist gleefully exclaimed, \u2018She has ALS!\u2019 to my parents after he finally determined what was wrong with her.\n\nWhen I found out about my mom\u2019s diagnosis, like most people, I knew virtually nothing about ALS. Weeks before my graduation weekend, my dad had badgered me to let him drive me from my law school in Indiana back to D.C., which seemed ridiculous, given my age. But as he drove my car home, I sobbed the whole way. \u201cKatie, please breathe,\u201d he sporadically reminded me as I read every article I could find on Google about ALS. He explained the details of the agonizing process of elimination they underwent to arrive at the diagnosis. He painfully recalled how a callous neurologist gleefully exclaimed, \u201cShe has ALS!\u201d to my parents after he finally determined what was wrong with her. Dad promised we would figure it out. \u201cThese people clearly don\u2019t know my mom. She will beat this,\u201d I declared.\n\nThe timing of my mom\u2019s diagnosis was lucky, in that I had been recently deferred as an associate at a law firm in New York, which enabled me to move in with my parents. Before I learned about my mom\u2019s ALS, a bad breakup was the most intense heartbreak I had experienced in my life. I was not personally familiar with death at all, as all my grandparents had passed before I was even a year old and I never had a close relationship with anyone who had died.\n\nInitially, my mom didn\u2019t want to share the diagnosis with anyone outside our immediate family and a couple of close family friends. We desperately hoped that it was a mistake. So we kept the news tight, leaking it only to select individuals when my mom felt comfortable. It felt like a weighted blanket of shame. For months, although I understood it wasn\u2019t logical, I firmly believed that she would somehow defeat this terminal illness. We would just hunker down as a family and research, fight and win.\n\nMonths later, when we could no longer hide mom\u2019s symptoms, I strategically began to share her diagnosis with friends. Frequently, the person I told was unaware of what exactly ALS was or what it did to its victims, so I would then detail the way that she was going to die \u2015 losing the ability to speak, eat and eventually breathe as all her muscles slowly atrophied while her cognition remained intact. While I said each word out loud, I felt more and more alone as I realized that no one knew or could really understand what we were facing. Each word physically hurt to say. The conversation would usually end with me saying, \u201cNo, there is no cure,\u201d as friends inquired about our treatment plan.\n\nCourtesy of Katie. C. Reilly Reilly with her parents a few years after she was born.\n\nAs time passed, my mom\u2019s voice became more impaired. Initially, as other people had more and more difficulty understanding her, I became her interpreter. It was a duty I carried out with pride. Despite the overwhelming sadness I was experiencing, I felt that my mom and I were more intimately connected when she was sick than we ever had been before, and to me, my ability to understand her slurred speech and make it clear to others exemplified that. When she finally lost her voice and I was unable to fulfill that role anymore, I felt like a failure. Her despondency at being unable to communicate weighed heavily on me. Her inability to speak isolated her even further. I started to hate the sound of the voice from the machine that she was forced to use to talk for her.\n\nMy mom had bulbar ALS, a type of ALS that affects the muscles in the face, neck and chest and usually progresses faster than limb-onset ALS. After losing her voice, my mom\u2019s ability to breathe and then to swallow were the next casualties of the disease\u2019s continued onslaught. She became increasingly dependent on a breathing machine. There were so many nights when my dad, mom and I sat at the dinner table and my mom would randomly choke or spit up water and it soon became clear that she would need a feeding tube to survive. She continued to lose weight, had trouble breathing and spit uncontrollably.\n\nDespite what was happening to her, she remained the woman I knew and loved, and her personality and spirit continued to shine. One day when a friend came to visit, Mom wrote in a note, \u201cIt\u2019s considered polite in China to spit,\u201d and handed it to her friend shortly after she arrived. At another point during her illness, I went to visit a friend who had rented a house in Nicaragua, where I met an Irishman who I was interested in (and is now my husband). Months later, I decided to return to Nicaragua to see him. I was certain that my parents were clueless about the true intentions of my trip, but before I left for the airport, I saw a note from my mom on my suitcase that read, \u201cWho\u2019s the guy?\u201d with a smiley face. She drove her car until just before she died (which I now recognize was quite dangerous), demonstrating her determination to fight for her independence despite her devastating circumstances.\n\nCourtesy of Matt Mendelsohn My family at my sister's wedding in June 2010. The fact that my mom is in the middle of the family is not surprising, given the matriarch she was.\n\nMy mom\u2019s battle against ALS pervaded and consumed my family\u2019s collective life, particularly for my dad and me, who were her primary caretakers. Our house gradually filled with different foods, nutritional products, dietary supplements and medical equipment related to her disease. We tirelessly consulted doctors and advisers regarding new medications or alternative treatments that might offer her some hope or at least a little relief from her symptoms. Still, every time we adjusted to a new unwanted change, another, larger one followed, and as hopeful as we tried to remain, we gradually began to feel completely beaten down by the disease.\n\nBefore long, my mom\u2019s mood began to change too. The woman who once filled the house with the world\u2019s greatest head-thrown-back laugh was now unrecognizably sullen, depressed and quiet. The silence was ominous.\n\nIn June 2010, approximately a year after I found out about her ALS diagnosis, my mom, now physically unrecognizable from her prior self, attended my sister\u2019s wedding. The following month, she had such difficulty breathing that she ended up in the emergency room, where we learned that she had contracted pneumonia. During her first few days in the ER, we planned to take her home, but we were told by hospital staff that we couldn\u2019t, although I was never given any specific reason. My whole family longed to have her discharged so that she could die surrounded by family in a place that she loved, but tragically, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhen we were given the ultimatum by the doctors at the hospital to authorize a tracheotomy on her or watch her die, we knew the decision had already been made. My mom did not want to live dependent on a tracheostomy tube or a wheelchair until her death finally arrived. And because she had been a healthy and active woman, her death was not quick. Days passed, and though we knew she was going to die, there was nothing we could do but watch her as she slowly \u2015 too slowly \u2015 moved toward the end of her life. At one point we pleaded with members of her palliative care team to give her more morphine, and they eventually did, which eased her pain.\n\nBecause she had been a healthy and active woman, her death was not quick. Days passed, and though we knew she was going to die, there was nothing we could do but watch her as she slowly \u2015 too slowly \u2015 moved toward the end of her life.\n\nAfter my mom had been at the hospital for almost two weeks, my sisters decided to go back to our house for the night, so it was just my dad and me in my mom\u2019s hospital room. At one point I took a nap on the floor. I still remember the black bandeau floor-length summer dress that I was wearing and tried to use as a blanket in the excessively air-conditioned hospital room. Around 2 a.m., I randomly woke up and saw my dad, visibly upset, by my mom\u2019s bed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have long,\u201d he told me. I moved to sit next to her bed so he could take a break, and I held her hand. I watched her face for what I think was an hour until her breaths slowed and then stopped. Sixteen months after she was diagnosed, we lost my mom to ALS.\n\nBecause of the particular brutality of ALS, I have fought to remember my mom as she was before the disease and not what it did to her or how it ultimately took her from our lives. After she died, my dad reminded me, \u201cALS did not define her life, Katie.\u201d He was right. She lived a full life with great professional success and family and friends who adored her. But ALS dictated when and how she died. It ransacked her brain, atrophied her muscles and ravaged her happiness, and it has been difficult for me to remember the good times that existed before the disease changed everything.\n\nALS also took a grave toll on my dad. He was diagnosed with cancer a year and a half after my mom died, and his oncologist explained that the disease was likely hastened by how run-down he was from the emotional and physical demands of caring for her. He completed one round of chemotherapy, but when the cancer returned less than two years later, he died within months \u2015 on my mom\u2019s birthday.\n\nThe combination of my dad\u2019s illness and subsequent death and my approach to how I handled my grief stunted my ability to process my experience with ALS. I grappled with the guilt that accompanied the feeling that I should have done more to help my mom \u2015 even though I know there was nothing else I could have done. I was constantly filled with anger and sadness, and I often felt there wasn\u2019t the space to share the ALS memories that haunted me. I felt pressured to accept my mom\u2019s death, to grieve her less and to move on. So I put my head down, worked longer hours and tried to push through. Over time, I felt that my ALS story was not even worthy of being told.\n\nCourtesy of Katie C. Reilly Reilly's mom doing her famous head-thrown-back laugh on a family vacation in the late 1980s.\n\nMore recently, particularly after the birth of my daughter a year and a half ago, I started to share my experience with my mom and her ALS more frequently. With time, I am learning to not hide from those difficult memories and to slowly accept the changes in me that occurred because I was an ALS caretaker. My grief continues to be a part of my life, but for the first time in many years, moments from my family\u2019s life before ALS are slowly resurfacing. On rare occasions, I can almost hear my mom\u2019s laugh, which was so powerful, it filled any room she was in.\n\nAbout 30,000 Americans are currently battling ALS \u2014 about 0.009 percent of the country\u2019s population. The extreme rarity of ALS and the lack of public knowledge about it isolated my family during my mom\u2019s illness and contributed to my social retreat in its aftermath. I hope that sharing my ALS story will bring awareness to the cruelty of this disease that took my mom\u2019s life and perhaps help others who are serving or have served as caretakers to feel less alone on their ALS journey.\n\nKatie C.

Her fiance noticed her yellow eyes and freaked out. And that\u2019s how Haynes knew she had caught the disease so many of her friends already had: hepatitis A.\n\nHepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable disease that attacks the liver and is spread by contaminated fecal matter, is a scourge in developing nations with poor sanitation systems. Imported contaminated food is typically to blame when the disease occurs in developed countries.\n\nBut U.S. cases of the disease have tripled in 2018, and the outbreak has nothing to do with imported food.\n\nHepatitis A is spreading among drug-using and homeless populations, with explosions of the disease moving from California to states such as Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nThe toll has been vast: At least 10,582 people have been reported infected so far this year alone, a large number of whom have required extensive \u2014 and thus expensive \u2014 hospitalizations. Hepatitis A inflicts what feel like severe flu symptoms: nausea, fever, dizziness, overall lethargy and jaundice. Without treatment, severe cases of hepatitis A can cause liver failure. At least 80 people have died from this outbreak.\n\nStates, counties and cities have spent millions to fight their local outbreaks, but the money doesn\u2019t address the root causes of the problem: a decaying public health infrastructure, devastated by years of funding cuts, that can\u2019t fully meet the needs of a population driven to homelessness and devastated by the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I see this hepatitis A outbreak as a symptom of the fraying social safety net,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Charleston and surrounding Kanawha County have been a hotbed of West Virginia's hepatitis A outbreak.\n\n\u2018A New Normal\u2019\n\nBefore 1995, when the hepatitis A vaccine was first licensed in the U.S., about 21,000 Americans were diagnosed with hepatitis A each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2006, the CDC recommended all children be vaccinated, and many states now require that children get the vaccine before attending school.\n\nThe release of the vaccine and the spread of immunization caused the number of new cases of the disease to plummet. For the first two decades after the arrival of the vaccine, most outbreaks of hepatitis A in the U.S. were connected to imported contaminated food sources \u2014 like the 2016 outbreak due to frozen strawberries or the 2013 outbreak from pomegranate seeds. On a much smaller scale, the U.S. has also previously seen surges in cases among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.\n\nSo when San Diego County in California saw a spike in hepatitis A cases starting in late 2016 and there didn\u2019t appear to be an underlying food source, the county was caught by surprise. The county health department discovered the disease was spreading through unsanitary living conditions in tent cities and among drug users who were too old to have been vaccinated before attending school. During the peak of the outbreak that fall, the county sprayed its streets with bleach. The health department launched a massive vaccination campaign, added hand-washing stations and new bathrooms, and handed out human poop bags that people could use to dispose of their waste if they didn\u2019t have regular access to a bathroom.\n\nBy the time San Diego quelled the outbreak at the start of 2018, nearly 600 people had been infected and 20 had died. It was just the beginning.\n\nThe San Diego strain of hepatitis A began to pop up nationwide at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, in Utah and then in Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia. Michigan saw an explosion of a different strain of the disease.\n\nIndiana soon took the drastic step of issuing a travel advisory, suggesting that its residents get vaccinated this spring before heading to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby because of the growing outbreak there.\n\n\u201cDisease doesn\u2019t recognize borders when there are outbreaks in neighboring states,\u201d said Pam Pontones, Indiana\u2019s deputy state health commissioner and state epidemiologist.\n\nAs it continued to move east, the disease spread primarily through the drug-using population. Unsanitary and sometimes transient conditions associated with drug use put that population at risk for exposure to contaminated fecal matter, health departments say. There is also some evidence to suggest a possible connection between the disease and intravenous drug use, according to Dr. Sapna Bamrah Morris, who helps lead the CDC\u2019s response to hepatitis A.\n\n\u201cThese are all the symptoms of the cost and human toll the opioid epidemic is taking,\u201d Rahul Gupta, who was head of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources until November, told HuffPost in September. \u201cIt\u2019s much more a telltale sign of the times we\u2019re in and the large epidemic, the tsunami of communicable disease that can happen.\u201d\n\nWhat made these outbreaks difficult to stop, public health officials say, is that they were hurting the people who are hardest to reach: those who are homeless, transient or using drugs, and who don\u2019t trust the health care system after years of stigmatization.\n\nIf these large hepatitis A outbreaks were happening, for example, on college campuses, you\u2019d probably see a different level of energy around getting resources mobilized to respond to them more comprehensively. Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle\n\nPublic health departments had to partner with homeless shelters, soup kitchens and needle exchanges to find these cases of hepatitis A. They set up vaccine drives, deployed strike forces of nurses and staff across cities, sent out mobile vaccine units to far away rural areas. That all takes time and money and effort \u2014 and the disease is still spreading.\n\n\u201cReaching the at-risk populations that are currently affected is extremely resource intensive and everyone has limitations on the resources they have,\u201d said Morris from the CDC.\n\nHealth departments also have \u201ccompeting priorities,\u201d she said, like the onslaught of the flu season.\n\nDuchin put it a bit more bluntly.\n\n\u201cIf these large hepatitis A outbreaks were happening, for example, on college campuses, you\u2019d probably see a different level of energy around getting resources mobilized to respond to them more comprehensively,\u201d he said.\n\nThe entire outbreak demonstrates how public health is failing people most in need of protection, said Jeffrey Howard, the commissioner of Kentucky\u2019s public health department. When the CDC finally issued an advisory to health departments nationwide in June, cases were nearing 2,000 for the year. Now there are closing in on 11,000.\n\n\u201cIt is always clear that inequities and disparities in health and health outcomes exist \u2014 and they exist across this country,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe have to do a better job of protecting that vulnerable population and I think that\u2019s the responsibility of all of public health.\u201d\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Brenda Parker, who works for West Virginia Health Right, sets up a sign advertising free hepatitis A vaccines as part of a mobile clinic that travels to rural areas around the state.\n\nYet all the while, hepatitis A has continued to spread despite health departments\u2019 efforts. And the problem gets worse as those outbreaks move from urban centers to more rural areas that have less public health infrastructure, Howard said. Kentucky and West Virginia have seen such a pattern and have the worst outbreaks to date with 3,265 cases and 2,137 cases, respectively. They\u2019re still seeing new cases every week.\n\n\u201cMy guess is we\u2019re going to see a new status quo with hepatitis A,\u201d Howard said. \u201cHepatitis A is not going to be as rare a disease as it used to be in this country. It\u2019s probably going to be a new normal.\u201d\n\nDecaying Infrastructure\n\n\u201cAs funding cuts happen all along over years, it\u2019s really the public health infrastructure that erodes,\u201d said Lilly Kan, the senior director for infectious disease and informatics at NACCHO. \u201cIt continues to be a smoldering issue, but then when you have fires like outbreaks like hepatitis A, then it becomes obvious.\u201d\n\nNowhere were the consequences of public health cuts more evident than in West Virginia, where Haynes contracted hepatitis A. The state instituted a 24 percent cut in state aid to public health departments in 2016, and several leadership positions remained unfilled as the outbreak spread across the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to manage, and counties that don\u2019t have our resources cannot,\u201d said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, the physician director at the Cabell-Huntington Health Department. \u201cThe state is overtaxed and is relying on the CDC.\u201d But the CDC, which has competing priorities and a limited budget, can only do so much.\n\nKilkenny told WV Public Radio in 2016 that funding cuts \u201cwould really cripple\u201d surveillance efforts for all sorts of diseases.\n\n\u201cIf we stop watching for those diseases, those diseases will spread, people will get sick and some of those people will die,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Dr. Michael Kilkenny, physician director for the Cabell-Huntington Health Department in West Virginia, has decried cuts to public health funding for years.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s hepatitis A outbreak is now the second-worst in the country. Twelve of the more than 2,000 West Virginians who have been diagnosed with the disease this year have died.\n\nHealth departments across the state have lost key staff; the state currently has an interim commissioner of public health. The staffing issues are particularly dire in Kanawha County-Charleston \u2015 the heart of the outbreak, with 782 cases to date. The chief of clinical services at the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department left this year, as did the chief of administration and the chief of health promotion and wellness, according to the former head of the department. Five administrative assistants were let go due to budget cuts in 2017.\n\nDr. Michael Brumage, the former department head, departed this year amid public backlash over a controversial needle exchange in Charleston that shut down in February. And Brenda Isaac, the president of the county\u2019s health board, resigned in October, saying she had become a \u201clightning rod\u201d in the mayoral race, which was largely a referendum on the needle exchange. The interim head of the city\u2019s public health department is working part-time.\n\n\u201cIt was a really unfortunate set of circumstances that depleted the health department of resources right when they needed it most,\u201d said Brumage, who is now the assistant dean for public health practice and service at the West Virginia University School of Public Health. \u201cEven under the best of circumstances it\u2019s difficult to recruit personnel as funding has been slashed over the years.\u201d\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Dr. Angie Settle leads West Virginia Health Right, which has been instrumental in fighting hepatitis A on the ground in Charleston.\n\nThe Kanawha-Charleston Health Department didn\u2019t move fast enough to combat hepatitis because it was distracted by the fight over the needle exchange, said Dr. Angie Settle, the CEO and executive director of West Virginia Health Right, a free health care clinic in Charleston. The county didn\u2019t ramp up its efforts until new cases were peaking in the summer, added Ellen Allen, the executive director of Covenant House, a day shelter in downtown Charleston. Both organizations have played important roles in fighting the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe requested the health department to come in February, but we felt like we kept it too limited in scope,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe should have gotten our arms around this in the spring.\u201d\n\nHuman Poop Bags\n\nThe primary populations affected by the outbreak \u2014 homeless people and drug users \u2014 are served by Covenant House, which has seen a sharp uptick in people coming through the door as the West Virginia economy has struggled in recent years.\n\nBriana Martin, who manages the needs of people who drop in each day at Covenant House, knows at least 10 people in the day shelter who have been infected. She makes sure to wash her hands after interacting with people who have been exposed to hepatitis A. For those who haven\u2019t been vaccinated against the disease, all it would take to contract hepatitis A would be to shake hands with someone who has it or touch the bathroom door before eating.\n\nThe health department has been handing out bags filled with wipes, a toothbrush, toothpaste, two water bottles, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, gloves, detailed sanitary instructions \u2014 and a poop bag. Over 85 people at Covenant House had received the kits as of September.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Briana Martin, drop-in center manager at Covenant House, shows the bags of hygienic products that are handed out to at-risk populations in Charleston. The green bag is for people to use to clean up their own waste.\n\nBut sanitary problems persist. Allen said her staff often cleans up poop outside the shelter. She has requested more outdoor bathrooms, but nothing has changed \u2014 and the shelter is only open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nIt\u2019s just another sign that things continue to worsen for those without a safety net, according to Allen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in nonprofit work for 11 years now and just the last year the acceleration and the decrease in the well-being of people \u2014 it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nAlmost all of the 20 or so people at Covenant House one afternoon this September said they had heard of hepatitis A. Yellow signs with bold letters urging people to get vaccinated dotted the walls.\n\nHaynes, who asked not to be photographed, was there doing her laundry. A middle-aged man who was visiting the shelter and did not want to be identified said he had a friend who had died after contracting hepatitis A, which complicated his underlying hepatitis B and C. Terrell, a Covenant House visitor who declined to give his last name, sat outside the doors for a few hours before making his way in to tease the staff. But when asked about hepatitis A, he answered quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people about to die of it \u2014 wait till they\u2019re about to die before they go in,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a third-world disease and some shit?\u201d\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost Terrell, who is currently homeless, said he has seen the effects of hepatitis A up close.\n\nThe Damage Done\n\nThe financial costs of these outbreaks have been high, and they\u2019re still rising.\n\nSan Diego County estimates it spent $12.5 million to quell its outbreak, which is one-quarter the size of West Virginia\u2019s. Kentucky has allocated $2 million so far to the vaccine alone, which doesn\u2019t even count federal money. The underlying hospitalization costs are astronomical, which Brumage said ends up affecting both hospitals and taxpayers because so many members of the at-risk populations are uninsured.\n\n\u201cThose are very extensive hospitalizations that itself would be several million,\u201d said Gupta, West Virginia\u2019s former public health commissioner.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even begin to account for the other resources, such as time, that public health departments and community partnerships have put toward battling the outbreaks.\n\nCraig Hudson for HuffPost West Virginia Health Right sponsors mobile clinics that deliver hepatitis A vaccinations and HIV testing to rural areas across the state.\n\nAnd news of an outbreak can devastate a local economy.\n\nPopular fast food restaurants in West Virginia have taken a massive hit, said Tri-State Restaurant Association spokesman Mike Kirtner. The organization was formed after Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia saw hepatitis A cases take off. Hepatitis A cases have shut down several restaurants in the Charleston area this year, and Kirtner said one major chain lost 70 percent of its business in a single day after a case of hepatitis A was reported. Waitresses at affected restaurants have seen their tips decrease, Kirtner said, sometimes from as much as $300 a day to just $50.\n\nBlame Game\n\nPoliticians, local TV news and the public have blamed just about everything except the lack of public health funding for the outbreak in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt all came from restaurants,\u201d Danny Jones, Charleston\u2019s outgoing mayor, told HuffPost.\n\nBut none of the West Virginia cases have been traced to food contamination. However, Kirtner said, restaurant workers, who are at much higher risk for the disease, are disproportionately represented among intravenous drug users.\n\nJones also criticized the health department for the outbreak, saying it \u201ccaught it a little late.\u201d But the real problem, he argued, was a \u201cneedle mill\u201d that attracted undesirable people to Charleston.\n\n\u201cToo many free meals drawing people in,\u201d he said.\n\nRhetoric like that \u2014 the idea that services helping the homeless and drug-using people are destroying Charleston \u2014 is becoming more mainstream.\n\nA private Facebook group called \u201cCharleston Has Had Enough\u201d blames \u201cjunkies, bums, thieves, dangerous people, most from out of state,\u201d for the area\u2019s growing problems and encourages users to \u201cpost your photos of troublemakers.\u201d\n\nFacebook\n\nThe group has more than 4,600 members, which is comparable to about 10 percent of the city\u2019s population. Users post unflattering photos of people who appear to be among the area\u2019s homeless and drug users, and some include racist and homophobic captions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving, but in the meantime, I want to feel safe and I want these nasty creatures to leave my car, porch, home and business alone!\u201d one group member wrote recently.\n\nNext Year\u2019s Cases\n\nThat sort of dehumanization of the people most at risk for hepatitis A will make it difficult for public health providers to fight the disease. But there are a few bright spots, said Morris of the CDC.\n\nShe is heartened by the sharing of information among afflicted states, the raised awareness about the issue among health departments nationwide, and the new recommendations from the CDC\u2019s vaccination advisory panel to make hepatitis A vaccination routine for the homeless \u2014 a public health first.\n\nBut Morris said she\u2019s not sure what next year\u2019s case count could look like.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful we may not see the larger outbreaks that we\u2019re seeing currently, but it is very difficult to predict,\u201d she said.\n\nOther public health experts are more pessimistic.\n\n\u201cThere is a good reason to suspect that this will further spread to other states,\u201d Gupta warned. \u201cThis is not yet over.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "The Violence Against Women Act Just Expired", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-violence-against-women-act-just-expired_us_5c24d8aae4b05c88b6fe046e", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "VAWA, the first federal legislation to recognize and address domestic violence as a serious crime, was created with the help of then-Sen.

Since then, scientists have said, mercury pollution from power plants has declined more than 80 percent nationwide.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s new proposal does not repeal the regulation, known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, but it would lay the groundwork for doing so by weakening a key legal justification for the measure . The long-term impact would be significant: It would weaken the ability of the E.P.A. to impose new regulations in the future by adjusting the way the agency measures the benefits of curbing pollutants, giving less weight to the potential health gains.\n\nIn announcing the proposed rule, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement that the cost of cutting mercury from power plants \u201cdwarfs\u201d the monetary benefits. The proposal, which the acting E.P.A. administrator, Andrew Wheeler, signed on Thursday, is expected to appear in the federal register in the coming weeks.

A study that I wrote about in January, for instance, found that people\u2019s blood contained more of certain vesicles, which are tiny bubbles filled with biological material, after aerobic exercise."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Doctors: What Lies Beneath the Surface", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/well/live/doctor-patient-relationship-psychology-suicide.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 19:02:01", "body_paragraphs": "She shook her head no, and then took a deep breath before answering. \u201cI was raped when I was 13.

And then it all came out.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time patients have told me that having a life-threatening diagnosis like leukemia roused some past demons, or made them see their relationships in a different light. For some, dodging the bullet of leukemia made them cherish their partner and their parents and children even more. For others, with a second lease on life, they realized that they didn\u2019t want to squander the opportunity with someone they really didn\u2019t get along with, and divorce often resulted, or a rift with other relatives.\n\n\u201cWhat an awful thing to happen,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t pick up on it.\u201d I blamed myself for not noticing her sadness. I know that patients often put on their best face for me, and try to see beyond that facade. But I missed it with her.\n\n\u201cHey doc, don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. I didn\u2019t notice it either,\u201d her husband said, taking her hand in his.\n\nShe chuckled. \u201cEven though I was calm on the outside, I was screaming bloody murder on the inside. I kept thinking, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t feel this way. I should feel grateful for being alive two years from my diagnosis, when others aren\u2019t.\u2019 But the feeling wouldn\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you getting help for your depression?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cOh yeah. For a while. When I started counseling, they told me it would feel like they were sticking a knife into my soul and slowly pulling it out. And it did,\u201d she said, shaking her head with the memory.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing now?\u201d I asked, softly.\n\nShe smiled at me and took my hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine now.

The United States Navy recently traded an 18-hour submarine shift schedule for a 24-hour one that more closely matches sailors\u2019 biological rhythms. And at some pharmaceutical, software and financial companies, managers expect employees to come to the office for only a few hours in the middle of the day \u2014 or to work off site entirely.\n\n\u201cI think circadian rhythms will be a huge issue for human resources in the future,\u201d said Camilla Kring, a Danish consultant who has helped employees at AbbVie, Roche, Medtronic and other companies learn to respect their natural sleep cycles. \u201cIt really makes sense to think about when people have the most energy and when they\u2019re peaking mentally.\u201d\n\nWorker fatigue has played a role in many workplace accidents, most famously the Challenger space shuttle explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but no doubt countless more on the commute to and from work. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy drivers cause 16.5 percent of fatal crashes.\n\nA survey released last year by the National Safety Council found that 97 percent of workers have at least one risk factor for fatigue, with 27 percent reporting having unintentionally fallen asleep on the job in the previous month and 16 percent that they had experienced at least one safety incident because of fatigue.\n\n\u201cWe have a 24/7 society, so we knew fatigue was definitely affecting part of our work force,\u201d said Emily Whitcomb, senior program manager of the council\u2019s fatigue initiative. \u201cBut we did not anticipate that fatigue was going to be affecting almost 100 percent of our work force.\u201d\n\nSleep deprivation may even lead to ethical breaches at work. In a 2014 experiment, Christopher Barnes of the University of Washington and colleagues asked 142 people with extreme chronotypes to show up at their laboratory either at 7 a.m. or at midnight for a dice-rolling game that offered a $500 prize. Reporting was on the honor system. Morning people lied 18 percent more when they did the task at midnight than when they did it in the morning, whereas night owls lied 16 percent more when doing the task at 7 a.m.\n\nDr. Roenneberg has collected data from 300,000 people and found that chronotypes plot as a bell-shaped curve, with a few individuals at each extreme and most falling somewhere in the middle. According to Dr. Roenneberg\u2019s research, the most frequent chronotype \u2014 held by about 13 percent of the population \u2014 sleeps from around midnight to 8 a.m. Thirty-one percent of people have an earlier natural bedtime, and 56 percent have a later one. That means for at least 69 percent of the population, getting to the office by 8 or 9 a.m. requires waking up before their body is ready."}]
