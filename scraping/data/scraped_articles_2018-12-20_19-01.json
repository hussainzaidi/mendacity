If Trump cannot secure the $5 billion he is demanding for the wall now, it's unlikely he will see a spending bill that meets his requirement for at least two years as Democrats assume control.\n\nStewing at the White House, Trump ranted on Twitter that he'd been down a similar road earlier this year, only to find himself again in the same position.\n\nHe summoned House Republicans -- who thought they'd struck a deal to avert a shutdown -- for noontime talks at the White House.\n\n\"President Trump just met with Republican Members of the House. Not surprisingly, they all feel strongly about border security -- stopping the flow of drugs, stopping human trafficking and stopping terrorism. We protect nations all over the world, but Democrats are unwilling to protect our nation. We urgently need funding for border security and that includes a wall,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said following the White House meeting.\n\nThe White House is following Office of Budget and Management guidelines on notifying federal employees whether they'll be furloughed in case of a government shutdown, a senior administration told CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\n\"Prudent management requires that agencies be prepared for the possibility of a lapse. OMB guidance states that two business days before a potential lapse, agencies need to notify employees of their work and pay status under a lapse -- that is, if they are furloughed or excepted. Agencies were directed by OMB to start that notification this morning,\" the official said.\n\nThe last-minute scramble came after several days of whiplash, which began last week when Trump said in a meeting with Democrats that he would be proud to oversee a shutdown if it meant securing funds for the wall.\n\nLater, the White House signaled he was softening on that stance, indicating the President was open to a compromise that fell short of providing the $5 billion Trump is demanding.\n\nThat provided an opening for Republican lawmakers to begin proceedings on a measure that would provide funding for nine federal agencies through February. That bill passed the Senate on Wednesday evening.\n\nBut on Thursday morning, the future of that plan was thrust into question after Trump tweeted his frustration at having to swallow another spending measure that doesn't include funds for the wall.\n\nState of play\n\nJUST WATCHED Eyes on Trump as Senate passes funding bill Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Eyes on Trump as Senate passes funding bill 01:17\n\nThe plan making its way through Congress would provide funding through February 8 -- after Democrats assume control of the House, making this the likely last chance Trump will have of securing a plan that provides funds for the wall.\n\n\"When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn't happen!\" he wrote after a phone conversation with House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!\"\n\nTrump remained ambiguous Thursday on whether he will sign a measure temporarily funding the government in order to avoid a year-end shutdown, as he lamented a lack of funding for his desired border wall.\n\nHe is due to depart Friday afternoon for an extended holiday stay at his Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida. The White House has refused to say whether he would still travel there if the shutdown occurs. Included in the federal agencies affected would be the Secret Service, whose agents and officers would still work to protect the President and his family, just on an unpaid basis.\n\nA senior White House official told CNN Friday it's possible that Trump will decide not to back down on the wall fight as a result of growing pressure from the Freedom Caucus and conservatives.\n\nThe official said it's still unclear what Trump will do -- a similar situation to the omnibus signing last March.\n\n\"If Congress can't give the President border wall funding now with Republicans in charge we certainly don't stand a chance with (House Democratic Leader Nancy) Pelosi and the Dems taking over the House next year,\" the official said.\n\nMixed signals\n\nJUST WATCHED Berman calls Trump's bluff about border wall Replay More Videos ...

What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!\" Trump tweeted Thursday, seeming to indicate he would pick up the border wall fight next year after Democrats take control of the House.\n\nWhile the legislation, which passed the Senate Wednesday, is expected to pass the House before the end of the week, many conservatives are calling on the President to oppose the legislation and Trump is listening. But a House Republican leadership news conference was delayed Thursday morning as lawmakers debated how to proceed, lending even more uncertainty to how the issue would get resolved."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Decrying 'illegals,' amputee veteran raises millions for border wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/KbzDAgSa50s/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A triple amputee Air Force veteran and motivational speaker is asking the 63 million Americans who voted for President Donald Trump to chip in $80 apiece for the border wall.\n\nThe total would meet Trump's request for $5 billion to build a wall along the United States' southern border with Mexico, with $40 million to spare. Trump said Wednesday, amid debate over a potential government shutdown, that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall via a trade deal and that the US military would build it.\n\n\"Even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this,\" Brian Kolfage writes on his verified GoFundMe, which had raised more $5 million from about 84,000 donors as of midday Thursday.\n\nMexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA!

The recruit bailed, allowing Kolfage to make the trip, he said.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, after a night of customs enforcement work, Kolfage awoke in the afternoon. Shortly after leaving his tent, he heard a blast that rendered him unconscious. When he came to, he learned a mortar had landed feet away from him, horrifically wounding him.\n\nHis friends would later tell him that while moving him to a stretcher, they had to hold his body parts in place for fear they'd fall off. In the on-base trauma center, the doctors tending to him \"looked like they were scared s***less,\" he told CNN.\n\nHe woke up two weeks later in Ward 57 of Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

Whether or not he will be able to have direct dialogue with Russia as a result of that, I don't know,\" he said.\n\nPutin added that he was concerned by the erosion of the democratic process in the West, including the US. \"Trump has won the election but not everyone is willing to accept this victory despite that it is indisputable truth,\" he said.\n\nNuclear arms race fears\n\nPutin also addressed concerns about the growing risks of a new nuclear arms race as he held his annual televised news conference in Moscow.\n\n\"The danger of the situation escalating is being downplayed,\" he said in response to a question about fears of nuclear war.\n\nPutin expressed the hope that humankind would have enough common sense \"not to go to extremes.\" He also warned that the lowering of thresholds relating to nuclear capability \"could really lead us to catastrophe.\"\n\nRussia has criticized the US over the Trump administration's plans to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, saying it risks the breakdown of international arms-control agreements.\n\nThis year's news conference is Putin's 14th, according to state-run media outlet RT.\n\nThe widely anticipated event, broadcast live on Russian TV, is a chance for hundreds of Russian and international journalists to pose questions on a range of subjects from the purely domestic to global affairs. Many hold up signs and banners as they seek to attract Putin's eye.\n\nThis year's marathon session wrapped after close to four hours, during which Putin appeared unruffled by the many issues raised, trotting out a raft of facts and figures -- and even making the odd humorous remark.\n\nJournalists at Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual end-of-year news conference hold up signs to attract his attention.\n\nUkraine tensions\n\nQuestioned about Russia's detention of Ukrainian sailors in the Kerch Strait off Crimea last month, Putin laid the blame for increased military tensions at the door of the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe Ukrainian servicemen's action was a provocation designed to boost domestic support for President Petro Poroshenko ahead of elections in the country next year, he said.\n\nPutin also pointed the finger at Kiev for the suffering of ordinary citizens in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\n\"Who do you think imposed the economic blockade on Donbas? The Ukrainian government,\" he said. \"They are shooting at their citizens which they believe are Ukrainian citizens. Every day peaceful men and women are dying.\"\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been locked in long-simmering conflict since the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and a war between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the country's east has claimed more than 10,000 lives.\n\nPutin Thursday disputed that Crimea had been annexed, since residents voted in a referendum to leave Ukraine, and argued that sanctions imposed by Western nations against Russia were effectively penalizing the people of Crimea.\n\nMost of the world condemned the 2014 referendum in Crimea -- held after unidentified armed men had taken control of its administrative buildings and key military sites -- as illegitimate.\n\n'Russophobic' mentality over Skripal case\n\nPutin declined to comment on the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury earlier this year.\n\nBut he drew a contrast between the world's reaction to that case and the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.\n\nWhile \"a whole heap of sanctions has been imposed on Russia\" in connection with the Skripals, there has been \"silence\" over the Khashoggi case with regard to Saudi Arabia, he said.\n\nThat is very clearly down to a \"Russophobic\" mentality aimed at containing Russia's development to benefit its competitors, said Putin.\n\nThe UK government has accused Moscow of being behind the nerve agent attack on the Skripals , a claim Russia has consistently denied.\n\nPutin described the Russia-UK relationship as \"gridlocked\" and suggested that could have an effect on the global economy, adding that Russia was interested in restoring its relationship with Britain.\n\nAs for Brexit, it's a domestic affair and the UK government should follow the wishes of the people, Putin said. \"I hope that common sense prevails,\" he said.\n\nPutin returned to the subject of Brexit late in the news conference as he raised concerns over the democratic process in the West.\n\n\"There was a referendum but no one actually wants to acknowledge the results,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "$18,000 settlement in 'nut rage' incident", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/--j7BXI-Rug/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Korean Air has been ordered to pay 20 million South Korean won (almost $18,000) to a flight attendant after he was excoriated by an executive when she was served her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl as their plane prepared to take off.\n\nThe infamous \"nut rage\" incident took place in 2014, when Heather Cho -- vice president of Korean Air at the time and daughter of the company's CEO, Cho Yang-ho -- demanded the plane return to its gate at New York's John F.

But their efforts to start a family have put them at the center of the latest battleground in the religious freedom debate.\n\nThe Michigan couple has been together for 12 years and married for seven. Both women have stable careers and loving families. They want to share their good fortune with children in state foster care with the goal of adopting. They even bought a new home in a good school district and two extra bedrooms in Lansing's suburbs to prepare.\n\nBut when the Dumonts contacted two child welfare agencies in 2016 and 2017 to become certified foster parents, they say the agencies told them they don't work with same-sex couples, citing religious beliefs.\n\n\"They just didn't get to know us at all. It was just one little thing -- that we're two women together -- and that was it,\" Kristy Dumont said.\n\nKristy and Dana Dumont have empty rooms in their home waiting to be filled by children.\n\nMichigan is one of 10 states that allow child welfare agencies to act in accordance with their religious beliefs, even if those beliefs mean refusing to work with same-sex couples. In all but one of those states -- Alabama -- the laws protect organizations that receive taxpayer funds to perform services on the state's behalf, such as screening prospective parents to care for foster children or finding homes for foster children.\n\nSupporters of the laws say they are necessary to ensure that faith-based child welfare agencies can keep their doors open and help children in need. They point out that the laws do not prevent same-sex couples from fostering or adopting through other child welfare agencies, including religious groups that do not object to same-sex relationships.\n\nBut opponents of religious exemptions -- including many child welfare organizations, faith groups and civil rights groups -- call them state-sponsored discrimination. Because research shows that same-sex couples are more likely to be raising adopted or foster children than different-sex couples, critics say the laws hurt children by cutting them off from a pool of prospective parents when need far exceeds demand.\n\n\"What all these laws do at their core is let agencies make placement decisions based on religious beliefs with impunity. And they can't have their license or funding revoked for doing so,\" said attorney Shelbi D. Day with the Family Equality Council , which is part of a coalition that opposes the policies.\n\nKristy and Dana Dumont are challenging the state's practice of letting contractors use religious criteria to screen families.\n\nThe goal of the foster care system is to restore stability to a child's life by finding them a forever home. According to US government data, nearly 438,000 children are in foster care on any given day. On average, children remain in state care for nearly two years.\n\nWhen children can't return to their parents or guardians, states often turn to private agencies for help placing them, including faith-based groups, who have a long tradition of providing child care services as part of their ministries.\n\nAsking faith-based organizations to operate in defiance of their beliefs is effectively asking them to abandon their mission, said Sandy Furnell, spokesman for Miracle Hill Ministries , a Christian nonprofit that provides child welfare services in South Carolina.\n\n\"That's what makes them who they are -- that's what makes them a religious organization,\" she said. \"If they cannot operate according to their religious convictions, then they're no longer operating according to their faith.\"\n\nBattles are playing out across the country\n\nSouth Carolina was one of three states to incorporate religious exemptions measures into its child welfare system in 2018, with Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nMichigan's law took effect in 2015 with the expressed aim of \"having as many possible qualified adoption and foster parent agencies,\" according to the statute's language\n\n\"The more qualified agencies taking part in this process, the greater the likelihood that permanent child placement can be achieved.\"\n\nThe Dumonts and another same-sex couple sued the state of Michigan to end its practice of letting faith-based contractors use religious criteria to screen couples for foster care. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing them in the lawsuit filed in September 2017 against the state Department of Health and Human Services and Children's Services Agency.\n\nThe couples say they don't object to the law itself, just the state's implementation of it as it relates to state contractors.\n\nThe Dumonts started seriously considering fostering children after receiving an email from the state of Michigan.\n\nThe complaint asks the directors of those agencies to forbid state-contracted, taxpayer-funded agencies from disqualifying prospective families based on religious beliefs. They allege that the refusal of faith-based, state-funded child welfare agencies to consider them as prospective parents, based on their sexual orientation, violates their equal protection rights and amounts to the state's endorsement of those religious beliefs.\n\n\"The bigger point is that we now have a system where Christian people get a choice of, say, 100 agencies and everyone else -- not just LGBTQ people -- have to settle for a subset,\" said Leslie Cooper, deputy director of the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project, who is representing the Dumonts.\n\n\"The idea that one group gets fuller choice, and another has to settle for a subset, that's contrary to this country's values and constitutional traditions.\"\n\nTheir lawsuit is playing out against a national backdrop of similar conflicts weighing the rights of faith-based organizations contracted by government agencies -- with varying outcomes. And same-sex couples aren't the only people who are impacted.\n\nEarlier this year, Miracle Hill -- which receives state and federal funding -- turned away a Jewish woman seeking to mentor children in foster care because she did not share the organization's religious beliefs.\n\nMiracle Hill stands by its actions, Furnell said.\n\nIn early 2018, Miracle Hill challenged the state's efforts to prevent it from only recruiting families who \"share its nondenominational Christian religious beliefs.\" Miracle Hill described the Department of Social Services' efforts to enforce its interpretation of federal nondiscrimination laws as a threat to the nonprofit's religious liberty that would force it to end foster care services.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster sided with Miracle Hill and signed an executive order directing the state Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that it does not penalize faith-based agencies for acting on their beliefs.\n\nMcMaster also asked the US Department of Health and Human Services to waive regulations for faith-based child welfare agencies in South Carolina that prevent federally funded child welfare agencies from discriminating based on religion and sexual orientation.\n\nWeeks later, a group of US senators asked HHS to rescind the rule.\n\nMiracle Hill said the governor's action and the state legislative proviso provided it with \"temporary protection for our religious liberty\" while it awaits clarification from HHS on the governor's request. \"Our foster care program is currently operating under a provisional license from the SC Department of Social Services because the state is also awaiting clarification from HHS,\" President and CEO Reid Lehman said.\n\nLawmakers introduced a bill in July that would have let HHS cut 15% of a state's federal funding for child welfare services if the state penalized a child welfare agency for acting on its religious beliefs. Congress passed a funding bill in September that did not include the amendment.\n\nMeanwhile, nine states and the nation's capital have laws that forbid discrimination by foster care agencies and officials. At least one of those policies is under attack in Philadelphia, where a faith-based agency sued the city over its nondiscrimination requirement.\n\nCatholic Social Services lost the suit in July when a federal judge ruled in favor of Philadelphia, saying the state-contracted agency must comply with the city's anti-discrimination law. The agency appealed in July. In August, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\n\n'I didn't expect it to hurt as much as it did'\n\nDana, left, and Kristy Dumont got married in Vermont in 2011.\n\nThe Dumonts met in 2006 and married five years later in Vermont, one of a few states where same-sex marriage was legal at the time. But they never seriously considered becoming parents until same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in 2015.\n\nBefore then, the Dumonts feared the lack of legal protections for LGBTQ Americans could have unforeseeable consequences for their parental rights should anything happen to one of them.\n\nA random email in 2016 from the state Department of Health and Human Services seeking foster parents made the couple consider the idea seriously. They were touched by the children's stories and startled by the scope of need described on the state's website. In Michigan, at the time, there were 13,000 children in foster care and 300 children in need of an adoptive family.\n\nThey did more research and learned the basic truths of foster care. For one, there are always more children in need of placements than available homes. And the more a child bounces from one placement to the next, the less likely it becomes that the child will find a forever home. Meanwhile, the likelihood of developing behavioral problems and low self-esteem grows, which is why older children have a harder time finding placements.\n\nChild welfare experts say that most people want to adopt babies or young children. But the Dumonts want to open their home to older children.\n\nTo prepare, they bought a home in Dimondale near the Grand River with a fenced-in yard. Then, in 2016 and 2017, they called two agencies in Lansing that offered classes for becoming certified foster parents, Bethany Christian Services and St. Vincent Catholic Charities.\n\nThe Dumonts bought a home in a good school district to prepare for children.\n\nThe Dumonts say they chose the two agencies closest to their home that they were eligible to work with. In one call, the person on the other line immediately told them the agency does not work with same-sex couples, they said. A person from the other agency called them back to deliver the news.\n\nKristy Dumont knew in the back of her mind that Michigan had passed religious exemption laws in 2015, she says. \"I guess some part of me thought it wouldn't happen to us. It was hard to have it happen, actually see it in practice.\"\n\nIt was her first time experiencing discrimination firsthand, she said. \"I didn't expect it to hurt as much as it did.\"\n\nThe state's position: Religious freedom opens more homes to children\n\nThe state of Michigan declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the pending litigation. In its motion to dismiss the couples' complaint, it defends the state law, which says the government may not take adverse action against an agency for conduct in accordance with its religious beliefs.\n\n\"If faith-based agencies are not allowed to operate according to their religious principles, they will shut down, which can have the effect of reducing the number of available families. Such a result will do nothing to help a single child find a home,\" the motion says.\n\nThe state argues that the Dumonts are free to work with any other agency in neighboring Ingham County, which has six agencies, conceding that Eaton County where the Dumonts live has none. There are 108 child placing agencies in Michigan, and the Dumonts \"only called two, and (when) they were referred elsewhere they stopped,\" the motion states.\n\nThe state claims that contracting with as many third-party agencies as possible advances secular interests, allowing more services for children to flourish by accommodating faith-based and non-faith-based agencies. But \"the mere receipt of funding\" does not make an agency a state actor, the motion states. Therefore, the state argues, \"Plaintiffs are in effect complaining about the actions of private actors, whom Plaintiffs have not sued, and whose actions are not attributable to Defendants.\"\n\nToys sit in empty bedrooms in the Dumonts' home.\n\nBethany Christian Services declined to comment for this story, citing pending litigation. St. Vincent Catholic Charities asked to join the lawsuit to represent its interests.\n\nSt. Vincent is not opposed to placing children with same-sex couples, said lawyer Mark Rienzi. It's the home study and licensing that infringes on the agency's religious beliefs by requiring staff to visit a prospective family's home and evaluate their relationship.\n\n\"As a Catholic organization, St. Vincent cannot provide a written recommendation to the State evaluating and endorsing a family situation that would conflict with its religious beliefs,\" said Lori Windham, Rienzi's co-counsel from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty\n\n\"Placing a child with a family that is already certified by another agency, however, does not require St. Vincent to evaluate or endorse family situations that violate its sincerely held religious beliefs.\"\n\nThe agency is happy to refer same-sex couples to other agencies, Rienzi added. \"They are not stopping anyone from fostering or adopting,\" he said.\n\nMelissa Buck and her husband have fostered and adopted several children through St. Vincent Catholic Charities in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nThe religious agencies have rights, too, he said. So do other foster parents who support St. Vincent's faith-based mission, who would be cut off from its support services if St. Vincent has to close, he said.\n\nMelissa Buck is one of those people. She is concerned that if the Dumonts prevail, St. Vincent will close its doors, depriving her of the ability to foster more children. She and her husband adopted five special needs children through St. Vincent, and they continue to rely on them for counseling for the children and other support services, such as dealing with birth parents.\n\n\"When you decide to foster and adopt you need a group of people around you that will be able to walk that journey with you,\" Buck said in a phone interview.\n\n\"They have supported us every step of the way, and it doesn't end when the judge bangs a gavel and the kids have your last name.\"\n\nRienzi said there are other agencies the couple could work with. But that's not the point, the Dumonts say.\n\nThe lawsuit isn't just about them anymore. They say it's about ensuring that children have access to a bigger pool of prospective parents and making sure that all same-sex couples have the same access as everyone to taxpayer-funded services.\n\nDana and Kristy Dumont with Dana's sister and nieces.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Borman denied motions to dismiss the Dumonts' lawsuit from St. Vincent and DHHS, paving the way for a trial if the case doesn't settle before then.\n\nIn his September ruling, he noted that the Dumonts \"are not seeking the services of any particular child placing agency.\" Instead, \"they seek the opportunity to adopt a child based on the same criteria applied to every other family seeking to adopt in Michigan.\"\n\n\"If they are granted the relief they seek, those barriers will be eliminated, and they will be able to pursue adoption on equal footing with other Michigan families. No speculative inferences are necessary here to conclude that the relief requested will result in the Plaintiffs receiving the dignity and equal treatment they seek.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "All the times police were called on African-Americans for doing normal tasks this year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/F5-eAS6RYV4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It's happened yet again.\n\nAn African-American man in suburban Cleveland says a bank teller called police on him this month when he tried to cash a check from his employer.

Thomas Sherman, commander of the 88th Air Base Wing, told reporters Wednesday. \"Sounds, yells, sights.

Role-players acted as victims who had been shot. Drills are held twice a year, per Air Force policy.\n\nAt the same time, the medical group was holding its hospital drill and mock-patients were coming into the emergency room.\n\nThe after-action report says that while the medical drill was \"socialized\" to the inspector general, it was not noted on the script for the events of the exercise.\n\nHow it escalated\n\nAfter the injured jogger called a coworker at the hospital, they were picked up and brought to the ER, where employees pretending to be injured were also arriving as part of the mass casualty drill.\n\nAt the same time, emergency responders on base were hurrying to the chapel as part of the second drill.\n\nA lot was going on at once, Sherman told reporters. \"What we had on August 2 on this base was a highly difficult, high-risk scenario,\" he said.\n\nIn the confusion, someone in the emergency room called the base's defense operations center reporting a real active shooter, the report said. The hospital broadcasted a \"Code Silver\" alert over its intercom system alerting hospital staff to an active shooter situation, and the hospital went into lockdown.\n\nWhen one employee heard the \"Code Silver\" alert, they called 911 on their cell phone -- and civilian law enforcement rushed to respond -- what's known as a Code 99 response.\n\nHow real shots got fired\n\nUnits from the Dayton area and the state of Ohio responded en masse.\n\nAt the same time, authorities on base requested a SWAT team. They didn't know about the Code 99 response.\n\nSoon there were officers all over the hospital grounds. \"We had a sincere effort from the local community to come provide support. ... They rapidly responded to an event that was unfolding that they believed to be true,\" Sherman said.\n\nSome of them had problems communicating with the incident commander -- Sherman said that would be the base fire chief on duty -- because the Air Force and local police systems didn't work together. Some never checked in with the incident commander, the Air Force said. Some who did had trouble identifying the chief on the radio.\n\nAir Force security went into the hospital. And when one airman encountered a locked door, five shots were fired.\n\nOther people in the hospital heard those shots, and more calls went out to 911.\n\nThough the incident commander quickly learned that Air Force security had fired the shots, 50 other civilian responders didn't get the message, the report said, \"breached the front door of the hospital and entered with weapons drawn.\"\n\nOfficials later deemed the airman's use of a weapon was inappropriate, and left discipline to their commanding officer. The incident is under investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n\nNo one was seriously hurt, the colonel said.\n\nWhat the Air Force is doing in response\n\nThe report made recommendations for the base to improve its communications about drill exercises, and inter-operability with state and local first responders.\n\n\"We are completely revamping our exercise process,\" Sherman said at the news conference.\n\nHe said he didn't want to second guess the person who called base security because they believed they were truly in danger.\n\nWhile the base commander wasn't willing to criticize anyone, he repeatedly called the events an opportunity for lessons learned.

If Trump cannot secure the $5 billion he is demanding for the wall now, it's unlikely he will see a spending bill that meets his requirement for at least two years as Democrats assume control.\n\nStewing at the White House, Trump ranted on Twitter that he'd been down a similar road earlier this year, only to find himself again in the same position.\n\nHe summoned House Republicans -- who thought they'd struck a deal to avert a shutdown -- for noontime talks at the White House.\n\n\"President Trump just met with Republican Members of the House. Not surprisingly, they all feel strongly about border security -- stopping the flow of drugs, stopping human trafficking and stopping terrorism. We protect nations all over the world, but Democrats are unwilling to protect our nation.

OMB guidance states that two business days before a potential lapse, agencies need to notify employees of their work and pay status under a lapse -- that is, if they are furloughed or excepted. Agencies were directed by OMB to start that notification this morning,\" the official said.\n\nThe last-minute scramble came after several days of whiplash, which began last week when Trump said in a meeting with Democrats that he would be proud to oversee a shutdown if it meant securing funds for the wall.\n\nLater, the White House signaled he was softening on that stance, indicating the President was open to a compromise that fell short of providing the $5 billion Trump is demanding.\n\nThat provided an opening for Republican lawmakers to begin proceedings on a measure that would provide funding for nine federal agencies through February. That bill passed the Senate on Wednesday evening.\n\nBut on Thursday morning, the future of that plan was thrust into question after Trump tweeted his frustration at having to swallow another spending measure that doesn't include funds for the wall.\n\nState of play\n\nJUST WATCHED Eyes on Trump as Senate passes funding bill Replay More Videos ...

The White House has refused to say whether he would still travel there if the shutdown occurs. Included in the federal agencies affected would be the Secret Service, whose agents and officers would still work to protect the President and his family, just on an unpaid basis.\n\nA senior White House official told CNN Friday it's possible that Trump will decide not to back down on the wall fight as a result of growing pressure from the Freedom Caucus and conservatives.\n\nThe official said it's still unclear what Trump will do -- a similar situation to the omnibus signing last March.\n\n\"If Congress can't give the President border wall funding now with Republicans in charge we certainly don't stand a chance with (House Democratic Leader Nancy) Pelosi and the Dems taking over the House next year,\" the official said.\n\nMixed signals\n\nJUST WATCHED Berman calls Trump's bluff about border wall Replay More Videos ...

The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ...

When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

More than 8% of respondents 15 to 19 used these methods, while less than 7% of women 40 to 49 did.\n\n\"LARC's are very safe now and becoming much more accepted,\" Schapiro wrote. \"For women not ready to permanently prevent pregnancy they are a great option since they don't require remembering a pill every day and keeping up to date on a prescription.\"\n\nMale condoms\n\nMale condoms were the fourth most common method, used by 8.7% of those surveyed.\n\nThat's a decline from 9.2% of respondents reporting use from 2011 to 2015.\n\nNow, women 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 used condoms the most: 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively. Just more than 5% of respondents 15 to 19 and 40 to 49 relied on condoms for contraception.\n\nOther methods\n\nMale sterilization, or vasectomies, was relied on by 5.9% of women. That's an increase from 4.5% of those surveyed from 2011 to 2015.\n\nDepo-Provera (a birth control shot), the contraceptive ring or the patch accounted for 3.2% of used methods. And all other methods were used with 5.6% of women.\n\n\"The pill and sterilization are our oldest forms of birth control and women are more familiar with them, so many women use what they are familiar with. However, as newer devices come unto the market and become popular, that may change,\" Brandi said.\n\nThe new report found that contraceptive use went up with age, with 37.2% of women 15 to 19, 61.9% of those 20 to 29, 72% of women 30 to 39 and 73.7% of women 40 to 49 using contraception.\n\nContraceptive pill use was highest among non-Hispanic white women (14.9%); 9.2% of Hispanic women and 8.3% of non-Hispanic black women reported relying on the pill.\n\nCondom use and long-acting reversible contraceptive use, across racial backgrounds, did not differ with any significance.\n\nEducation levels also made a difference in what methods women used. The higher the level of education, the less likely a woman was to rely on sterilization. Of women who were sterilized, 41.9% had no high school diploma or GED, 32.1% had a high school diploma or GED, 23.7% had some college education, and 11.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nConversely, use of the pill went up according to education levels. Of those who relied on contraceptive pills, 4.9% had no high school degree or GED, 7% had a high school degree or GED, 10.1% had some college, and 16.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\n\"It is important to understand what certain demographics are using so we understand their preferences and make sure that everyone has access to all forms of contraception,\" Brandi noted.\n\nThe 35% of women who were not using contraception when they were interviewed were either not sexually active (17%), were pregnant, were postpartum or were looking to get pregnant (7.5%), nonusers of contraception who'd been sexually active (7.9%) or nonusers for other reasons, like nonsurgical sterility (2.7%)."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "New year brings altered landscape for abortion battle", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/tLxnC9ySkhc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Those engaged in the battle over abortion in the United States are looking out at the thorny landscape and gearing up for what is on the horizon in 2019.\n\nWhat they see includes a more conservative US Supreme Court, 85 confirmed judges appointed by President Donald Trump who are reshaping the courts, and legislative bodies -- both state and federal -- transformed by a contentious midterm election.\n\nExperts from four groups dedicated to protecting abortion access spoke with reporters on a conference callMonday afternoon to discuss what lies ahead from their perspective. On the call were representatives from the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Network of Abortion Funds\n\nThey spoke of the more than 400-and-counting restrictions to abortion access that have been enacted at the state level since 2010 and vowed that this is not a time to stop fighting. Even though Roe v. Wade remains on the books, they said, some states forge ahead as if it has been overturned. They also discussed how barriers to abortion access effectively prohibit the procedure for many, especially for low-income populations, people of color and younger people.\n\n\"Even today,\" said Jennifer Davlen, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , \"the constitutional right to abortion is more theoretical than real.\"\n\nCourt rulings that deny restrictions simply get ignored or appealed, said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nShe said Louisiana, which has only three abortion clinics, is trying to enact laws to close clinics that are identical to a Texas effort that was struck down by the Supreme Court two years ago in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt.\n\nBy instituting \"systematic barriers,\" states are chipping away at what should be protected, said Rachel Sussman, national director of state policy and advocacy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America\n\nThat means the threat to Roe v. Wade remains strong, even as the support of it has grown, they said. Several mentioned a Gallup Poll from the summer that showed nearly two-thirds of Americans -- or 64% -- want to uphold the 1973 Supreme Court decision, including 41% of Republicans.\n\nSussman pointed out how three states -- Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan -- kicked out anti-abortion governors. And other states, including New York, Rhode Island and New Mexico, will be pushing to codify protections for abortion access.\n\n\"Voters did their jobs at the polls,\" she said. \"Now, we're going to get to work to put their will into action.\"\n\nThe US Supreme Court announced this month that it would not take up a case that might have stopped Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the court chose to honor two lower court decisions that prohibited cuts to funding in Kansas and Louisiana. The high court's decision was backed by new Justice Brett Kavanaugh, making some wonder whether he might not be as conservative as anticipated.\n\nHe and Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to side with the court's liberals, signaling an effort to avoid high-profile abortion-related issues for now.\n\nThat said, both justices \"likely have serious objections,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"But such votes seem to be a signal that they would rather avoid contentious, high-profile disputes for now, at least where possible.\"\n\nA representative from Planned Parenthood insisted Monday that this was a case about Medicaid, not abortion, and that Kavanaugh's \"troubling record\" showed he couldn't be trusted.\n\nSteven Aden, chief legal officer and legal counsel at Americans United for Life, also refused to take the Supreme Court decision as a sign.\n\n\"We're not drawing any conclusions,\" he said. \"There are a number of reasons why the court could have elected not to take the case.\"\n\nAmericans United for Life is a national anti-abortion group that uses legislation, education and litigation to advance its cause. Aden said he's looking ahead with optimism, focusing on the legislative issues and fights that he imagines down the pipeline.\n\nSpecifically, he highlighted four model pieces of legislation his organization has written that he hopes will gain traction next year across the country.\n\nThe Abortion Reporting Act seeks to require reporting of all abortion-related complications and emergencies, the idea being that the procedure is \"practiced in the dark,\" Aden said. \"Only when such a system is in place will we finally be able to unmask the reality of abortion in America.\"\n\nThe Women's Health Defense Act seeks to ban abortions at or after 20 weeks of gestation, except in some cases of medical emergency. \"Abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more dangerous to a woman than carrying to term,\" he said.\n\nThe Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act forbids selective abortions \"seeking to target babies,\" Aden said, based on prenatal diagnostic testing that shows the gender of the baby or a diagnosis such as Down syndrome.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLastly, Aden pointed to the Unborn Infants Dignity Act, which he said \"treats human lives in the womb as just that, human,\" and requires \"cremation or proper burial\" of \"miscarried, stillborn or aborted infants\" and protection from \"scientific experimentation.\"\n\nAll of these efforts are precisely what proponents of abortion access are preparing to address. So the two sides can agree on this: No matter what shifts in the landscape, the hot topic of abortion won't cool down in this coming year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Gatwick Airport: Army called in amid drone chaos", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-46640033", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday as flights were unable to take off or land\n\nThe Army has deployed \"specialist equipment\" to Gatwick Airport as the travel chaos caused by drone activity shows no sign of abating.\n\nIt comes as Easyjet has cancelled all of its flights from Gatwick for the rest of the day.\n\nThe airline, the biggest operator at the airport, said there was \"no indication\" when Gatwick would reopen.\n\nTens of thousands of passengers on several airlines have been disrupted by drones flying over the airport.\n\nIn a tweet, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson had confirmed the military deployment.\n\nHe said: \"The armed forces have a range of unique capabilities and this isn't something we would usually deploy but we are there to assist and do everything we can so that they are in a position to open the airport at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nImage copyright Peter Macdiarmid/LNP Image caption Armed police were seen at the airfield\n\nOfficials from various government departments have been meeting and the prime minister is being kept informed.\n\nTheresa May's spokesman said: \"This is a serious incident, it's causing widespread disruption for passengers.\n\n\"The intention, obviously, is that it should brought to a close as soon as possible.\"\n\nGatwick's runway has been shut since Wednesday night because devices have been repeatedly flown over the airfield.\n\nAn Easyjet spokesperson said: \"We are making every effort to get people to their destination at this important time of the year, but following reports of drones flying over Gatwick Airport, the runway remains closed and all flights are currently suspended.\"\n\nThe airline said it expected disruption to continue into Friday and is advising all passengers to check the status of their flight.\n\nImage caption Passengers stranded at Gatwick waited for updates on their travel options\n\nSussex Police said the drone activity was not terror-related but was a \"deliberate act\" of disruption, using \"industrial specification\" drones.\n\nGatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate agreed it was a \"highly targeted activity\" and added: \"It cannot be right that drones can close a vital part of our national infrastructure in this way.

US officials quoted by Reuters news agency say that in addition, air attacks against IS will cease.\n\nThe SDF statement warned that the withdrawal would \"negatively impact\" the anti-IS campaign and allow the group \"to revive itself again\".\n\nIt said the US move would have \"dangerous implications\" for regional stability and \"create a political and military vacuum... leaving its people between the claws of hostile parties\".\n\nNeighbouring Turkey has said it is poised to launch a military operation against the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - which it regards as a terrorist group.\n\nUS support for the group has strained relations between Washington and Ankara.\n\nWhat has the US announced?\n\nThe Pentagon said it was transitioning to the \"next phase of the campaign\" to eliminate IS but did not provide further details.\n\nPresident Trump, who has long pledged to pull troops out of Syria, said on Twitter that it was time to bring them home after their \"historic victories\".\n\nIn a later tweet, he defended his decision and said it should not have come as a surprise.\n\nThe White House would not give a timescale for the withdrawal but defence officials quoted by the New York Times said President Trump wanted it done within 30 days.\n\nWhat other reaction has there been?\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is one of Mr Trump's supporters and sits on the armed services committee, called the withdrawal decision a \"huge Obama-like mistake\", which would have \"devastating consequences\" both in Syria and beyond.\n\nHe said he feared it would mean ceding influence in the region to Russia and Iran.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Bob Corker, who is chair of the foreign relations committee, went further, saying it was \"much worse\" than Barack Obama's decision to pull US troops out of Iraq when he did.\n\n\"This is a transactional, political decision. It is not a decision based on facts on the ground,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"It is going to harm us, it's going to harm the people who care about ridding the world of Isis (IS), it's harming our relations.

Now they are left as one spokesman for the largely Kurdish Syria Democratic Forces put it - \"between the claws of hostile parties.\"\n\nTurkey seems ready to push southwards, further into Syria to neutralise Kurdish fighters.\n\nThe Syrian regime has scores to settle. And IS, while significantly weakened, could still re-emerge from any security vacuum left by the US departure. The Kurds have secured a significant degree of autonomy in this part of Syria, but how long will this last?\n\nThe Kurds are divided between four countries - Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran - and riven by sectional disputes of their own. Their dreams of statehood seem as far away as ever.\n\nWhat has Turkey said?\n\nOn Thursday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar issued a stark warning to YPG fighters, saying they \"will be buried in their ditches when the time comes\".\n\nOn Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the military operation against the YPG would start soon.\n\nHe added that he had discussed his plan with Mr Trump by telephone and that he had given a \"positive response\".\n\nA spokesman for Kurdish authorities in north-eastern Syria, Aldar Xelil, told Ronahi TV that no-one was clear on details of the withdrawal \"including US commanders here\".\n\nHowever, he called for continued protests against the looming Turkish operation.\n\nWhat is the US military operation in Syria?\n\nAs well as having troops in the north-east, the US has also been part of an international coalition conducting air strikes against IS and other militants.\n\nAlthough diminished, IS has not disappeared entirely.

\"indicative\" votes on \"Plan B\" options should MPs reject the PM's agreement.\n\n\"It would flush out where... the majority is,\" she said. \"So people who hold on to the idea of one option or

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa hack exposes space agency staff's data", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46622467", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Nasa said employees who had worked for the agency since 2006 were at risk\n\nNasa has emailed its staff to warn them that hackers may have stolen their personal details.\n\nThe message said it suspected that two of its servers containing details of past and present employees had been compromised.\n\nIt added that it did not believe any Nasa mission had been put in jeopardy.\n\nOne expert noted that this was the latest in a series of breaches experienced by the space agency to have been made public since 2011.\n\nIn this case, the memo involved was published by the SpaceRef news site.\n\nIt said that a probe into the incidents had been ongoing since 23 October.\n\n\"Our entire leadership team takes the protection of personal information very seriously,\" it said.\n\n\"Nasa is continuing its efforts to secure all servers, and is reviewing its processes and procedures to ensure that the latest security practices are being followed throughout the agency.\"\n\nThe email added that social security numbers and other private information belonging to civil service employees of the agency who had worked for it since July 2006, might have been affected.\n\nPrevious attacks include an incident in which hackers took control of computers in Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2011, and an attack in 2013 that led to eight Nasa web domains being defaced by a gang calling itself the Master Italian Hackers Team.\n\n\"The public want to know that this government agency is learning from the past, we want the post-mortem,\" commented Sam Curry, chief security officer at Cybereason.\n\n\"There are many things at Nasa in the national security domain which are of vital importance.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "New environmental watchdog to get legal teeth after Brexit", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46626932", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters\n\nPlans for a new green watchdog to protect the environment after Brexit have been outlined by the government.\n\nMinisters say the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) will be an independent statutory body to safeguard environmental standards.\n\nIt will have the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental law after Brexit.\n\nGreen groups question its independence and doubt the structure will replicate the EU\u2019s environmental protections.\n\nWhy is a new law needed?\n\nAbout 80% of the UK\u2019s environmental laws have been forged in partnership with other nations in Europe.\n\nSome Brexiteers see leaving the EU as an opportunity to dilute environmental standards to increase competitiveness, but the government has promised this will not happen.\n\nAt the moment, if the UK breaks green laws \u2013 like over air pollution for instance - it gets taken to court by the EU.\n\nUnder the provisions of the draft Environment Bill, the new watchdog will have a similar legal power.

Jasmin Mujanovic, political scientist\n\nJasmin Mujanovic, a political scientist who focuses on southeastern Europe, told Al Jazeera that the push represents the most serious effort by HDZ in Croatia to undermine Bosnia in decades.\n\n\"The combination of threats, disinformation, and brinkmanship has created the impression of virtual irredentism as far as their relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned,\" Mujanovic said.\n\n\"It's also alarming because it represents a sharp departure from the established EU approach to [Bosnia and Herzegovina]. So, while officials in Brussels are calling for dialogue and, in the long term, constitutional reform to address the structural flaws with the Dayton constitution, the HDZ is insisting upon a reactionary, zero-sum programme that actually strengthens the most problematic, segregationist aspects of Bosnia's legal order.\n\n\"In other words, the Zagreb government is working directly against the professed interests of the EU in its present approach to Bosnia.\"\n\n'Deeply concerned'\n\nEarlier in December, Carl Bildt, Christian Schwarz-Schilling and Paddy Ashdown, three former governors of Bosnia and Herzegovina, urged the EU to stop Croatia from interfering in Bosnia's political affairs.\n\nIn a joint letter submitted to Federica Mogherini, the former high representatives wrote that they were \"deeply concerned by Croatia's continued meddling\", advising that any electoral reform should aim to make Bosnia more cohesive rather than divide it further along ethnic lines.\n\n181008185625866\n\n\"Neither [Bosnia and Herzegovina's constitution nor election law] state that presidency members must be elected by members of their 'own group'.\n\n\"To the contrary, electoral rules ... provide a rare crossing-voting mechanism aiming to incentivise moderation over divisive, fear-mongering platforms.\"\n\nThe priority is for the government to be formed, they advised.\n\nCroatia rejected the letter, with Plenkovic responding that no one knows Bosnia better than Croatia and that as a signatory of the Dayton peace accords in 1995 which ended the war, Croatia has an obligation to look after all Croats in the diaspora, according to Croatia's constitution.\n\nThis, however, is not stipulated in the peace accords.\n\n\"No one in Dayton ever thought that such provisions would occur on the ground, that Bosniaks who number three times more than Croats could pick both members of the presidency. That makes no sense,\" Plenkovic told media, adding that as long as he is president, he won't give up on the issue.\n\nAccording to Bosnia's 2013 census, Croats account for 15.43 perent of the population, the vast majority of whom live in the Federation.\n\nSome Croats are now unhappy because their preferred nationalist candidates don't always win Croat-designated seats in Bosnia's elaborate power-sharing arrangements. That does not prove inequality of Croats as a constituent people. Daniel Serwer, former US envoy to Federation entity\n\nDaniel Serwer, who served as the US special envoy for the Federation entity and helped to negotiate the Dayton peace accords, explained that the Croat question is a political - not legal - issue.\n\n\"The Bosnian Croats got a good deal at Dayton in 1995, when Croatia was vital to routing Serb forces,\" Serwer told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Some Croats are now unhappy because their preferred nationalist candidates don't always win Croat-designated seats in Bosnia's elaborate power-sharing arrangements. That does not prove inequality of Croats as a constituent people. It demonstrates political ineffectiveness of particular candidates.\"\n\nCritics of the HDZ have pointed out that in any case, two-thirds of Croats didn't vote for Covic according to Bosnia's Central Election Commission.\n\nFurthermore, HDZ's proposal would isolate Croats living in Bosniak-majority cantons as they would not be able to vote.\n\nA condition for NATO membership\n\nCroatia has raised the issue at EU meetings several times.\n\nIn October, Croatian MEPs warned in a joint letter to the European Parliament that \"developments\" following the election results \"might affect the stability of Bosnia and the wider region\".\n\nDuring a meeting in November with Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO, Croatian HDZ MP Miroslav Tudjman said they had made electoral and constitutional reform a condition for Bosnia in order to continue its Euro-Atlantic integration and eventually join NATO.\n\nHowever, Croatian political analyst Zarko Puhovski told Al Jazeera that the lobbying and the recently adopted declaration don't amount to violating Bosnia's sovereignty as it doesn't exist.\n\n\"Bosnia is half a state, half a protectorate \u2026 it's not a state in the full sense,\" Puhovski said, referring to the international Office of the High Representative which holds ultimate authority over Bosnian officials.\n\n\"It is unclear how you can have in one country three constituent people, but two entities. [The country] was set up crooked from the start. Once it's set up crooked, it's hard to straighten it.\"\n\nPuhovski explained that a civic society with a one-person one-vote system, that would abolish problematic ethnic lines, would require a complete reconstruction of the Dayton accords, which has no chance of happening.\n\nA third entity\n\nThe demand for a third electoral unit would be a step towards creating a third, Croat entity, said analysts.\n\nSerwer explained in his blog that HDZ's argument is not legal, but political.\n\n\"The ruse of electoral illegitimacy and the resulting crisis is simply another effort toward the HDZ's territorial ambitions of creating a so-called 'third entity'. In this, the HDZ leaders are publicly backed by the Government of Croatia and the Russian Federation,\" Serwer wrote.\n\nMujanovic told Al Jazeera that the issue centres on the HDZ's pursuit of permanent power by maintaining and further deepening the country's \"segregationist regime\".\n\n\"The creation of a so-called 'third entity' is the most obvious way to do this; the HDZ is deeply envious of the one-party regime Dodik has built in the Republika Srpska; they want the same in Western Herzegovina,\" Mujanovic said.\n\n\"But if they can't have a third entity, they are prepared to settle for certain, 'virtual' versions thereof, which is what most of their machinations regarding the elections law are about.\n\n\"In fact, in the past, Dragan Covic has explicitly referred to his preferred solutions to this issue as the creation of 'virtual election units', in other words, a third entity at the level of the electoral law,\" Mujanovic said.\n\nMario Karamatic, head of the Bosnian Croat caucus in the House of Peoples, told local media this week that Bosnian Croat political parties are indeed discussing the recreation of the separate Croat republic, \"Herceg-Bosna\", which was dismantled following the peace accords.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia had ruled that it was a project of a \"joint criminal enterprise\" in which Croatia held parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina under a state of occupation, with the goal of annexing the territory."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

(Credit: Alex Snyder, U.S. Geological Survey, public domain)\n\nLOS ANGELES, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Using a new computer model, U.S. scientists predict that 31 to 67 percent of Southern California beaches could be severely damaged by rising sea levels by the year 2100.\n\nAccording to a new study, published online by the American Geophysical Union in their Journal of Geophysical Research, predictions of shoreline change with limited human intervention indicate that 31 to 67 percent of Southern California beaches may become completely eroded by 2100 under predicted scenarios of one to two meters.\n\n\"Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real. The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Self-Defense Airstrikes in Somalia Kill 11 Al-Shabab", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-self-defense-airstrikes-in-somalia-kill-eleven-al-shabab/4709331.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. military says it has killed 11 al-Shabab extremists with a pair of airstrikes outside Somalia's capital.\n\nThe U.S. Africa Command statement says Wednesday's airstrikes were in self-defense after al-Shabab fighters attacked forces with the Somali military and the African Union peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe statement says U.S. personnel were present \"in an advisory capacity\" and that no U.S., Somali or AU member was harmed.\n\nThe U.S. says the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab has been using the Beled Amin South area about 40 kilometers (24 miles) northwest of Mogadishu to plan attacks on the capital.

Could a withdrawal from Afghanistan be far behind?\n\nTrump has said his instinct is to quit Afghanistan as a lost cause, but more recently he\u2019s suggested a willingness to stay in search of peace with the Taliban. However, the abruptness with which he turned the page on Syria raises questions about whether combat partners like Iraq and Afghanistan should feel confident that he will not pull the plug on them, too.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s willing to walk away from Syria, I think we should be concerned about whether Afghanistan is next,\u201d Jennifer Cafarella, the director of intelligence planning at the Institute for the Study of War, said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. has been at war in Afghanistan for 17 years and still has about 15,000 troops there helping government troops combat the Taliban. The approximately 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are training and advising Iraqi security forces as they continue to fight Islamic State militants, a battle the U.S. entered in 2014 after IS swept into Iraq from Syria.\n\nBefore other officials confirmed the withdrawal decision, Trump tweeted, \u201cWe have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\u201d The aspect of this that he did not address is whether the extremists or others will fill the security vacuum created by the U.S. withdrawal to regroup and pose a new threat.\n\nThe administration said it intends to continue combatting Islamic State extremists globally and could return to Syria if necessary. Still, critics launched a barrage of questions about the implications of Trump\u2019s decision, including whether it opens the door for Turkish forces to attack the Syrian Kurds who had partnered with the U.S.\n\nKori Schake, deputy director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on the Atlantic.com website Wednesday that the Syria decision ought to unsettle every ally that relies on U.S. security assurances.\n\n\u201cThe governments of Iraq and Afghanistan ought to be very, very worried,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor if Syria can be so lightly written off, the fight arbitrarily declared won, what is the argument for continuing to assist Iraq \u2014 where ISIS is even more defeated? And if Trump has so little interest in stabilizing security and assisting governance in Syria, how can Afghanistan have confidence that he won\u2019t make the same decision about them, when the fight there is costlier and progress less evident?\u201d\n\nThese and other questions about the Trump decision and its broader implications were on the minds of many in Congress. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, denounced what he called a betrayal of the Syrian Kurds.\n\n\u201cNow the President seems content to forsake their trust and abandon them to a potentially bloody conflict with Turkey,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThis decision also significantly increases the security risks to our key regional partners in Israel, Iraq and Jordan.\u201d\n\nTrump has argued for a Syria withdrawal since he was a presidential candidate in 2016, and he has repeated his view several times since taking office.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump defended his decision, saying on Twitter: \u201cGetting out of Syria was no surprise. I\u2019ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cDoes the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever?\u201d\n\nStill, the decision appeared to catch many in his administration by surprise; Pentagon officials offered no details on the timing or pace of the withdrawal, nor could they square it with numerous statements by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis about the importance of remaining in Syria to assure stability.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and typically a Trump supporter, said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the decision and called it \u201ca disaster in the making.\u201d He said, \u201cThe biggest winners in this are ISIS and Iran.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the withdrawal would be a \u201cgrave error with broader implications\u201d beyond the fight against IS. He called it \u201cone more example of how the United States is not a reliable partner.\u201d\n\nJust last week, the U.S. special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, Brett McGurk, said U.S. troops would remain in Syria even after the Islamic State militants were driven from their strongholds.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,\u201d McGurk told reporters on Dec. 11. \u201cNobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd two weeks ago, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. still has a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize the country. He said it will take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of them have been trained."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Declares Victory Against Islamic State, Calls Troops Home", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-declares-victory-against-islamic-state-calls-troops-home/4708783.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "With a single tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump shocked many in Washington, changing the course of U.S. policy in Syria and, simultaneously, announcing an end to the fight against the Islamic State terror group's self-declared caliphate.

Ambassador Kim Song said the resolution is \u201ca product of a political plot and hostile forces,\u201d which Pyongyang \u201ccategorically rejects.\u201d\n\nA State Department official said the U.S. will continue to bring up North Korea\u2019s human rights issues.\n\n\u201cThe president raised North Korea\u2019s human rights record in his summit meeting with Chairman Kim (Jong Un), and will continue to raise this issue going forward,\u201d the official said in an email sent to VOA Korean Service on Monday.\n\nThe official added, \u201c(North Korea) is among the most repressive authoritarian states in the world. The United States continues to work with the international community to raise awareness, highlight abuses and violations, promote access to independent information, and keep pressure on (North Korea) to respect human rights.\u201d\n\n\u200bDenuclearization talks\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s warning comes after denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang stalled in early November when North Korea suddenly called off a planned meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIt remains unclear if the human rights issue will derail denuclearization talks.\n\nKen Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at the Center for Naval Analyses, believes the U.S., by raising North Korea\u2019s human rights record, could disrupt denuclearization talks because Pyongyang sees the issue as undercutting agreements it made with Washington at the Singapore summit in June.\n\n\u201cI think it would be because North Korea sees the agreement at the Singapore summit as one of the agreements \u2014 that the objectives, goals that they had \u2014 was to improve the U.S.-North Korean relationships, and North Korea sees these actions by the United States undermining that agreement,\u201d Gause said.\n\nJohn Feffer, director of Foreign Policy in Focus, disagrees. He said the U.S. campaign against North Korea\u2019s human rights violations will not derail denuclearization talks but might \u201cundermine\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cnegotiating position\u201d on the process of denuclearization.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that human rights issues will ultimately derail the talks,\u201d Feffer said. \u201cUltimately, North Korea is more interested in seeking whether Trump will agree to some kind of mutual process of give and take. That is the major hurdle at this point \u2014 the process. The talks will continue to limp along if the process remains murky.\u201d\n\nRobert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, thinks the Trump administration should delink North Korea\u2019s human rights issues from denuclearization talks in the beginning of the negotiation process, because speaking out against North Korea\u2019s human rights violations might divert diplomatic efforts.\n\n\u201cI think it is appropriate for the administration to speak out on the issue,\u201d Manning said. \u201cBut not to link it to denuclearization. If the diplomacy advances, and we begin discussions on U.S.-(North Korea) normalizations, human rights has to be discussed as part of that process.\u201d\n\n\u200bImproving relations\n\nDespite its sharp retort against U.S. actions toward its alleged human rights abuses, Pyongyang credited Trump\u2019s willingness to improve relations with North Korea, suggesting it is open to talks with him.\n\nA State Department official said the Singapore agreements Trump and Kim made on denuclearization will be fulfilled.\n\n\u201cAt the summit in Singapore, President Trump and Chairman Kim made the first leader-level U.S.-(North Korea) commitment on denuclearization in history,\u201d said the official in an email message sent to VOA Korean Service on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident that the commitments made by President Trump and Chairman Kim at their summit Singapore will be fulfilled.\u201d\n\nBaik Sung-won of VOA\u2019s Korean Service contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Honduran Migrant Gunned Down Shortly After US Deportation", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/honduran-migrant-gunned-down-shortly-after-us-deportation-/4708649.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "A Honduran migrant who had recently been deported from the United States was shot and killed a few blocks from his home, his family said Wednesday, in another sign of the dangers faced by migrants fleeing Central\n\nAmerican gangs.\n\nNelson Espinal, 28, was shot 15 times on Tuesday night shortly after leaving his home in the capital Tegucigalpa, said his sister, Patricia Espinal.

In the United States? Is it possible? That only happens in other places in the world,\u2019\u201d Truglio said.\n\nThe Truglios had four healthy children. They learned that cleft lip and cleft palate are two of the most common birth defects worldwide.\n\n\u200bWhat is cleft lip or cleft palate?\n\nA cleft is a gap in the lip or roof of the mouth. Some babies have both a cleft lip and a cleft palate. Depending on the severity, it can be life-threatening.\n\nWith a cleft lip, milk may come out of the baby\u2019s nose while feeding. That\u2019s because the barrier between the mouth and nose may be missing. Because of problems feeding, these children can be malnourished and have stunted growth. These babies can also face serious breathing, feeding, speech and hearing problems. They may not be able to suckle.\n\nChildren with a cleft palate often have frequent ear infections that can lead to hearing loss. They often have problems with speech. Children born with these defects are often stigmatized and subject to bullying.\n\nGenetics can play a role, but no one knows why many babies are born with this defect. Scientists suspect environmental factors play a role.\n\nBabies can have surgery to repair a cleft lip in the first year of life, ideally by the time they are 3 months old. Babies can have a cleft palate repaired between the ages of 18 months to 2 years.\n\n\u200bOperation Smile\n\nMore than 35 years ago, Bill McGee, a dentist and plastic surgeon, traveled to the Philippines to treat children with this condition. He eventually founded Operation Smile to help even more.\n\n\u201cWhen people don\u2019t have access to surgery, their life is really going to be affected,\u201d McGee told VOA.\n\nOperation Smile relies on volunteers to bring this life-changing surgery to children in developing countries. Over the years, McGee says the mission has changed.\n\n\u201cUp until about 1999, all of our volunteers pretty much came out of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, he said, 80 percent of the organization\u2019s volunteers are from the 70 or 80 countries that the charity serves.\n\nFinding a cause\n\nOther volunteer groups now do much the same work. Over the years, Operation Smile has branched out into research. Because of its work, scientists have been able to zero in on a gene that causes the cleft. Volunteers found two sisters and their brother with cleft lip and palate.\n\nResearchers at the University of Southern California studied their genes to see if they could find one that all three children shared. Dr. Yang Chai led the study.\n\n\u201cNormally, you would only see one child in the family of three or four children that develop this birth defect. Finding this birth defect in every single child in a family is like catching lightning in a bottle, because it allowed us to pinpoint the gene mutation that is probably responsible,\u201d Chai said.\n\nResearchers also found the children\u2019s father had the same genetic mutation. He, too, had a cleft lip and cleft palate. Researchers then replicated the genetic abnormality in mice.\n\n\u201cYou discover a mutation in a human study, (but) then you go to an animal model to basically mimic the same mutation, and ... if the animal model also develops the same birth defects, you have some proof this (genetic mutation) is really responsible.\u201d\n\nAll of the pups born from the mice with this genetic mutation had cleft lip and cleft palate.\n\nOther causes\n\nChai said his research can help parents prepare for their children\u2019s surgery. Ultimately, Chai hopes scientists will one day prevent children with this mutation from having cleft lip or palate. But that\u2019s a long way off, and there are other risk factors.\n\nGenetics plays a role in 30 percent of the cases of cleft lip and cleft palate. Scientists are still searching for other environmental risk factors.\n\nLast spring, Daniel Truglio had his cleft palate repaired and another surgery on his mouth. He is getting speech therapy. Daniel was born with other associated birth defects and still faces more surgeries.\n\nHis parents want other parents to know that Daniel is as lovable as their other children, and their hopes for him are the same as their hopes for the others.\n\nRoblyn Truglio said their only desire is that Daniel has a happy, wonderful life, and that he\u2019s able to accomplish his dreams."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate: No Reason Not to Live a Normal Life", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cleft-lip-and-cleft-palate-no-reason-not-to-live-a-normal-life-/4708620.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "It's one of the most common birth defects in the world.

Tech executives complain about intellectual property theft in China and what they see as unfair conditions for doing business. But the two regions have strengthened their bonds through investment, trade and partnerships in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous cars.\n\nThe tensions have left tech executives questioning what they can share about their work, said Stanley Kwong, adjunct professor at the University of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cAll of these people are worried if they traveled back and forth, they might be arrested because of the IP, something they know and they talk about in both China, and in the USA,\u201d he said.\n\nSilicon Valley firms have complained the relationship \u201cisn\u2019t as reciprocal as it needs to be,\u201d said Sean Randolph, senior director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.\n\nThe relationship, from some tech firms\u2019 point of view, is about \u201cthe extraction of technologies involuntarily from foreign companies to accelerate China's technology leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nCritical technologies\n\nChinese money that has helped fuel the current tech boom in Silicon Valley may start drying up. One reason \u2014 a new U.S. law, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), beefed up oversight of foreign investment and acquisitions of critical technology that are deemed strategically important. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has expanded powers to block foreign purchases of U.S. firms.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley people have been optimistic for a long time,\u201d said Xiaohua Yang, professor of international business at the University of San Francisco. \u201cBut now, they have begun to worry \u2026 about the lack of Chinese investment coming to support Silicon Valley technology development.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are concerned that U.S. tech companies, as they pursue the Chinese market or seek Chinese investment, might hand over core technology to the Chinese government, a competitor and sometime adversary on the global stage. The tech industry waits, as what constitutes \u201ccritical technologies\u201d under FIRRMA is still being developed.\n\nFor U.S. entrepreneurs, the changing climate may mean they will become more cautious, said Kwong, who advises startups.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do business in China, if you're doing consumer products, I say, that's probably fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let's presume you're doing AI. You better find out exactly what you're doing. You can have AI in a coffee machine, and I don't think that's much to do with defense. If you're doing facial recognition that may be something that's going to have a major problem.\u201d\n\nRandolph said that the tech industry has long had an \u201copen market, open platform\u201d approach, with the idea that anyone can come and \u201cwe're moving innovation forward globally.\u201d\n\nBut if tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to escalate, experts say, the very openness of Silicon Valley may be a casualty \u2014 even if tech firms stand to benefit if China becomes more open for doing business."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Empowering Refugees Through Energy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/empowering-refugees-access-to-energy/4687644.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Kakuma, Kenya Jerome Mbusuka fled violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and found safety in a sprawling refugee camp here in Kenya's northwest corner. He also found work as a barber. A solar panel provides electricity for the clippers he uses to trim customers' hair. \"Without solar, it could have been difficult to do business here in Kakuma,\" the 23-year-old says. Mbusuka's purchase of a clean energy source puts him in the vanguard among the camp's 185,000 forcibly displaced residents \u2013 and millions in other refugee camps around the world. Few of them have access to dependable electricity. Even fewer can get affordable, efficient energy such as solar. But Kakuma is generating another kind of power, too: consumer power. The camp and the nearby town for which it's named serve as a laboratory for growing a formal market economy and that depends on access to reliable energy. At refugee camps, \"sustainable energy access (at refugee camps) is not going to be reliant on aid and handout but rather a robust market ecosystem,\u201d said Tijana Radojicic, a senior adviser with the Moving Energy Initiative (MEI). Radojicic was among the speakers at a town hall held at the Kakuma camp on November 27. At least 150 residents gathered in a big tent for the event, co-sponsored by the Voice of America [[www.voanews.com]] and MEI, to learn more about their prospects and their peers such as Mbusuka. The Moving Energy Initiative \u2013 based at the British policy research institute Chatham House \u2013 is an international partnership working to sustainably meet the energy needs of refugees, displaced people and neighboring communities. It\u2019s promoting private sector, clean energy projects in Kenya, Burkina Faso and Jordan. One partner is the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency. The U.N. has a global goal of improving access to clean, reliable and sustainable energy as part of an effort to alleviate poverty and raise living standards.\n\n\u200b Range of challenges\n\nAn estimated 1 billion people worldwide, mostly in Africa and Asia, lack access to electricity, the International Energy Agency reports. In sub-Saharan Africa, only four in 10 households have access \u2013 a rate that dwindles further in rural areas, according to the World Bank. In the remote Kakuma town and camp, away from any power grid, just 5 percent of the combined 250,000 residents have electricity. Refugees and displaced people predominantly rely on wood, charcoal and kerosene \u2013 fuels that MEI describes as \u201cinefficient, dirty and dangerous.\u201d It estimates 20,000 people a year die prematurely of related respiratory illnesses. Collecting firewood poses a hazard, too. Susan Mohamed, a panelist and refugee who trains youth in reproductive health issues, said camp residents face hostility from locals competing for scarce fuel. \u201cSome girls are raped in the bush,\u201d she said, \u201cand other boys are beaten and chased away by the host community.\u201d The Kakuma camp opened in 1992 to shelter people who fled conflict in Sudan, and now includes refugees from South Sudan, Somalia and more than a dozen other countries. Facing work and property restrictions, they depend on aid and some firewood rations. Many also receive remittances from relatives abroad. \"I see myself in a lot of you,\u201d moderator Ayen Bior told audience members at the town hall. The VOA journalist, born in Itang camp in Ethiopia\u2019s Gambella region, lived in refugee camps until age 7 when her family came to the United States. Her family spent a few weeks at Kakuma, where she still has relatives. Interdependence with host community\n\nThe camp lies in the western part of Turkana, Kenya\u2019s poorest county, where four out of five residents live in poverty. But despite some tensions, locals recognize that their economy heavily depends on displaced people and the humanitarian groups that serve them. Turkana County also is home to Kalobeyei, which opened in 2016 as \u201cthe world\u2019s first settlement specifically designed to allow refugees and members of the host community to live and work alongside one another,\u201d as Foreign Policy observed in a recent article. Kalobeyei is a model to demonstrate \u201csocio-economic cohesion for both refugees and the host community,\u201d UNHCR environment specialist Natalie Ndunda said from the town hall audience. While poverty exists in both camp and town, so does plenty of commerce. A report last spring by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank\u2019s investment arm, found an informal camp marketplace humming with at least 2,000 small businesses. These include internet cafes, mobile phone vendors, sellers of produce, goat meat and clothing, and services from bike repair to sewing. \"Frequently, there is this misperception people don\u2019t have access to money,\u201d Andrew Herscowitz, who coordinates the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Power Africa program, said in a video shown at the town hall. \u201cIn some cases, that\u2019s true, but if we can tap into limited resources development partners and donor agencies have, and the money people have in their pocket, we can help make everything more efficient, more competitive, so that people can have greater opportunities and greater options.\" The challenge is convincing investors that people in displacement communities will pay, even if they have modest means. Kakuma town and camp households\u2019 combined spending tops $56 million a year, the IFC report said. But their per capita household consumption \u2013 at $602 and $94, respectively \u2013 still trailed the Kenyan average of $800 in 2016.\n\nPulling together\n\nIt takes collaboration to make a market-driven system work in a humanitarian setting. Radojicic identified the key players as consumers: the private sector, to supply quality products and then to create jobs for selling and maintaining them; financial institutions to provide working capital and to help consumers with the up-front costs of clean energy systems; and policymakers who encourage broad participation in the market. Development partners and humanitarian agencies should ensure that incentives and bridge financing get provided, Radojivic said. And, she added, they should lead by example, \u201crunning their camp management and energy services through solar power.\u201d A UNHCR clinic in Kakuma camp received solar panels several months ago after health workers said an unreliable power source disrupted medical procedures and spoiled temperature-sensitive vaccines. Since then, the clinic has extended its hours of service and lessened patients\u2019 wait times. A new MEI report urges humanitarian groups to phase out their use of diesel-run generators and oil, reducing costs and dirty emissions. \"The Costs of Fueling Humanitarian Aid\" estimates that aid groups spent roughly $1.2 billion last year on such fuels to operate schools, clinics, water pumps and more. By switching to solar or other green energy, it says, the groups could save roughly $500 million a year. Looking ahead\n\nUNHCR\u2019s Ndunda said the Kalobeyei settlement is scheduled to get its first mini-power grid to cover households and businesses in a modular plan that could be expanded over time. \u201cMoving forward,\u201d Ndunda added, \u201cwe\u2019re looking to larger-scale investments like a solar farm that would feed into the national grid and be able to provide sustainable and reliable electricity\u201d to all of western Turkana. Esther Kiyonga, a panelist and a local official in Turkana, said the county was working with government, humanitarian and other partners to \u201charmonize\u201d economic development. Kiyonga and other speakers called for more skills training for refugees but also urged them to take more responsibility as paying consumers. Glada Lahn, a Chatham House senior researcher, echoed that sentiment in a VOA interview. \"In the case of refugees and displaced people, the humanitarian system has tended to see them as beneficiaries of aid, and that\u2019s changing,\" she said. \"There is a need, after you\u2019ve been in a camp for several years \u2026 to move away from aid and toward greater self-reliance,\" she said. \"And, you know, in terms of preparing people for when they return to their countries or they settle somewhere permanently, they need to have skills, a means of generating income.\" Victor Ndiege, a program manager for the development institution Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, told the audience to prepare for more investment. \u201cIn the coming one year,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will see a lot of financing that will be coming to Kakuma \u2026 to ensure that private-sector companies are entering the market. \u2026 They recognize now that you are an economic actor and that you are a customer. Make use of that opportunity and ensure that you get quality services.\u201d Mohammed Yusuf reported from Kakuma, Kenya, with Carol Guensburg reporting and writing from Washington, D.C."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Drones Shut Down Britain's Second-Biggest Airport During Peak Holiday Travel Season", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gatwick-airport-drones_us_5c1b7a49e4b0407e90779121", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "London\u2019s Gatwick Airport remains closed to flights after operations were suspended on Wednesday evening following reports of two drones flying over the airfield.\n\nFlights in and out of the airport were suspended at about 9pm on Wednesday after two drones were sighted near the airfield, with hundreds of flights cancelled and tens of thousands of passengers affected.\n\nGatwick, which is used by more than 40 million passengers each year and is Britain\u2019s second-biggest airport after Heathrow, briefly reopened at about 3am on Thursday \u2013 but shut once more just 45 minutes later.\n\nPress Association A helicopter conducts searches above Gatwick's runway on Thursday morning.\n\nIn its latest statement, the airport said on Thursday: \u201cAll flights to and from Gatwick are suspended due to ongoing drone activity activity around the airport.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are significant delays and cancellations to all flights today.\u201d\n\nPassengers are advised to check before they travel to the airport, amid chaotic scenes as thousands remain stranded in terminal buildings.\n\nLast night, passengers due to take off reported planes being stuck on the airport\u2019s apron for more than an hour.\n\nSussex Police confirmed officers continue to investigate, and ruled out any links to terror.\n\nSuperintendent Justin Burtenshaw said: \u201cWe believe this to be a deliberate act to disrupt the airport.

The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seoul\u2019s rosier presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the fragile trilateral diplomacy to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war.\n\nThe latest from North Korea comes as the United States and North Korea struggle over the sequencing of the denuclearization that Washington wants and the removal of international sanctions desired by Pyongyang. The statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency also raises credibility problems for the liberal South Korean government, which has continuously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nuclear weapons as Seoul tries to sustain a positive atmosphere for dialogue.\n\nThe North\u2019s comments may also be seen as proof of what outside skeptics have long said: that Kim will never voluntarily relinquish an arsenal he sees as a stronger guarantee of survival than whatever security assurances the United States might provide. The statement suggests North Korea will demand the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a major sticking point in any disarmament deal.\n\nKim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they agreed on a vague goal for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. The leaders are trying to arrange another meeting for early next year.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday\u2019s statement, the North made clear it\u2019s sticking to its traditional stance on denuclearization. It accused Washington of twisting what had been agreed on in Singapore and driving post-summit talks into an impasse.\n\n\u201cThe United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images File photo, taken on July 4, 2017, shows North Korea's test-fire of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 at an undisclosed location.\n\nThe United States removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s. Washington and Seoul did not immediately respond to the North Korean statement.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s reiteration of its long-standing position on denuclearization could prove to be a major setback for diplomacy, which was revived early this year following a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests that left Kim and Trump spending most of 2017 exchanging personal insults and war threats. The statement could jeopardize a second Trump-Kim summit as the United States may have difficulty negotiating further if the North ties the future of its nukes to the U.S. military presence in the South, analysts said.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim three times this year and lobbied hard for the Trump-Kim meeting, has said Kim wasn\u2019t demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons. But Kim has never made such comments in public.\n\n\u201cThe blunt statement could be an indicator that the North has no intentions to return to the negotiation table anytime soon,\u201d said Shin Beomchul, a senior analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the North intends to keep its nukes and turn the diplomatic process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation with the United States, rather than a process where it unilaterally surrenders its program.\u201d\n\nYang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul\u2019s University of North Korean Studies, said that the North will likely maintain its commitment to talks but has also been strengthening its demands for sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cPyongyang is sending a message to Washington that confrontation and dialogue cannot coexist,\u201d Yang said.\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first.\n\nSince engaging in diplomacy, North Korea has unilaterally dismantled its nuclear testing ground and parts of a missile engine test facility and suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests. However, none of those moves were verified by outsiders, and most experts say they fall short as material steps toward denuclearization.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.\n\nBehind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.\n\nThis is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.\n\nThe Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory at the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nChinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into \u201ca modern civilized\u201d world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.\n\nThe Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making \u201cmany untrue reports\u201d about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.\n\n\u201cThose reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,\u201d the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.\n\nHowever, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.\n\nPayment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said \u2014 barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees \u2014 or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there \u2014 are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nA former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.\n\n\u201cThe camp didn\u2019t pay any money, not a single cent,\u201d he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. \u201cEven for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.\u201d\n\nRushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\n\u201cAmerican companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 9, 2018, photo, Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp, holds up a phone showing a state television report about what Beijing calls \"vocational training centers\" for a photo in a restaurant in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Koksebek says that shortly before he was released from the camp in April, the camp's director strode into his class and told them they would soon be opening a new factory, and that detainees would be required to work and taught how to cook, sew, and repair cars.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.\n\nAbout two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.\n\nMen and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Kaliaskar says her daughter, a college graduate who had a job in advertising, was detained in an internment camp in China's far western region of Xinjiang and is now being forced to make clothes for no pay.\n\nAs China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a \u201cvocational skills education and training center\u201d in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.\n\n\u201cTerrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,\u201d the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this \u201cglobal issue.\u201d\n\nWu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be \u201cunproblematic,\u201d he said, adding that the center is government-operated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making our contribution to eradicating poverty,\u201d Wu told the AP over the phone.\n\nThe 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.\n\nTrainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn\u2019t come here,\u201d one Uighur student said. \u201cThe party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.\u201d\n\nThe segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida\u2019s main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a child stands near a large screen showing photos of Chinese President Xi Jinping near a carpark in Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nPolice told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a \u201cmilitary facility.\u201d Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an \u201capparel employment training base.\u201d\n\nPosters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as \u201cLearn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person\u201d and \u201cNo need to pay tuition, find a job easily.\u201d\n\nNathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida\u2019s case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.\n\n\u201cThere are watchtowers throughout,\u201d Ruser said. \u201cThere are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.\u201d\n\nThe AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.\n\nAt least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.\n\nSprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp\u2019s sewing factory floor.\n\nShawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear\u2019s marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she\u2019s surprised the workers are \u201cfriendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Monday, Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a guard tower and barbed wire fences are seen around a facility in the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region.\n\nBadger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island\u2019s Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it\u2019s impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.\n\nAll the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.\n\nBadger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.\n\n\u201cWe will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,\u201d he said.\n\nBadger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.\n\nIn recent years, Badger imported sportswear \u2014 jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more \u2014 from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.\n\nThe U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention \u201ctraining\u201d there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.\n\nNew Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.\n\n\u201cNot only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,\u201d said Smith. \u201cU.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rushan Abbas, 51, of Herndon, Va., holds a photo of her sister, Gulshan Abbas, Monday, Dec. 17, 2018, in Washington. Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among the many Uighurs detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\nThe detention camp system is part of China\u2019s increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.\n\nNot all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn\u2019t have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,\u201d said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.\n\nInterviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director\u2019s words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to open a factory, you\u2019re going to work,\u201d Koksebek recalled him as saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.\u201d\n\nThis fall, months after Koksebek\u2019s release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.\n\nIn October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that \u201csome trainees\u201d were nearly done with their \u201ccourses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,\u201d Zahir said.\n\nThe forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang\u2019s economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.\n\nA hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read \u201cHouse of Workers\u201d could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018, photo, residents pass by the entrance to the \"Hotan City apparel employment training base\" where Hetian Taida has a factory in Hotan in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nMany of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder\u2019s wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.\n\nThen last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn\u2019t answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.\n\nFour months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for \u201cpolitical training.\u201d The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter\u2019s clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.\n\nLast month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar\u2019s brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.\n\nKaliaskar learned her daughter wasn\u2019t being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn\u2019t leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she\u2019s well educated and had a job,\u201d said Kaliaskar. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this training?\u201d\n\nA former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.\n\nIf they ran from the factories, they were warned, they\u2019d be taken straight back to the camps for \u201cfurther education.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory in the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nFarmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing\u2019s past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.\n\n\u201cI never asked the government to find work for my husband,\u201d said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.\n\nShe has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she\u2019s not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek\u2019s husband used to earn.\n\nSince her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a factory, but it\u2019s an excuse for detention. They don\u2019t have freedom, there\u2019s no time for him to talk with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they found a job for him.

In October, an international body of climate scientists declared humans have a little more than a decade to make the drastic changes needed to keep rising temperatures reasonably in check. In November, federal scientists released an equally grim assessment detailing the unprecedented floods, droughts and wildfires expected to hit the United States. Then, this month, with the world ablaze, diplomats gathered in Poland to bicker over how much water each country should pour on their respective fires and, in some cases, whether scientists were exaggerating the size of the flames.\n\nIt\u2019s bad, for sure, and worse than most people realize. Many scientists and advocates go to great lengths to keep sanguine about the carbon crisis, even when the news is certifiably grim, and this threatens to undermine public understanding of climate change. Too many spoonfuls of sugar blunt the effect of the medicine.\n\nWhen asked about the bleak climate news of late, Al Gore admitted in an interview with Intelligencer, \u201cI have more than a few periods when I struggle with the difference between hope and despair,\u201d before quickly adding that the work to stop climate change is \u201caccelerating, for sure.\u201d Gore, who has repeatedly made the case for optimism on climate change, has spoken in an interview with Politico about \u201cthe need to deliver the message that we\u2019re winning. The hope is real. It\u2019s not a forced smile.\u201d\n\nJD Lasica Al Gore\n\nEmissions are rising and governments are stalling, but advocates remain relentlessly optimistic, anxiously pointing to the few rays of hope while staring into the abyss. Scientists, too, have warned against giving in to pessimism, as have a number of writers. Whenever the prospects for planet Earth start to look too dreary, the climate chorus chimes in on the need to stay upbeat.\n\nThis line of thinking derives from a relatively young and limited body of research into how people think about climate change, which has produced findings that are frequently overstated or misunderstood. Studies showing that people must feel empowered to act on climate change have been interpreted as a mandate for hope. The polling does not suggest there is a deficit of hope, however. If anything, Americans are not as worried as the science suggests they should be. Scientists, writers and advocates should not shy away from speaking honestly about climate change.\n\nNexus Media\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that most Americans would be a lot more worried about climate change if they understood even a small fraction of what has been projected by climate scientists in (recent reports). As a public health professional (and as a human), I find the prospect of 3 or 4 degree C of global warming to be nothing short of terrifying,\u201d Ed Maibach, director of the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, said in an email. \u201cThus, we need to do a much better job of sharing what we know about the likely impacts of global warming, because people are not nearly as worried as the situation warrants.\u201d\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence that Earth is headed for a planetary catastrophe, Americans just aren\u2019t that bothered about climate change. Only around half have thought about it more than \u201ca little,\u201d according to research from Yale and George Mason University. Only around a third say it is personally important to them, and just one in five say they are \u201cvery worried\u201d about it. Numbers like that suggest scientists and advocates have perhaps been too cheerful on climate change, too reluctant to speak to the catastrophe to come.\n\nCarbon Brief Impacts at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C of warming.\n\nTrue, researchers have suggested that pessimism can lead to inaction. People who are less hopeful are less likely to take action. If one truly believes that climate change is a lost cause, then there is nothing left to do but party like it\u2019s 1999 \u2014 literally. But the findings are far from conclusive. \u201cOur recently self-published analysis suggests that people who are more hopeful seem to be taking more action, but there has been relatively little research on this question,\u201d Maibach said.\n\nIn many cases, fear can also be motivating. Studies show this is true even in the context of climate change, where gloomy messages can make people feel more concerned. Moreover, studies find that an especially rosy portrayal of climate change can leave people feeling too optimistic, too unlikely to take action. If people feel like everything will turn out alright, why bother getting off the couch?\n\nIPCC This graph shows carbon pollution cuts necessary keep warming under 1.5 degrees C. Countries must cut emissions in half by 2030 and reach zero net emissions by 2050, at which point much of the remaining carbon dioxide must be scrubbed from the atmosphere.\n\nAs one pair of researchers asked, \u201cShould we avoid telling what scientists have established as facts and reasonable outlooks about the seriousness, pace and long-term commitment of climate change? Should we instead only discuss energy- and money-saving actions and convey pictures of hope by focusing on the easy actions, the \u2018doability\u2019 of mitigation? Should we perpetuate the idea that there are fifty \u2018simple ways to save the planet,\u2019 just to spare lay publics rather appropriate anxiety? Existing research suggests otherwise.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say advocates should focus exclusively on scaring people instead of inspiring them. It would be naive to think about climate change communication in binary terms. In practice, people draw on a range of emotions, values and beliefs when processing information.\n\nIn recent commentary on the role of emotion in climate change communication, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst wrote, \u201cThe bifurcation between \u2018go positive\u2019 and \u2018go negative\u2019 simultaneously oversimplifies the rich base of research on emotion while overcomplicating the very real communications challenge advocates face by demanding that each message have the right \u2018emotional recipe\u2019 to maximize effectiveness.\u201d Emotions, they explain, \u201cshould be viewed as one element of a broader, authentic communications strategy rather than as a magic bullet designed to trigger one response or another.\u201d\n\nPexels A wind turbine\n\nThe problem, Maibach said, may not be a shortage of hope or a surplus of fear, but a deficit of knowledge. Most Americans don\u2019t understand how bad climate change is or what humanity can do to stop it. As advocates explain the facts of a potentially world-ending dilemma, they must also describe specifically what can be done to address the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but not that complicated. We need to learn to walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d Maibach said.\n\n\u201cThe people and organizations who don\u2019t want America \u2014 and the world \u2014 to deal with the potentially catastrophic problem that we face tell us, over and over again, that it will cost us too much to address the problem, and it will create a future that is hardly worth living for \u2014 like living in the stone age again,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality, the exact opposite is true, but few people know it.\u201d\n\nDealing with climate change will be disruptive and difficult, but it will also create jobs and save lives. Rather than make vague allusions to \u201cclimate action,\u201d advocates might do better to argue for specific policies that will achieve these goals.\n\nSunrise Movement Advocates rally for a Green New Deal.\n\nUltimately, the idea that regular people can\u2019t be told the full implications of climate change is condescending. Scientists, writers and advocates might consider that they go to work every day understanding the enormity of climate change, and yet they are able to do their jobs. The men and women who work on climate change are not made of tougher stuff, and they need not obscure the awful truth about the carbon crisis. People can take it. In fact, they\u2019ll have to.\n\nPerhaps what makes it possible for advocates to continue their work is not a surplus of hope or an absence of fear, but a sense of duty. They respond to their grief with a righteous anger, to their panic with bravery, to their desolation with solidarity. Climate scientist Kate Marvel made this point in her recent essay in On Being.\n\n\u201cAs a climate scientist, I am often asked to talk about hope. Particularly in the current political climate, audiences want to be told that everything will be all right in the end,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no hope that these changes can be reversed. We are inevitably sending our children to live on an unfamiliar planet.\u201d In the face of climate change, she said, \u201cWe need courage, not hope. Grief, after all, is the cost of being alive. We are all fated to live lives shot through with sadness, and are not worth less for it. Courage is the resolve to do well without the assurance of a happy ending.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Michelle Obama Wore The Glittery, Thigh-High Balenciaga Boots Of Your Dreams", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-glittery-thigh-high-balenciaga-boots_us_5c1baac0e4b08aaf7a85e56b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Michelle Obama literally dazzled at her Barclays Center appearance in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday night to promote her bestselling memoir, Becoming.\n\nThe former first lady, who spoke alongside moderator Sarah Jessica Parker, wore a gorgeous, bright yellow gown from Balenciaga\u2019s spring/summer 2019 collection.

They also said the grand jury should have been shown evidence that Weinstein had exchanged friendly emails with his two accusers after the alleged attacks.\n\nProsecutors insisted their case was strong.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s defense attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said he was disappointed with Burke\u2019s ruling, but said he remains confident Weinstein will be \u201ccompletely exonerated\u201d at trial.\n\n\u201cWe intend to vigorously defend this case to the best of our ability,\u201d Brafman told reporters after the hearing. \u201cIt does not in any way suggest that the case against Mr. Weinstein is going to end badly.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. He pleaded not guilty and is free on $1 million bail. He left court without commenting.\n\nHe is charged with raping an unidentified female acquaintance in his hotel room in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.\n\nImages of Weinstein, the notoriously bombastic producer of Oscar winners \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d and \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d in handcuffs last spring were seen by many women as a cathartic moment in the #MeToo reckoning. About half a dozen women supporting Time\u2019s Up, including actresses Amber Tamblyn and Marisa Tomei, were at the hearing Thursday.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Actress Marisa Tomei attended Harvey Weinstein's court hearing Thursday to support the women who came forward with sexual assault claims against him.\n\n\u201cToday, here in New York, we saw the first steps towards justice,\u201d Time\u2019s Up President Lisa Borders said after the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nBurke could have dismissed some or all of the charges, which would have been a major setback for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who was criticized for declining to pursue criminal charges against Weinstein when he was accused of groping an Italian model in 2015. Vance cited a lack of supporting evidence at the time, despite the existence of a clandestinely made recording of Weinstein discussing the episode with the woman.\n\nBut in recent months, Weinstein worked side-by-side with Brafman to throw doubt on the case and his accusers. They plucked emails from his movie studio\u2019s servers they say showed Weinstein had friendly, consensual relationships with the women.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s defense was boosted in October by back-to-back allegations of misconduct in the police investigation.\n\nManhattan prosecutors dropped one of the charges against him \u2014 allegations that he raped an aspiring actress who was still in college \u2014 after evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio instructed a potential witness to keep some of her doubts about the veracity of the allegations to herself.\n\nDiGaudio allegedly told the witness in February that when she spoke to prosecutors, \u201cless is more.\u201d That witness never testified before the grand jury that indicted Weinstein.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nProsecutors also disclosed an allegation that DiGaudio urged the 2013 rape accuser to delete private material from her cellphones before handing them over to the DA\u2019s office.\n\nProsecutors said the material didn\u2019t pertain to Weinstein and the woman wound up not deleting anything.\n\nDiGaudio\u2019s union has said he \u201cwas simply trying to get to the truth\u201d and wasn\u2019t trying to influence the investigation.\n\nLate last month, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers said they spoke to a woman who said the rape accuser asked her to corroborate her allegations, but the friend wouldn\u2019t \u201cmake up a story.\u201d\n\nThe friend told investigators that Weinstein and the accuser had been \u201chooking up\u201d consensually for a while and that she never heard her say anything bad about him until last year, Brafman said in a court filing.\n\nIn the months after The New York Times and The New Yorker began publishing stories about Weinstein\u2019s interactions with women, activists pressured Vance to bring charges as dozens of people came forward with claims of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nNew York Police officials poured on the pressure, too, saying publicly they believed they had gathered ample evidence to make an arrest."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Ann Coulter Tore Into Trump And He Went All Passive-Aggressive With Her On Twitter", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ann-coulter-twitter-criticism_us_5c1b533de4b08aaf7a85149a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump may like to dish it out on Twitter, with seemingly no one immune from being attacked in one of his \u201cexecutive time\u201d tweetstorms.\n\nBut it seems as if the notoriously thin-skinned president can\u2019t exactly take it, if his reaction to controversial conservative pundit Ann Coulter calling him \u201cgutless\u201d for failing to deliver on his promise of constructing a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is any indication.\n\nNEW COLUMN IS POSTED!

Then Trump\u2019s press secretary issued a statement saying the president \u201cdoes not want to go further without border security,\u201d including money for the wall.\n\nTrump, who has faced rare, bitter criticism from some fellow Republicans over the past day for \u201ccaving\u201d on wall funding, was to meet with House GOP members at midday and \u201cis continuing to weigh his options,\u201d the White House statement said.\n\nAs House Republicans struggled to find the votes to pass the legislation ahead of a midnight Friday deadline, Trump started blaming GOP leaders for failing to deliver on the $5 billion he had demanded for the wall. Ryan had promised a \u201cbig fight\u201d after the midterm elections, but as Republicans lost House control, negotiations over the year-end spending bill have largely been between Trump and Democrats.\n\n\u201cI was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership,\u201d Trump tweeted shortly after calling Ryan during a morning meeting of House Republicans. \u201cWould be done by end of year (NOW). It didn\u2019t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!\u201d\n\nThe day\u2019s schedule was thrown into chaos. A morning press conference of GOP leaders was abruptly canceled as lawmakers filed out of a basement meeting to head to the floor for other matters. Voting was not set.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are in a state of disarray,\u201d said House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is poised to become speaker when Democrats take control Jan. 3. \u201cWall funding is a non-starter.\u201d\n\nThe temporary funding bill would keep government running to Feb. 8, but some House Republicans say it\u2019s better to fight for the border wall now, before they relinquish their majority to Democrats in the new year. Facing enormous criticism from high-profile conservative media figures, they don\u2019t want to leave town without one last fight over the border wall.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican and House Freedom Caucus member, said some Republicans want to \u201ccontinue to fight for wins we promised the American people we would get.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody that\u2019s ready to vote for this,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers of the hard-right Freedom Caucus have been urging Trump to insist on money for the border wall with Mexico. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the group, said Trump should veto the funding bill if it passes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of losing the vote, but I am afraid of not fighting,\u201d said Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas. \u201cThat\u2019s how this president got in. We want a secure border. It\u2019s not the time to quit.\u201d\n\nWithout a deal, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas.\n\nTrump has not indicated whether he would sign or veto the legislation if it is approved. With Pelosi\u2019s backing the bill likely has enough support to pass with votes mostly from Democratic lawmakers, who are still the minority, and some Republicans.\n\nThe White House had previously indicated that Trump was open to reviewing whatever Congress could send him. But the president did not immediately weigh in on the short-term spending plan, which would fund government past Friday\u2019s deadline to Feb. 8. The Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nTrump in an early morning tweet on Thursday had appeared to focus on other aspects of border security, and not just the wall.\n\n\u201cWith so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cRemember the Caravans? Well, they didn\u2019t get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!\u201d\n\nTrump appeared earlier in the week to shelve his shutdown threats after promising a fight over the wall, a project central to his presidential campaign. Just last week Trump said he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government over it. Some of his allies described the move as caving on his pledge and they expressed concern it could hurt Trump\u2019s 2020 prospects.\n\nMeadows said Trump\u2019s political base \u201cwill just go crazy\u201d if he signs a stopgap bill without the wall money.\n\nMeadows added on Fox News, \u201cA lot of people are very nervous this morning about whether the president will cave or not.\u201d\n\nTrump had been directing his ire at Democrats, tweeting that they were \u201cputting politics over country.\u201d\n\nThe president also put Democrats on notice Thursday about their agenda for the new year, saying he \u201cwill not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security.\u201d\n\nTrump wanted $5 billion. The bill keeps funding at current levels, $1.3 billion, for border security and fencing, but not for the wall.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said passing the stopgap funding bill would show that Republicans, still in control of the House and Senate, could finish the year by not prolonging a potential crisis.\n\nIt was unclear how many House members might return for votes. Some 70 members missed Wednesday\u2019s session, almost as many Democrats as Republicans.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York have made it clear they will not support money for Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nSchumer said Democrats oppose Trump\u2019s border demands because the wall is \u201cinefficient\u201d and because Trump, as a candidate, promised that Mexico would pay for it, which Mexico has refused to do.\n\n\u201cWe want smart, effective border security,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a wall.\u201d\n\nCongress did pass legislation to fund much of the government through the current budget year, until next Oct. 1.\n\nAt issue in the current fight is money for nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests.\n\nMany agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, are covered for the year and would continue to operate as usual.

Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, speaks during a meeting of the committee as it considers the bipartisan farm bill in June.\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) praised the rule \u2015 even though in a previous interview with HuffPost, he said such a regulation, which had been rumored, would be unacceptable.\n\n\u201cIt would not be satisfactory to the House,\u201d Conaway said in October. \u201cWe have to change the law.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of current law that has rankled Republicans is that states can waive the work rules in small geographic areas as long as the unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national rate. That means a state can exempt SNAP recipients living in counties with 4.8 percent unemployment if the national rate is 4 percent.\n\nThe proposed regulation would keep the 20 percent exemption but only if the local jobless rate is above 7 percent, according to a USDA fact sheet. The House version of the farm bill had the same provision, as well as at least a couple of other changes in the regulation, such as disallowing states from waiving the rules in areas that might include pockets of lower joblessness.\n\nThe new rule does not include the House farm bill\u2019s more stringent provisions, which would have applied work requirements to some parents of minor children who are currently exempt.\n\nIf the rule is finalized \u2015 a process that generally takes months \u2015 it would cut off food assistance for hundreds of thousands of people, said Bob Greenstein, director of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\u201cHaving failed to secure these harmful changes in the bipartisan farm bill that Congress just completed, the administration is now moving to implement them through administrative action,\u201d Greenstein said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Women Often Can\u2019t Afford Tampons, Pads In Federal Prisons.

Its justice reforms include the requirement that federal prisons give out free tampons and pads to inmates.\n\nWhile in prison, Topeka K. Sam developed blood clots so severe that when she got her period, she bled through her sanitary pads. Sam desperately needed something more absorbent, which wasn\u2019t available in the commissary. She was told to put her blood-soaked sanitary napkin into a bag and bring it to a male staff member, who would decide whether she could get a thicker pad.\n\n\u201cIt was horrifying,\u201d said Sam, now director of dignity at #cut50, a group that works to reduce prison populations. \u201cMy anxiety levels would go up every time I had to go ask. Just all the shame comes with that.\u201d\n\nIt took five months for Sam to be granted access to the pads she needed.\n\nBut heavy-duty pads weren\u2019t the only menstrual hygiene products that were tough to get. In the real world, tampons and pads are expensive. In prison, they\u2019re exorbitantly priced, especially for those earning $5 a month. In federal prison, two tampons cost $5.55. A pair of panty liners go for $1.35. Further, prisons limit the number of pads and tampons that inmates can buy. Some institutions offer these items for free, but they usually don\u2019t supply enough.\n\nA 2015 study by the Correctional Association of New York found that 54 percent of women in prison said they do not get enough sanitary pads.\n\nSam watched helplessly as other inmates also suffered. Some women walked around in stained jumpsuits. Others fashioned pads out of socks. Some used their weekly allotment of tissues and stuffed them in their underwear.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re incarcerated doesn\u2019t mean your human dignity should be taken away,\u201d said Sam, who also founded a Bronx, New York, nonprofit called Hope House, which provides housing and support to formerly incarcerated women.\n\nTopeka K.

On Tuesday night, the Senate passed a sweeping criminal justice reform bill, called the First Step Act. The bulk of the legislation focuses on such headline-making issues as shortened prison sentences, opioid addiction and recidivism rates. But it\u2019s the slim, three-sentence section toward the end of the bill, titled \u201cHealthcare Products,\u201d that\u2019s giving women\u2019s rights activists cause to celebrate.\n\nThe act requires all federal prisons to provide quality pads and tampons free to inmates.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support on Tuesday evening, 87-12. It got expected backing from such progressives as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), and won support from hard-line Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The House is likely to pass the measure soon and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\n\u201cThis is a big win for criminal justice reform,\u201d said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, author of Periods Gone Public and the women and democracy fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. \u201cIt\u2019s also a win for women and women\u2019s health. Our needs are being taken seriously in this particular context.\u201d\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images The First Step Act passed with broad bipartisan support on Tuesday evening, 87-12. It was backed by progressives, such as Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), and hard-line Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe legislation is part of a growing interest in making menstrual hygiene products more accessible to women who are incarcerated. In 2017, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), along with Warren and others, co-sponsored the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, which would\u2019ve required federal prisons to provide free tampons and pads to inmates. That bill hasn\u2019t progressed, but it helped put the issue on the map.\n\nSoon after, the Federal Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a memo requiring prisons to give out free tampons and pads. Critics questioned the quality of the products and how well the policy was actually being implemented.\n\nSome state prisons have since followed suit. In February, the Arizona Department of Corrections announced it would give out free tampons to inmates and would triple the amount of pads it would distribute. In April, Virginia passed a bill requiring jails to give out free tampons and pads. Two months later, New York lawmakers approved similar legislation.\n\nWhile Weiss-Wolf said she feels heartened by the newest menstrual hygiene legislation, she noted that the female federal inmate population is dwarfed by the number of women incarcerated in state prisons. Women make up 7 percent of the federal prison population, a figure that\u2019s remained steady. But the number of women incarcerated for violating state or local laws has skyrocketed since the 1970s.\n\nWeiss-Wolf said she hopes that women in federal prisons will now at least get access to more dignified treatment, and that local and state prisons will see how feasible that is."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Powerful Photos Show What Life With Depression Is Really Like", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/too-tired-project-depression-photos_us_5c1ab9d8e4b08aaf7a84a2ee", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Depression takes on many forms.

She began posting the submissions along with captions from the photographers. To date, Wray has received about 4,000 submissions from a mix of professional and amateur photographers.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a need out there for people to find a place to share their work along this topic,\u201d Wray said.\n\nAround the world, 332 million people live with depression. In 2015, 16 million adults in the U.S. experienced at least one major depressive episode. Despite how common the condition is, it affects individuals differently, says Debra Kissen, executive director of the Light on Anxiety CBT Treatment Center in Chicago. \u201cThere is not a standard external picture of what living with depression looks like,\u201d she told HuffPost. Some people experiencing depressive symptoms might have trouble going about their daily tasks; others show no outward symptoms but are consumed by feelings of despair or worthlessness, Kissen added.\n\nWray plans to keep The Too Tired Project running as long as people are willing to share their work with her. She is especially interested in inviting people of color and the LGBTQ community to share their stories. Her goal for 2020 is to compile many of the submissions into a photo book. She is also starting to host pop-up slideshows where she invites people in a designated city to submit photos to The Too Tired Project and asks them to gather for an interactive event.\n\nTara Wray\n\nWray hopes the project continues to help knock down some stigmas surrounding mental health struggles and gives people with depression an outlet to come forward.\n\n\u201cI am interested in giving photographers a chance to own the narrative around their own struggles with depression,\u201d Wray said. \u201cI really want people to come together around this idea, even if it\u2019s nothing more than saying, \u2018That photo and that story made sense to me because I\u2019m going through the same thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a means of expanding this effort, The Too Tired Project partnered with Open Path Psychotherapy Collective, which offers mental health services in all 50 states and Canada, to help pair people up with reduced-cost therapy sessions.\n\nFor many of the Too Tired Project participants, the series is an opportunity to come out of the shadows and provide a physical demonstration of the issues they deal with on a daily basis. Below, five photographers who contributed to the series share their work and what it means to them.\n\nAnonymous\n\nAnonymous\n\nOne participant, a 37-year old amateur photographer who lives in Bordeaux, France, submitted a photo of his daughter, Josephine, at 3 days old.\n\n\u201cThis is my third and last child. After tidying up the maternity ward, we were going home. I knew it was my last child, and I had a brief melancholy emotion when leaving this place,\u201d the project participant, who wished to remain anonymous due to his condition, told HuffPost. \u201cI wanted to take one last picture before leaving the maternity ward. I put this little body in this big bed.\u201d\n\nHis mission was to show how mental health struggles can seem insurmountable \u2015 like things will never change.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at my worst, it was impossible for me to imagine building a family life or anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet it is possible, I had three children and a wonderful woman who supports me every day.

The lack of my reflection in the mirror represents my struggle to find my peaceful, well-adjusted self. When will I see something different in the mirror? When will I find a clue that will help me get out of this place?\u201d\n\nGuerriero explained that her submission marked the first time she has spoken publicly about her mental health.\n\n\u201cSociety must come to understand that depression is not a choice or an intentional state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot just \u2018snap out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMatthew David Crowther\n\nMatthew David Crowther\n\nMatthew David Crowther, a Chicago photographer whose work explores self-expression, has been a big fan of Wray\u2019s work for years and found Too Tired For Sunshine to be one of the best and most honest depictions of depression in photography.

It has four primary goals: identifying lead-exposed children, reducing children\u2019s exposure to lead sources, communicating more effectively with stakeholders, and conducting research to inform these efforts.\n\n\u201cLead exposure is a calamity that disproportionately harms children in low-income communities. All Americans, regardless of their age, race, income or home address, deserve an opportunity to live in safe and healthy environments,\u201d Wheeler, co-chair of the President\u2019s Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe task force was established by executive order in 1997 and comprises 17 federal departments and offices, including the EPA and the Department of Health and Human Services. Wheeler said the plan includes specific action targeting lead in paint, drinking water, contaminated soil and consumer products before it presents a \u201cserious and urgent threat\u201d to children.\n\nBut childhood lead experts and advocates who reviewed the action plan said it falls far short of what\u2019s needed to eliminate the risk of childhood lead exposure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant step backward in progress to end lead poisoning for children in the United States,\u201d said attorney and health justice scholar Emily Benfer, a visiting associate clinical professor of law at Columbia University Law School who directs the health justice advocacy clinic.\n\nThis task force is talking about simply reducing exposure and not taking any concrete steps to actually make that happen. And without a dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s really just talk. Emily Benfer, Columbia University Law School\n\nThe task force\u2019s 2016 report included primary prevention, environmental justice, and the elimination of lead poisoning, but none of those themes are included in the current action plan, Benfer said, noting it doesn\u2019t use the word \u201celiminate\u201d at all.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, the task force said that the goal was to eliminate lead poisoning and to realize environmental justice especially for high-risk communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThis task force is talking about simply reducing exposure and not taking any concrete steps to actually make that happen. And without a dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s really just talk.\u201d\n\nBenfer is particularly concerned that the plan often mentions the task force\u2019s intent to evaluate or re-evaluate lead contamination issues that have already been studied, researched and widely understood in the scientific community as being harmful to human health.\n\nFor example, the dangers of lead in aviation fuel, the single largest source of lead in the air, said Benfer, is an issue that requires action, not more evaluation, to protect children in low-income communities who are most affected by ambient air pollution.\n\nThe action plan even recommends more evaluation of the blood lead reference level at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends public health intervention for children. The CDC has already concluded that no level of lead in children is safe, and may reduce the reference level from 5 to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter based on scientific recommendations.\n\n\u201cSo while they\u2019re busy considering and exploring \u2014 those are the themes of the report \u2014 how many millions more children are going to suffer from the permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning?\u201d Benfer asked.\n\n\u201cThis really doesn\u2019t advance lead poisoning prevention in any way,\u201d she added.\n\nTAE-GYUN KIM/ASSOCIATED PRESS An empty playground at Carrie Gosch Elementary School, which was closed due to lead contamination near the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana. The town's mayor ordered the evacuation of the housing complex because of severe lead contamination, forcing more than 1,000 people from their homes.\n\nRuth Ann Norton, president and chief executive officer of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative in Baltimore, commended the task force for producing a comprehensive report and for emphasizing the urgency of taking action to address what she described as one of the most tragic and costly environmental diseases in the United States.\n\nBut the plan is too broad, she said, and lacks details on one of the most important questions to implement the strategy: funding.\n\n\u201cThey clearly support the fact that lead is an entirely preventable and winnable issue ... but it does not address the most urgent, pressing need, which is the capital investment to eliminate this issue,\u201d Norton told HuffPost.\n\nThe action plan is not a budget document and notes that all of its activities are \u201csubject to budgetary constraints, interagency processes, stakeholder input and other approvals.\u201d This includes how the Trump administration weighs priorities and available resources, and how Congress appropriates funding, it explains.\n\nAlthough blood lead levels in U.S. children have dropped dramatically in the last 30 years, lead continues to plague communities across the country, particularly low-income neighborhoods. Approximately half a million U.S. children in the United States have blood lead levels above the level at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends intervention.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, Erik Olson, senior director of health and food for the international nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, also criticized the action plan for failing to commit to regulatory or enforcement action.\n\n\u201cLead is one of our most toxic pollutants, and it\u2019s in our air, waters and lands. And children are our most vulnerable population. Given this administration\u2019s abysmal track record on protecting public health, we remain skeptical,\u201d Olson said in a statement from NRDC.\n\nThe plan outlines that the EPA will consider revisions to lead dust hazard standards from paint, as appropriate. But Olson points out that the agency is under a court order to strengthen outdated lead hazard standards by July 2019.\n\n\u201c\u2018Considering\u2019 complying with a court order doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d wrote Olson.\n\nHe noted that the EPA\u2019s July 2018 proposal on lead paint dust hazard standards did tighten the standards, but not as much as public health experts have recommended.\n\n'Considering\u2019 complying with a court order doesn\u2019t cut it. Erik Olson, Natural Resources Defense Council\n\nOlson also took issue with the types of stakeholders involved in the process to revise the EPA\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, which the agency had proposed to strengthen by December 2017, then delayed to spring 2019.\n\nThe rule, which hasn\u2019t been updated in more than two decades, establishes the guidelines for how local jurisdictions must manage their water systems to reduce lead and copper pipe contamination.\n\nThe task force says it plans to move forward on the rule with input from \u201cfrom state, tribal, and local partners.\u201d But Olson points out that public health advocates, environmental groups and others aren\u2019t explicitly mentioned.\n\nExperts also recommend primary prevention to eliminate environmental hazards at the source. The task force\u2019s goals, however, place an emphasis on identifying lead-exposed children, which is the opposite of primary prevention, said Benfer.\n\n\u201cThey talk about the need to facilitate follow-up blood lead level testing and monitoring but they disregard the fact that the majority of states require zero intervention until lead levels are past 10, 15, 20 even 45 micrograms per deciliter,\u201d said Benfer. \u201cSo without this widespread effort to really provide guidance with the goal of primary prevention, we\u2019re going to continue placing children in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nNorton, with the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative in Maryland, says the elimination of lead poisoning through primary prevention, universal blood testing and other concrete steps is achievable in five years but would require an investment of $12.5 billion over a five-year period. Her organization published a 2016 report that outlines a strategy to marshal the financial resources to end childhood lead exposure.\n\nIn the long run, spending this money to prevent lead exposure will save the nation more than $250 billion over five years, Norton said, noting that the United States spends approximately $50 billion every year on the avoidable cost of treating hundreds of thousands of poisoned and lead-exposed children.\n\n\u201cThe realities are that we are paying a price for a toxic legacy that has impaired the opportunities of American children for generations, and most especially African-American children, at an alarming and unacceptable rate and continues to do so,\u201d Norton said.\n\nUltimately, health justice scholars such as Benfer say the task force has ignored the best practice recommendations and advice of experts, advocates and affected community members.\n\n\u201cThe task force had an unparalleled opportunity to lead a coordinated national effort to eliminate lead poisoning and protect future generations from the neurotoxin, and it punted,\u201d said Benfer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Here's What You Need To Know About Facebook's Colossally Bad Year", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-2018-privacy-data_us_5c1a6812e4b01059bfc610e4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "In November, Facebook admitted that it hired a Republican opposition research firm to dig up dirt on billionaire philanthropist and prominent Democratic donor George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitic, right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nThe social media giant enlisted the help of Definers Public Affairs last year, initially for tracking media coverage, after widespread criticism of the way Facebook largely dismissed its role in spreading misinformation campaigns during the 2016 election.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Demanding Wall Funding, Trump Balks at Bill to Avert Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/trump-government-shutdown.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A deal to avert a Christmastime government shutdown teetered on Thursday after President Trump told House Republican leaders he would not sign a stopgap spending bill if it does not include border-wall funding.
