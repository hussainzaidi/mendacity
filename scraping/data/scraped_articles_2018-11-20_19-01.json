In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"\n\nLess than an hour after releasing the statement, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden to pardon two turkeys for Thanksgiving. He did not mention the journalist's murder.\n\nThe President's statement sets up a clash with lawmakers from both parties who have called for harsh measures against Saudi Arabia and have expressed deep reservations about US support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. It once again pits Trump against his intelligence agencies and bolsters a regime that has admitted to killing a vocal critic and member of the press.\n\nTrump is expected to receive a CIA assessment on Khashoggi's murder later on Tuesday.\n\nHigh confidence\n\nA senior administration official told CNN that the report, delivered in physical form, is an assessment of all the intelligence gathered so far, but will not present a final conclusion. That's in keeping with intelligence community practice: agencies assign a confidence level to their findings because intelligence isn't conclusive.\n\nAnd though sources tell CNN that the CIA has assessed with high confidence that the prince directed Khashoggi's murder, which was conducted by members of the prince's inner circle, the fact that they don't make a final conclusion gives the White House an out.\n\nThe statement and the expected CIA report come seven weeks after the father of four entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to seek marriage documents. Trump was briefed by CIA Director Gina Haspel, who traveled to Turkey to meet with officials there about their findings and allegedly heard a recording the Turkish government had made of the killing.\n\nSaudi Arabia initially insisted the Virginia resident left its consulate, but after a few weeks in which its story constantly shifted, officials admitted in late October that the murder was premeditated and was conducted by a group of 15 men from various government agencies and some from the prince's closest circle of advisors.\n\nJUST WATCHED Who does Trump believe in journalist's death?

Saudi officials have said that the team was sent to convince the journalist to return to Saudi Arabia and that he was mistakenly killed with an overdose meant to temporarily subdue him. It is still not clear where Khashoggi's body is or what happened to it.\n\nWhile Riyadh has maintained that neither the crown prince nor his father knew of the operation, intelligence officials, lawmakers and analysts familiar with the country have assessed that an operation of this nature and scale could not happen without the direction and awareness of the crown prince, who controls all the country's security services.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and strong Trump supporter, told NBC on Sunday that the team of 15 \"don't get on two airplanes, go to Turkey and chop a guy up in a consulate who is a critic of the crown prince without the crown prince having known about it. And sanctioned it.\"\n\n'Worst cover-up ever'\n\nSaudi Arabia announced last week that 11 men had been indicted for the \"rogue operation\" and that five would face the death penalty.\n\nTrump, who derided the Saudi explanations as \"the worst cover-up ever\" in late October, made clear in his statement that his view on the killing is transactional.\n\nCiting promised Saudi investment in the US that could generate jobs and military contracts worth billions, even as he inflated their worth, Trump said that \"if we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Read Trump's statement on Saudi crown prince", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/-MCykig5UdQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nNovember 20, 2018\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia\n\nAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq's fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" Iran is considered \"the world's leading sponsor of terror.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \"enemy of the state\" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that -- this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels -- so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\n###"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump has doubts over journalist's death", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/18oXkLpNChg/jamal-khashoggi-donald-trump-saudi-arabia-marquardt-dnt-lead-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump says he will get a full report on the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but as CNN's Alexander Marquardt reports, it seems Trump is already laying the groundwork to side with the Saudi Crown Prince over US intelligence."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump says he won't listen to Khashoggi recording", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Ka8Hzfp2MiY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said he declined to listen to a recording that captured part of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, calling it \"a suffering tape\" and \"terrible.\"\n\nIn an interview released on Sunday, Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he doesn't have any interest in hearing the tape, which contains audio of the killing of Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in early October.\n\n\"Have you, one, either heard the tape yourself or been briefed on it, and if so, to your mind what does it show?\" Wallace asked Trump.\n\n\"We have the tape, I don't want to hear the tape, no reason for me to hear the tape,\" Trump replied.\n\n\"Why don't you want to hear it, sir?\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: Trump is too fragile to hear what really happened", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Usev1dfO9eo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The fiction that Donald Trump is a \"counter-puncher\" is getting a workout as his defenders try to justify the President's attacks on everyone from US Rep. Adam Schiff (\"little Adam Schitt\") to the special counsel Robert Mueller (\"gone absolutely nuts.\") The myth holds that Trump is a tough guy who fights back. In fact, he is a fragile man running out of safe places to hide.\n\nLike so much about Trump, the counter-puncher theme is a clever marketing ploy used to obscure obvious flaws. In the past he promoted himself as a business titan to cover the shame of multiple massive bankruptcies. Today, as a politician, he poses as a victim when he's actually a frightened bully. No one is ever on equal footing with the President of the United States, which means that whenever he \"punches\" anyone, he lowers himself.\n\nWho does Trump fear? He fears the independent counsel, whose investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election threatens to expose the inner workings of the campaign and of Trump's opaque business empire. He fears Schiff and other House Democrats he's belittled because they will soon chair powerful committees that will launch their own investigations into Trump's administration and, perhaps, his long-hidden tax returns.\n\nThe President's insecurities all seem to revolve around his fear of being unmasked as a fraud. The tax returns, for example, would allow everyone to compare his claims to great wealth -- in 2015 he said he was worth $10 billion -- with black-and-white reality. More to the point, we could all see how he has benefited from various tax maneuvers and discover just how much corporate welfare the Trump Organization has lapped up over the years.\n\nBeyond his finances, Trump fears being revealed to be a na\u00eff who has been outplayed by others with power. In the case of the Saudi killing of American-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump seems afraid to listen to the audio evidence Turkish officials handed over to the United States. He seems to be in denial about what his brutal pals are willing to do.\n\nTrump's first overseas trip as President began with a stop in Riyadh, where he joined in a ceremonial dance and went all in with one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.\n\nThe desperation in Trump's denial, whether it has to do with Khashoggi's killing or domestic politics, can be seen in the tortured effort he makes to persuade us that what we see with our own eyes isn't true.\n\nThe results of the 2018 election are a perfect case in point. Trump's instinct brought him to frame the election as a \"tremendous success,\" even as his party lost control of the House and he became vulnerable to the opposition for the first time in his presidency.\n\nTrump likely failed to detect the nation's displeasure with him, and his party, because he is apparently afraid to go anywhere outside the parts of the country where he's sure to draw an adoring crowd. (His did make a brief trip to California after the campaign in the wake of the deadly wildfires.)\n\nThe America he saw at his rallies was whiter, more rural and less educated than America overall. Obviously wary of any place where he wouldn't be hailed as a hero, he didn't hold a single rally in the Northeast or on the West Coast. In both those regions, Republicans suffered major election losses. If timid Trump had taken the risk of going to these places, he might have had a more realistic sense of how he is faring. But information that runs counter to the narrative he prefers may make him uncomfortable.\n\nJUST WATCHED Berman: The President is a counter-puncher Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Berman: The President is a counter-puncher 02:55\n\nThe President's need for safe spaces is not just a matter of campaign strategy. In March, USA Today noted that Trump had seen less of the country than any president in 40 years. Whenever possible Trump has traveled to his own properties -- the Mar-a-Lago resort is a favorite -- where he can surround himself with sycophants, rest in his own comfy bed and tweet insults at the people he fears.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that Trump \"has spoken privately about his fears over risks to his own life, according to a former senior White House official.\" The unnamed official said, \"He's afraid of those situations. He's afraid people want to kill him.\"\n\nA bit of concern would be natural, but as the ultimate VIP, a president who goes to Iraq or Afghanistan, for example, should not tremble. (Obama went to both in his first 14 months in office.) But like any man who brags about how much he loves to fight, Trump long ago revealed himself to be a fearful fellow. Face to face with real combat troops he might be confronted with actual courage and feel diminished\n\nComfort is prized by our fragile-flower President, who spins fantasies of denial to avoid painful realities. His recent interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News was a frightened fantasist's tour de force. \"I did well in France,\" he says after a trip where he skipped a ceremony to honor the war dead because, he claims, fog kept his helicopter grounded and the Secret Service forbade him to travel by car. In fact, the Secret Service cannot order a president to do anything, and other heads of state made the trek to honor the dead.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

In one column for the Washington Post he called on Saudi Arabia to \"use its clout and leverage within Western circles\" to resolve the conflict.\n\nNever could he have imagined that he himself would become the leverage in attempts to end the war.\n\nUS President Donald Trump seems reluctant to connect Mohammed bin Salman to the journalist's death, appearing to take little note of what sources say is a CIA assessment that the powerful Saudi Crown Prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTrump has distanced himself from the case as much as he can, refusing to listen to audio evidence shedding light on how Khashoggi was killed last month at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Saudi officials now admit a premeditated murder happened on its diplomatic premises, though it denies the Crown Prince was involved.\n\nDespite the CIA assessment, Trump has repeatedly explained the Saudi-US relationship is simply too important to risk.\n\nBut Trump isn't the only world leader who wants to avoid a direct clash with bin Salman and rock a strategic relationship that comes with the perks of intelligence sharing, lucrative arms deals and a stable supply of oil. And it wouldn't be the first time the world has turned a blind eye to human rights violations by the kingdom to preserve these creature comforts in a restive region.\n\nInstead, Western nations are responding to Saudi aggression by addressing the war in Yemen, ratcheting up pressure on the Crown Prince to enter a ceasefire agreement that will put an end to the three-year conflict.\n\nThe war in Yemen, between the US-backed Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-backed Houthis, has created the world's worst man-made humanitarian disaster, according to the UN. Much of the damage has come from Saudi coalition air power, and UN experts say its bombing of civilians are potential war crimes. The Saudis, who have denied allegations of war crimes, have the greatest power to end the conflict, above any other actor in the war.\n\nThere are plenty of members of Congress in the US who don't agree with Trump's lax response to the Khashoggi killing. A bipartisan group of Senators has introduced draft legislation to impose tougher sanctions on Saudi Arabia that target arms sales to the kingdom and bans the US practice of refueling of Saudi planes in the Yemen war.\n\n\"This legislation is an important way to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for various acts in Yemen as well as the death of Jamal Khashoggi,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said last week\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake accused the Trump administration of dragging its feet on the Khashoggi case in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" In the same breath, he brought up the Saudi role in Yemen as another example of how the kingdom's and US' values do not align.\n\n\"It looks more and more like the truth is that the Crown Prince was involved, that he likely ordered it,\" Flake said of the Khashoggi killing.\n\n\"So, to just deflect and say it's a spectacular ally, when, in fact, some of the bloom has been coming off that rose for a while, particularly given the war in Yemen. So, there are things that we're going to have to confront here soon. And I hope we do it based on the truth, not in something that we simply want to see because we have a lot invested in the relationship with the Crown Prince now.\"\n\nJoost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa program director at the International Crisis Group, said that Khashoggi's murder coincided with a growing willingness to address the Yemen war, particularly as hunger worsens in the country and ahead of a possible announcement at the end of the month that Yemen is officially in famine.\n\n\"There was growing unease and pressure from governments, civil society groups and others to do more to end this conflict. Everybody realized that the responsibility of a famine would shift to them too,\" Hiltermann said.\n\n\"But people are always looking for opportunities, there's always an opportunity in a crisis. Even when someone gets murdered in a horrific way, there's political capital to be made.\"\n\nYemen resolution picks up steam\n\nWestern nations have pounced on Riyadh's rare moment of vulnerability to push for progress on Yemen, an easier cause to sell politically at home than tussling with the powerful Crown Prince.\n\nThe UK was expected to table a long-awaited draft UN resolution on Yemen during a meeting of the Security Council in New York on Monday.\n\nA week ago, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visited Riyadh, where he met with bin Salman and presented him with the draft text that sources said provoked anger.\n\nTwo sources told CNN the Crown Prince \"threw a fit\" over the resolution. Two other sources described his reaction less dramatically, but didn't deny he was at the very least annoyed.\n\nAnother source told CNN that Hunt went to bin Salman and essentially said: \"This is what Western powers think, and this is what you need to do. What is your plan to stop this?\"\n\nHunt's trip followed discussions with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, suggesting the Western allies are on the same page on the resolution.\n\nAnd it seems the plan has already had some success; the Saudis have now agreed to facilitate Houthi negotiators' travel to Sweden for talks.\n\nIn a small first gesture, the US earlier this month halted its practice of refueling Saudi coalition jets operating in Yemen. Around the same time, Pompeo and US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis also called on participants in the conflict to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nBut the concern is that the renewed vigor for action on Yemen -- however desperately welcomed it may be -- has come at the cost of disclosing the full truth on Khashoggi.\n\nJUST WATCHED Symbolic funeral prayers held for journalist Replay More Videos ...

It sparked public outrage, prompted an investigation and led to calls for reform.\n\nBut the misplaced gun debacle was hardly an isolated incident, according to documents recently obtained by CNN.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration's Office of Inspection has documented more than 200 cases of air marshals allegedly misusing firearms or misbehaving with guns between roughly 2005 and 2017, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe cases ranged from seemingly mundane issues, such as improper storage of weapons, to situations in which air marshals allegedly jeopardized public safety.\n\nIn 19 of the cases, air marshals allegedly fired their weapons accidentally. For example, the documents state that in 2017 an agent based in Charlotte, North Carolina, \"unintentionally discharged a personally owned firearm resulting in a gunshot wound to his right foot.\"\n\nA 2013 case described an air marshal mistakenly firing his weapon inside a hotel room and damaging a television in an adjoining room.\n\nMore than 70 of the incidents relate to lost, misplaced or stolen weapons. At least three of those cases involved air marshals forgetting their firearms in airplane bathrooms. Two others involved weapons misplaced in airports.\n\nOn one occasion, an air marshal allegedly left his gun inside a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Totowa, New Jersey. In another, an investigation was launched after police found a \"range bag\" containing a gun box and ammunition in a school park.\n\nAt least 13 of the cases involved alcohol, including a 2012 case in which an armed air marshal allegedly flew on a plane while drunk and another in 2014 in which an agent was accused of being intoxicated during a firearms training session.\n\nThe TSA touts federal air marshals as elite officers who receive extensive firearms training that surpasses the standards within many other law enforcement agencies. In a statement to CNN, Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for the air marshals, said the cases involved less than 1% of its workforce.\n\n\"All reports of misconduct are taken seriously and fully investigated. When those investigations validate any misconduct, TSA takes swift disciplinary actions,\" said Kelly, who added, \"we are proud of the highly skilled and trained Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) who keep our skies safe every day.\"\n\nThe documents from TSA's Office of Inspection, which audits and inspects TSA operations, do not stipulate whether the allegations of misconduct were substantiated, or whether the air marshals involved were disciplined. The records also did not identify the employees by name.\n\nTSA has investigated 35 incidents in which air marshals were alleged to have unintentionally or inappropriately discharged or brandished weapons between 2007 and 2017. Of those, 27 incidents were substantiated and resulted in disciplinary action, while eight were cleared with no action taken.\n\nTSA did not share the number and outcome of investigations of other types of alleged misconduct involving firearms described in the documents.\n\nHow the cases compare to rates of misconduct with firearms within other law enforcement agencies is unclear because the total number of air marshals is classified. However, former air marshals say any mishap with a firearm is unacceptable because of the unique sensitivity of aviation security.\n\n\"When you're in an airport around thousands of people or in an airplane that's essentially a small tube 30,000 feet in the air, you have to be incredibly accurate. You can't make mistakes,\" said Henry Preston, a former air marshal and training instructor who retired in 2014.\n\nPreston and four other former air marshals reached by CNN said they observed inconsistencies in \"recurrent training\" during their time with the Federal Air Marshal Service, such as disagreements among instructors on how to enforce marksmanship and safety standards.\n\nAir marshals are required to undergo recurrent training that includes quarterly marksmanship evaluations and annual off-range safety courses, but a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found the air marshal service did not have complete and timely data on the extent to which its officers completed that training. Kelly, the air marshal spokesman, said TSA has implemented the GAO's recommendations on how to better evaluate air marshal training.\n\nThree of the cases in the documents obtained by CNN related to misconduct during firearms training.\n\nIn 2013, for example, an air marshal instructor \"committed egregious safety violations\" by allegedly throwing a handful of expired simulation ammunition into an open fire during a training exercise, according to the records. The ammunition exploded and flying debris hit one staff member in the face, the documents state.\n\nDaniel Kowal, a current supervisory air marshal and section chief at the agency's training facility near Atlantic City, New Jersey, said that while any case of misconduct is embarrassing, the Federal Air Marshal Service prides itself on rigorous firearms training and strives for zero errors.\n\n\"When we hear incidents like this, we immediately convene a panel to address them and we look at what was the underlying cause, what happened, if and when the training failed, how and why did it fail, and how do we plug that gap,\" Kowal said.\n\nIn addition to recurrent training, all air marshals must first go through a 16-week training course that starts with basic law enforcement techniques, taught in New Mexico, and ends with more advanced weapons-handling and other skills taught at the Atlantic City facility, where CNN observed training in action.\n\nKowal said air marshals must achieve a minimum marksmanship score of 255 out of 300, which he described as the highest firearms qualification standard in federal law enforcement, and he said air marshals have an average individual score of about 283.\n\nBrian Borek, who represents air marshals as agency president at the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, told CNN some field offices do an excellent job with recurrent training, while disparities exist at others because of limitations on size, resources and personnel. He said that doesn't make them less effective, \"just different and limited.\"\n\n\"These challenges are not unique to FAMS agency, however. This exists at all large-scale organizations. This in no way translates to the readiness or skill set of air marshals. They are the best in the world,\" Borek said.\n\nThe incidents of misconduct with firearms adds to a history of controversies that have plagued the Federal Air Marshal Service. Several former air marshals reached by CNN said that in addition to inconsistencies in recurrent training, grueling hours, low morale and even alcoholism affect the mission-readiness of many air marshals.\n\n\"There are systemic problems within the culture that affect the men and women doing the job,\" said Clay Biles, a former air marshal who wrote a book about the agency, titled \"Unsecure Skies.\"\n\nIn 2012, a commissioned study conducted by the Division of Sleep Medicine of Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School found that 75% of air marshals flying domestic missions were sleep-deficient. The study stated air marshals suffering from fatigue have increased risk of \"self-injury\" and \"greater incidence of serious errors.\"\n\nIn 2015, CNN reported that 10 federal air marshals had killed themselves since 2002, and representatives of the Air Marshal Association said job stress contributed to those deaths. At least two of the cases in the TSA Office of Inspection documents obtained by CNN involved alleged suicides by air marshals.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April that the TSA has had to monitor whether air marshals show up for their flights sober. The TSA said its Office of Inspection makes quality assurance visits to ensure mission readiness.\n\nSome government reports have indicated money spent on some air marshal programs would be more effective in funding other forms of aviation security. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that the air marshal service's \"contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable.\"\n\nA document obtained by CNN in August showed a TSA proposal to reduce the federal air marshal program that would save the agency nearly $39 million per year.\n\nJohn Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University who has assessed the efficiencies of various forms of aviation security, argues that the costs of air marshals outweigh their benefits. He recommends training and arming more pilots to resist hijackers and adding secondary cockpit barriers.\n\nReferring to air marshals, Mueller said, \"They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them. There are much less expensive security measures, which could replace them and save lots of money.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A police officer and two employees were killed in Chicago hospital shooting", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/axAkx1Yy2vU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Chicago (CNN) A police officer, a doctor and a pharmacy resident were killed after a Monday afternoon shooting at Chicago's Mercy Hospital, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said.\n\nThe shooting was a domestic incident, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said. The gunman's first victim was a woman with whom he had had a relationship, Johnson said.\n\nThe gunman, Juan Lopez, 32, also died, police said. It is unclear whether he died from police gunfire or a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Johnson said.\n\nMercy Hospital named its employees killed in the shooting as Tamara O'Neal, 38, an emergency room physician, and pharmacy resident Dayna Less, 25, a recent graduate of Purdue University.\n\nThe hospital paid tribute to police and security staff, saying it was \"deeply saddened by the tragedy.\"\n\n\"Every shooting in America is a tragedy, and it is especially senseless when a shooting occurs in the healing space of a hospital,\" it said in a statement.\n\nChicago police identified the deceased officer as Samuel Jimenez, a father of three. He joined the force in February 2017 and recently completed probationary training, becoming a full-fledged officer, Johnson said. A procession was held for him Monday night.\n\n\"Today, we mourn Chicago Police Officer Samuel Jimenez. His heroic actions saved countless lives. He ran toward danger. He ran toward those shots.

As they started arguing, a friend of the woman attempted to intervene.\n\nThe gunman lifted his shirt and revealed a handgun, prompting the friend to flee. Two 911 calls in rapid succession reported an assault and then gunshots, Johnson said.\n\nWhen officers responded to the scene, the gunman opened fire on them before they could exit their vehicle. Officers followed him into the hospital and exchanged gunfire with him, Johnson said.\n\nDuring the shootout, Jimenez was fatally wounded along with a hospital employee as she exited an elevator.\n\nThe officers \"saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he was prepared to do,\" Johnson said.\n\n'I don't even have words'\n\nPolice secured the hospital and patients are safe, the hospital said.\n\nChicago police say Monday's shooting began in a parking lot at Mercy Hospital.\n\nThe shooting drew large numbers of law enforcement and emergency responders. Vehicles with flashing lights cordoned off the blocks around the medical center.\n\nWitness Steven White told CNN he was in the emergency room when he saw the shooter firing at police.\n\n\"We heard some shots so we all ran to the emergency window; we see this guy out there, military style, shooting at the police -- pow, pow, pow,\" he said.\n\nWhen White looked outside he said he saw a person lying on the ground by the main entrance. The shooter turned around and opened fire again before running inside that entrance.\n\n\"I don't even have words to say how I was feeling,\" White said. \"It's sad, you can't even come to the hospital for treatment.\"\n\nAt least 15 medic units were sent to Mercy Hospital, Chicago Fire Department public information officer Larry Merritt said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois thanked law enforcement members for their response.\n\n\"My heart is with Mercy Hospital in Chicago tonight.

They had moved to Paradise seven months ago and were still unpacking.\n\n\"One thing we learned is having all our important documents and photos on hard drives. They happened to be all in one location,\" Clunies-Ross told CNN. \"That's what saved that stuff.\"\n\nSome of the family's clothes and their toiletries were already packed, left from a trip to Oregon the week before. Having some essentials ready gave Clunies-Ross the time to pack her medications.\n\nWhen she got to her closet, she started at her clothes. She didn't know what to take or how to pack them. She left them hanging there.\n\n\"I think in crisis you don't have the brain power to make any sense of anything.

I was just on the verge of losing it,\" she said.\n\nShe had sent her husband and two children on their way in the other car, as she was on call at the hospital, she said. She still hadn't received an alert to evacuate.\n\nThe 39-year-old made several trips to her car and noticed the fire was spreading quickly. A fire had appeared in her front lawn and the next time she looked, a man came out of nowhere and put it out for her.\n\nA few framed photos, her daughter's stuffed bunny and some of her husband's favorite vintage T-shirts also made it out.\n\nTheir home, made of cedar, didn't make it. \"It looks like a house was never there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad I have my family,\" she said. \"At the same time, nothing else really matters in the mix of it all.

Her friend from the Red Cross told her she should start getting ready to go. Nervous, her 20-year-old daughter pleaded for them to pack.\n\nShe gathered her passport and important documents and told her daughter they'd pack up a few things and assess the situation in the morning.\n\nIn the middle of the night, more alerts came -- the fire was coming at the 10-acre property from two directions, she said.\n\nStanwood Terranova's house was more than a home -- it was also her business and a retreat center she called a \"sacred place.\" She's a licensed spiritual counselor.\n\nShe sent her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend on their way and spent one hour going through the house and property. She opened the property's gates so firefighters could enter, packed items and she blessed each room of the house.\n\nStanwood Terranova stood in front of her library, asking herself what she couldn't live without. She took her two favorite books that she teaches from, each one filled with notes in the margins. Right above those, she reached for the many journals she's kept over the past 20 to 30 years, as well as the ones she wrote for her two children.\n\nShe took her computers, the start of the book she's been writing and all her business contacts.\n\nShe forgot to take any clothes with her, having to purchase some after she evacuated. She left a \"beautiful necklace sitting on the counter,\" but said she didn't care.\n\nHer two bull mastiffs, Brando and Juliet, were the first thing she loaded in the car and then came whatever else there was room for. Otherwise there wasn't much. \"I truly thought I was coming home,\" she said.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m., she evacuated for Ojai.\n\nShe later found out her home and business were destroyed by the fire.

He managed to find and save his cat, Kobe, before heading out.\n\nThe 63-year-old grabbed what he could, but he knew he had another stop to make: his granddaughter's school. He managed to save her family's dog, LC, from their home after that.\n\nBartek wishes he would have remembered to grab his wedding rings. The retiree is engaged and the wedding is set for February. The homemade wedding decorations were lost in the fire, as was his entire house.\n\nBartek described the scene outside as he evacuated as \"Armageddon.

Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia\n\nAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq's fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" Iran is considered \"the world's leading sponsor of terror.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \"enemy of the state\" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that -- this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels -- so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm.

Tigar of the US District Court for the Northern District of California said that a policy announced November 9 barring asylum for immigrants who enter outside a legal check point '\"irreconcilably conflicts\" with immigration law and the \"expressed intent of Congress.\"\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the President's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" Tigar wrote, adding that asylum seekers would be put at \"increased risk of violence and other harms at the border\" if the administration's rule is allowed to go into effect.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department slammed the ruling and the lawsuit, calling them both \"absurd.\"\n\n\"Our asylum system is broken, and it is being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year. ... It is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled,\" Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldeman and Justice Department spokesman Steven Stafford said in a statement.\n\nThe temporary restraining order is effective nationwide and will remain in effect until December 19, when the judge has scheduled another hearing, or further order of the court.\n\nThe order is the latest setback for the administration that has sought to crack down on what it says are flaws in the immigration system, and it is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups who argued it is illegal to block someone based on how they entered the country.\n\nNow a key question looms: What impact will the judge's decision have in the coming days at the US-Mexico border, where Trump has deployed thousands of troops as large groups of migrants seeking asylum head toward the United States?\n\nMore than 2,000 Central American migrants arrived in the border city of Tijuana in recent days, and about 3,000 more migrants are estimated to be in Mexicali, Mexico, another border city about 100 miles away, UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman Francesca Fontanini said.\n\nIn recent days, administration officials have maintained that there is a crisis at the border and that abuses in asylum claims forced them implement new measures.\n\nImmigrant rights groups, who argue the administration is creating a crisis at the border to score political points, praised the judge's ruling.\n\n\"This is a critical step in fighting back against President Trump's war on asylum seekers,\" said Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIn their lawsuit, immigrants advocates argued it was illegal to block someone from seeking asylum based on how they entered the country, and that the Trump administration also violated the Administrative Procedure Act by not providing public notice or comment on its new asylum rule.\n\n\"This ban is illegal, will put people's lives in danger and raises the alarm about President Trump's disregard for separation of powers,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrant Rights Project and the lead attorney in the case.\n\n\"There is no justifiable reason to flatly deny people the right to apply for asylum, and we cannot send them back to danger based on the manner of their entry,\" he said.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security argued that the President has the right to suspend entry by individuals into the United States if he determines it to be in the national interest.\n\n\"As the Supreme Court affirmed this summer, Congress has given the President broad authority to limit or even stop the entry of aliens into this country. Further, asylum is a discretionary benefit given by the Executive Branch only when legal conditions are met and a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted,\" Waldman and Stafford said in the joint statement from the departments. \"It is lawful and appropriate that this discretionary benefit not be given to those who violate a lawful and tailored presidential proclamation aimed at controlling immigration in the national interest.\n\nFollowing the ruling, some top Democrats called on the Trump administration to work with Congress on immigration reforms.\n\n\"Once again, the courts have been forced to step in and preserve the rule of law. No one, including the President, can rewrite the nation's immigration laws on their own,\" Reps. Jerrod Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, said in a joint statement.\n\nEarlier this month, the President issued a proclamation referring to \"large, organized groups\" who were traveling through Mexico and \"reportedly intend to enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and to seek asylum.\"\n\nIt said that those seeking entry can only do so temporarily at recognized ports of entry to allow for \"orderly processing\" and denied entry to those at any other location along the southern border.\n\n\"But aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the southern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum,\" the President wrote.\n\n\"The arrival of large numbers of aliens will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States,\" the proclamation read."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Democratic, GOP lawmakers to scrutinize Ivanka Trump's use of private emails", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nY8GjI42Zfg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump's use of a private email account will soon face new scrutiny on Capitol Hill, with a key House committee and Senate GOP chairman planning to look into whether President Donald Trump's daughter and senior adviser violated the law when conducting government business.\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee plans to revive efforts in the new Congress to look into the White House's use of private emails amid reports that Ivanka Trump used her personal account through much of 2017 to trade messages with Cabinet officials, White House aides and other government employees.\n\nThe likely incoming Democratic chairman of the committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, plans to renew efforts to look into private emails next year after the Republican-controlled panel dropped its investigation into the matter when a separate controversy arose last year, according to a Cummings aide.\n\n\"We plan to continue our Federal Records Act and Presidential Records Act investigation,\" the aide said Tuesday. \"We want to know if she complied with the law.\"\n\nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson told CNN Tuesday that he is \"concerned\" about Ivanka Trump's use of private emails -- and plans to look into the situation.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: Team Ivanka's email explanation is beyond ridiculous", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/I2Ea_HR_dbU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Faced with a Washington Post report that Ivanka Trump had regularly used a private email account to conduct government business in 2017, the explanation from her side went like this: She didn't know that was wrong!\n\nI'm not kidding.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\"Some aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump's personal emails \u2014 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.\"\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump lawyer Abbe Lowell, said something similar in a statement following the Post story. (Again, bolding is mine.)\n\n\"While transitioning into government, until the White House provided her the same guidance they had to others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\" Mirijanian said.\n\nHow. Is. That. Possible.\n\nHow could Ivanka Trump have not known -- even prior to the White House providing her \"guidance\" -- that using a private email account to conduct official business was a giant no-no?\n\nAs you may remember, the central attack by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign centered on her decision to use a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. Trump insisted that Clinton was not being fully transparent about why she used a private email server for government business -- and used that as a foothold into a broader questioning of whether the former secretary of state could be trusted with the nation's top job.\n\n\"How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk,\" Trump tweeted in June 2016. A month later, he tweeted this : \"The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!\"\n\nThen there was the drama regarding the FBI's investigation into Clinton's emails -- and whether she had broken any laws regarding the transmission of classified information by using a private account. Months after announcing the FBI would not press charges against Clinton, then-FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress indicating the investigation had been re-opened due to emails found on a laptop owned by former New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has blamed the Comey email announcement for her loss. \"There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\" Clinton told donors shortly after her defeat . \"Our analysis is that Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\"\n\nWhether you buy that explanation from Clinton is actually beside the point. The point is this: It is literally impossible to believe, after everything that transpired during the 2016 campaign regarding Clinton's use of a private email to conduct government business, that Ivanka Trump was simply unaware that what she was doing wasn't allowed. It's just not possible.\n\nTeam Ivanka was quick to note that the two situations weren't -- and aren't -- exactly the same. Again, Mirijanian:\n\n\"To address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump's personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"\n\nWhich, OK. Clinton did delete a large chunk of the emails she sent from her private account after someone working for her did a broad canvas of all the emails she had sent and determined that they were entirely personal and therefore could be deleted without sharing them with investigators. (Roughly 50% of the emails on Clinton's private server were deleted, while 44% were turned over to investigators.)\n\nAnd sure, there are -- at least on the surface -- some specific differences between what Clinton did and what Ivanka did. But man, in the big picture it's pretty damn similar.\n\nThe Mirijanian statement misses the point. It's stretched credulity well beyond snapping to think that Ivanka was simply blissfully unaware that what she was doing in using her private email account was totally on the up and up. No sentient being -- and certainly not one working at the top levels of government who also happens to be the eldest daughter of the President of the United States -- could have lived through the 2016 campaign and not understood this basic equation: Private emails for government business = bad.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether what Ivanka Trump did merits an official investigation -- although I strongly suspect the Democratic House will be taking a hard look come January. But what is quite clear in all of this is that Ivanka absolutely had to have known better."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "North Carolina chickenpox outbreak blamed on vaccination exemptions", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/xVVNLZXRAYA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A chickenpox outbreak among students at Asheville Waldorf School in North Carolina has grown to 36 cases as of Monday, and exemptions from vaccination were a contributing factor, according to the Buncombe County Health Department, which has been monitoring the situation since the end of October.\n\nThe school is closed for Thanksgiving break and could not be reached for comment.\n\nThough North Carolina requires vaccination for all children attending schools, the state permits both medical and religious exemptions. Still, vaccination rates in the state outperformed national figures in 2013 and 2014, according to publicly available information.\n\nDr. Jennifer Mullendore, the Buncombe County medical director, said that last year, the Asheville Waldorf kindergarten class had the highest percentage of religious exemptions in the county and among the highest in the state. The state as a whole sees about 1.2% religious exemptions among children enrolled in kindergarten, she said.\n\nMullendore said the figures from last year are the latest because data has not been gathered and analyzed for the current school year.\n\nIsolation and quarantine\n\nTo monitor the situation at Asheville Waldorf, the health department has requested that the school continue to send it information about any new cases, she said. Meanwhile, the school is requiring anyone who has the disease to stay home, while classmates of someone contagious (though not yet sick) must remain at home for 21 days.\n\n\"The reason for that is it can take 21 days for the time somebody is exposed to chickenpox for them to actually develop the signs and symptoms of chickenpox,\" Mullendore said. \"We don't want to have to keep those kids at home. If the child gets one dose of the chickenpox vaccine, they can return to school immediately.\"\n\nChildren whose parents provide evidence of immunity, such as blood work or a doctor's statement, can also return to school, she said.\n\nThis 21-day quarantine is \"our last resort in terms of containing and stopping the spread of the illness so that we don't see more cases and so nobody ends up with a complication,\" Mullendore said. No complications and no hospitalizations have been reported, she added.\n\n\"We can't predict who is going to end up with complications,\" she said. \"There are case reports of previously healthy children ending up in hospital because of chickenpox -- or dying because of chickenpox.\"\n\nMost parents do not hesitate to vaccinate\n\n\"The vaccine for chickenpox and all vaccines out there are safe and effective,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPew survey that found Most Americans agree that vaccines are safe for healthy children.\n\nAnother Pew Research Center survey in 2017 showed that a solid majority of Americans, 88%, believe that the benefits of vaccinating their children against measles, mumps and rubella outweigh the risks. By contrast, 10% believe that the risks of the MMR vaccine, specifically, outweigh the benefits.\n\nWhile the majority of all major religious groups say the MMR vaccine should be required for healthy schoolchildren, white evangelical Protestants tend to express less support for requiring the MMR vaccine. People who have no religious affiliation similarly express less support for the vaccine, according to Pew.\n\nRecently, an outbreak of measles was reported in New York among the orthodox Jewish community, with origins in Israel.\n\nMullendore said that what's happening at Asheville Waldorf \"demonstrates what happens when we have a population that is not immunized, that has not gotten the vaccine.

You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said.

Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\nThe study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.\n\nNot a cure\n\nDr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that \"it's not a cure.\"\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\nStill, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 554 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 496 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is \"treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,\" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nTwo-thirds of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nErica Gibson, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, and Ellis Glover.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\nDr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is \"the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.\"\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Congo health workers face violence as Ebola virus spreads", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/CSxw58AcBxw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The death toll from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to rise as violence hampers health workers' efforts to battle the virus.\n\nThere are now 358 cases of Ebola and 213 deaths since the outbreak began in August, according to the nation's Ministry of Health.\n\nConflict between militant groups and government forces has made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest-hit areas.\n\nOperations suspended\n\nOn Friday evening, an armed group tried to attack UN peacekeepers in the city of Beni in North Kivu province -- the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nThe attack occurred near the Ebola Response Emergency Operations Center and hotels where many Ebola health workers are staying, according to the health ministry\n\nThe peacekeepers were able to push the attackers back after several hours of clashes but all field activities were suspended in Beni Saturday due to the violence.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway, organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCrashes can, of course, occur at very high speeds, but injuries are typically not serious, usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line, when the bike \"exploded,\" Krause said, but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.\n\nAs Mario Andretti, one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions, put it: \"If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46212058", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Ridofranz/Getty Images\n\nNearly one in five local hospital services are consistently failing to hit any of their key waiting-time targets, BBC analysis shows.\n\nTwenty-nine hospital trusts and boards out of 157 have not hit a single target for a whole year.\n\nNorthern Ireland is struggling the most - all five trusts have failed their key targets for A&E, cancer and routine operations every time in 2017-18.\n\nNHS leaders said the NHS was facing a very difficult winter.\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to display this content.

It means their wait for tests and scans is not counted in the 13-week wait target.\n\nIs this as bad as it has ever been?\n\nAnother way of looking at performance is to judge it on a nation-level rather than by local hospital service.\n\nIf you do that performance has sunk to its worst level in recent times.\n\nEngland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have failed to hit any of the three targets for more than a year.\n\nIt is the first time this has happened across the UK since targets started to be introduced more than a decade ago.\n\nThe last time any target was met on a national level was in August 2017 in Scotland.\n\nIn Wales, none of its three key targets has been hit for at least five years.\n\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents managers, said it was clear the system was facing \"significant strain\".\n\nWhich hospitals are struggling the most?\n\nIn England, 16 hospital trusts out of 131 missed all their monthly targets.

He said the EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain.\n\nGibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a \"well-known tactic\" of raising issues at the last minute.

Those talks have led to a \"protocol\" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control.\n\nThere seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had \"no significant concerns over Gibraltar\", that the \"behaviour of the British government was good\" and an agreement could be reached.\n\nSo what has changed?\n\nThe Spanish government says that its \"bone of contention\" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators.\n\nA senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: \"This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain.\"\n\nUnderlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a \"British colony\" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid.\n\nThough Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it.\n\nA referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote.\n\nSpain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU.\n\nGibraltar in numbers\n\nGibraltar has a population of 33,600 and 7.7 million visitors a year\n\nFinancial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there\n\nIt has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates\n\nAlthough there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25%\n\nGibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita than either the UK or Spain.\n\nGibraltar profile"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Backlash over May's EU nationals 'queue jumping' vow", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46274118", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:00:45", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: EU nationals won't be able to 'jump the queue' after Brexit\n\nTheresa May is facing a backlash after she said EU workers would no longer be able to \"jump the queue\" after Brexit.\n\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's words were \"disgraceful\" and EU citizens living in the UK said they would fuel hate crimes against them.\n\nThe comments came in a speech to business leaders on Monday, in which she vowed to end EU free movement after Brexit.\n\nDowning Street said EU citizens made an \"important contribution\" to the UK.\n\nThe government says it wants the estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU nations already living in the UK to stay after Brexit but they will have to apply for leave to remain.\n\nBut Mrs May used her speech to the CBI to highlight the fact that the proposed EU withdrawal agreement will bring an \"end to free movement, once and for all\".\n\nThe government has yet to set out details of what this will mean in practice in the longer term, but Mrs May has said at some point in the future, after the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU kicks in, that EU citizens will be treated the same as those arriving from outside the EU.\n\n\"It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi,\" said Mrs May in her speech.\n\n\"Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer.\"\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the prime minister's language was \"offensive\" and \"disgraceful\".\n\n\"That the case for Brexit has been reduced to such a miserable and self-defeating bottom line is depressing in the extreme.

In a straw-poll taken at the end of the most recent site-selection workshop, it came out the clear favourite. Nasa's administration has now endorsed the choice.\n\nJezero is sited just north of Mars' equator. It is named after a town in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In some Slavic languages the word \"jezero\" also means \"lake\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Mars 2020 rover is based on the design of the Curiosity robot\n\nHow does 2020 link to future missions?\n\nAnother of the robot's key objectives will be to select and \"cache\" in small canisters some rock samples that could, at a later date, be collected and returned to Earth labs for analysis.\n\nNasa is working with the European Space Agency (Esa) on this initiative, but exactly when the sample tubes might come home is uncertain.\n\nPlanning with Esa was at an early stage, said Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's science chief. \"Depending on how the details come out, it could be in the early 2030s,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The 2020 mission will again use a \"Skycrane\" to put the rover on the surface\n\nIs the 2020 rover a copy of Curiosity?\n\nThe 2020 rover is based on the one-tonne Curiosity robot that the agency landed in Gale Crater in 2012. Curiosity has been a great success, and Nasa wants to repeat it. Using the same \"template\" also saves money; some equipment spares were left over from 2012.\n\nThat said, instrument-wise, the new vehicle is quite a bit different. Yes, it will again feature cameras, a robotic arm, a drill and a laser - but there is a new suite of sensors and analysis tools, and there is even an experiment to demonstrate how future astronauts might make oxygen on the Red Planet.\n\nThe new robot will use the same \"Skycrane\" technology that put Curiosity down with such great precision six years ago - but with an add-on. Engineers have developed an on-the-fly mapping system called Terrain-Relative Navigation which ought to bring even greater accuracy to the landing process.\n\nWhat else can we look forward to on Mars?\n\nMissions to Mars can only launch inside a tight time window due to the alignment of the planets.\n\nThe 2020 venture will leave Earth in the July/August of that year and should land on 18 February 2021.\n\n\"Nasa has a long and successful track record at Mars. Since Mariner 4 flew by Mars in 1965, we've orbited, we've landed and we've roved across the surface of the Red Planet,\" said Lori Glaze, the acting director of Nasa's planetary science division. \"And we've got another opportunity to improve our track record a week from today when we land InSight on the surface. We're all looking forward to that.\"\n\nUnlike 2020 and Curiosity, Insight is a static lander. It will be the first mission dedicated to \"looking inside\" the planet. It will use seismometers to listen for \"Marsquakes\", to help build a picture of Mars' internal structure.\n\nEsa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 also. European scientists recently selected Oxia Planum as its destination. Satellite imagery suggests, as with Jezero and Gale, this ancient terrain came into prolonged contact with water.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "The physicist called Einstein - but not the one you think", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-46261009", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Video\n\nBBC 100 Women is celebrating talented women from history whose work has been overshadowed by their male relatives.

They stand accused of committing egregious human rights and participating in organised corruption.\n\nThis is the biggest campaign of mass arrests targeting powerful figures from the security and military establishment since the reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power seven months ago.\n\nDays after the top leadership of two of the most powerful institutions in the country were charged, Ahmed's cabinet approved draft legislation on the establishment of a National Peace and Reconciliation Commission with the objective of healing the deep social wounds left by years of repression under previous Ethiopian governments. While Ethiopia certainly needs both accountability and reconciliation to come to terms with its violent and divisive past, it is not clear how the government aims to reconcile the two processes.\n\nWhile legal accountability and reconciliation are not incompatible, they are nevertheless separate processes, with their own unique procedures and different goals. Prosecution emphasises punishment and vengeance, while reconciliation underscores healing.\n\nProsecution is governed by the strict rules of criminal procedure and focuses on an uncovering the truth about a particular crime and delivering individualised justice. Reconciliation, on the other hand, is not governed by strict legalistic procedures and its primary aim is to help the entire nation confront the past by producing as complete a picture of what happened as possible.\n\nPursuing prosecutorial justice while at the same time promoting reconciliation of a highly divided society, particularly in a highly fragile setting in which decades of state-sponsored acts of terror and violence resulted in the gradual rupture of the social fabric, requires a strategic and holistic integration of the processes, as well as careful planning.\n\nDetestable crimes\n\nAnnouncing the charges against the accused, Attorney General Berhanu Tsegaye revealed gruesome details of heinous crimes committed by security forces. Tsegaye accused the top leadership of the Ethiopian intelligence of torturing political detainees suspected of holding critical views of the government, using cruel methods such as waterboarding, gang rape, electric shocks, hanging suspects on a tree and beating them, and tying suspects naked to a tree overnight.\n\nThe attorney general also accused METEC, the largest military-industrial conglomerate in the country tasked with building major projects, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), of perpetrating an outrageous plunder of the national wealth.\n\nA recent documentary produced by Oromia Broadcasting Network (OBN) and broadcasted by several state TV channels shows how ships, cranes and aeroplanes were purchased without any formal bids for the private gain of certain individuals. The corporation, which was established as part of Ethiopia's ambitious Growth and Transformation Plan, is blighted by incompetence, nepotism, militarised patronage, and impunity - it is nothing but a grand embezzlement scheme.\n\nWhile the routine use of torture and the plunder of national wealth by a criminal underworld comprised of members of the national intelligence, financial institutions, and other key state sectors had already been well documented by human rights organisations in the past, the latest revelations provided more substance to these allegations.\n\nAs a country undergoing a complex period of transition, Ethiopia should hold to account those who perpetrated these detestable crimes which have torn apart the nation.\n\nUnder these conditions, the legal prosecution can be an integral part of a multipronged institutional response to state-sponsored acts of violence and organised plunder. It can contribute to the creation of a culture of accountability and strengthen the rule of law.\n\nReconciliation or justice?\n\nHowever, the legal prosecution of these criminals would not heal the deep wounds and repair the social fabric ripped apart by decades of violence and antagonism. In her seminal book titled, Between Vengeance and Forgiveness: Facing History after Genocide and Mass Violence, Martha Minow writes, \"when the societal goals include restoring dignity to victims, offering a basis for individual healing, and promoting reconciliation across a divided nation, a truth commission again may be as or more powerful than prosecutions.\"\n\nFor those subjected to torture and other forms of rights abuses, a trial is unlikely to heal their wounds or restore their trust in public authority. As Holocaust survivor Jean Amery wrote in his famous essay, Torture, \"whoever was tortured, stays tortured. Torture is ineradicably burned into him, even when no clinically objective traces can be detected.\" The adversarial nature of the criminal trial, the minimal role of victims in the proceedings, and the specific nature of truth and justice pursued in criminal justice makes trials a rather limited instrument for healing and reconciliation.\n\nDecades of state-sponsored violence left behind an institutional culture of impunity and a collective trauma that will continue to haunt the Ethiopian body-politic. Coming to terms with this painful past requires both accountability and a peace and reconciliation process that allows for a comprehensive official investigation and a public acknowledgement of the abuses and harms done.\n\nAn online survey of more than 2,700 individuals revealed that 77 percent of those surveyed are not prepared to forgive individuals accused of torture and other grave atrocities, even if the accused are willing to tell the whole truth and acknowledge their wrongdoings fully and unreservedly.\n\nWhile the urge for retribution is understandable, the way the government reconciles the apparent tension between these two processes can go a long way in channelling the desire for vengeance towards a commitment to forgiveness and peaceful coexistence.\n\nMaking a clean break with the past and charting a new path towards democracy is no easy feat. But if these processes are to serve as a bridge to help Ethiopia transition from a painful and divisive past to a democratic future committed to human rights and human dignity, the government should consider at least the following.\n\nFirst, the law creating the Peace and Reconciliation Commission must establish a threshold test for the type of cases that will be prosecuted. This is critical not only to guarantee the credibility, legitimacy and integrity of the process but also to minimise the likelihood of politicisation of both processes. Second, the law must place victims at the centre of the process, allowing them a proper place and voice to share their experiences and articulate a coherent and comprehensive narrative of what happened. Third, the government must grant and guarantee a fair trial for all those it prosecutes.\n\nThe way the government reconciles the apparent tension between these two processes can go a long way in channelling the desire for vengeance towards a commitment to forgiveness and peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

It will be the first American spacecraft to land since the Curiosity rover in 2012 and the first dedicated to exploring underground.\n\nNASA is going with a tried-and-true method to get this mechanical miner to the surface of the red planet. Engine firings will slow its final descent and the spacecraft will plop down on its rigid legs, mimicking the landings of earlier successful missions.\n\nThat's where old school ends on this $1 billion U.S.-European effort.\n\nOnce flight controllers in California determine the coast is clear at the landing site \u2014 fairly flat and rock free \u2014 InSight's 6-foot (1.8-meter) arm will remove the two main science experiments from the lander's deck and place them directly on the Martian surface.\n\nNo spacecraft has attempted anything like that before.\n\nThe firsts don't stop there.\n\nOne experiment will attempt to penetrate 16 feet (5 meters) into Mars, using a self-hammering nail with heat sensors to gauge the planet's internal temperature. That would shatter the out-of-this-world depth record of 8 feet (2 { meters) drilled by the Apollo moonwalkers nearly a half-century ago for lunar heat measurements.\n\nThe astronauts also left behind instruments to measure moonquakes. InSight carries the first seismometers to monitor for marsquakes \u2014 if they exist. Yet another experiment will calculate Mars' wobble, providing clues about the planet's core.\n\nIt won't be looking for signs of life, past or present. No life detectors are on board.\n\nThe spacecraft is like a self-sufficient robot, said lead scientist Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n\"It's got its own brain. It's got an arm that can manipulate things around. It can listen with its seismometer. It can feel things with the pressure sensors and the temperature sensors. It pulls its own power out of the sun,\" he said.\n\nBy scoping out the insides of Mars, scientists could learn how our neighbor \u2014 and other rocky worlds, including the Earth and moon \u2014 formed and transformed over billions of years. Mars is much less geologically active than Earth, and so its interior is closer to being in its original state \u2014 a tantalizing time capsule.\n\nInSight stands to \"revolutionize the way we think about the inside of the planet,\" said NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen.\n\nBut first, the 800-pound (360-kilogram) vehicle needs to get safely to the Martian surface. This time, there won't be a ball bouncing down with the spacecraft tucked inside, like there were for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004. And there won't be a sky crane to lower the lander like there was for the six-wheeled Curiosity during its dramatic \"seven minutes of terror.\"\n\n\"That was crazy,\" acknowledged InSight's project manager, Tom Hoffman. But he noted, \"Any time you're trying to land on Mars, it's crazy, frankly. I don't think there's a sane way to do it.\"\n\nNo matter how it's done, getting to Mars and landing there is hard \u2014 and unforgiving.\n\nEarth's success rate at Mars is a mere 40 percent. That includes planetary flybys dating back to the early 1960s, as well as orbiters and landers.\n\nWhile it's had its share of flops, the U.S. has by far the best track record. No one else has managed to land and operate a spacecraft on Mars. Two years ago, a European lander came in so fast, its descent system askew, that it carved out a crater on impact.\n\nThis time, NASA is borrowing a page from the 1976 twin Vikings and the 2008 Phoenix, which also were stationary and three-legged.\n\n\"But you never know what Mars is going to do,\" Hoffman said. \"Just because we've done it before doesn't mean we're not nervous and excited about doing it again.\"\n\nWind gusts could send the spacecraft into a dangerous tumble during descent, or the parachute could get tangled. A dust storm like the one that enveloped Mars this past summer could hamper InSight's ability to generate solar power. A leg could buckle. The arm could jam.\n\nThe tensest time for flight controllers in Pasadena, California: the six minutes from the time the spacecraft hits Mars' atmosphere and touchdown. They'll have jars of peanuts on hand \u2014 a good-luck tradition dating back to 1964's successful Ranger 7 moon mission.\n\nInSight will enter Mars' atmosphere at a supersonic 12,300 mph (19,800 kph), relying on its white nylon parachute and a series of engine firings to slow down enough for a soft upright landing on Mars' Elysium Planitia, a sizable equatorial plain.\n\nHoffman hopes it's \"like a Walmart parking lot in Kansas.\"\n\nThe flatter the better so the lander doesn't tip over, ending the mission, and so the robotic arm can set the science instruments down.\n\nInSight \u2014 short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport \u2014 will rest close to the ground, its top deck barely a yard, or meter, above the surface. Once its twin circular solar panels open, the lander will occupy the space of a large car.\n\nIf NASA gets lucky, a pair of briefcase-size satellites trailing InSight since their joint May liftoff could provide near-live updates during the lander's descent. There's an eight-minute lag in communications between Earth and Mars.\n\nThe experimental CubeSats, dubbed WALL-E and EVE from the 2008 animated movie, will zoom past Mars and remain in perpetual orbit around the sun, their technology demonstration complete.\n\nIf WALL-E and EVE are mute, landing news will come from NASA orbiters at Mars, just not as quickly.\n\nThe first pictures of the landing site should start flowing shortly after touchdown. It will be at least 10 weeks before the science instruments are deployed. Add another several weeks for the heat probe to bury into Mars.\n\nThe mission is designed to last one full Martian year, the equivalent of two Earth years.\n\nWith landing day so close to Thanksgiving, many of the flight controllers will be eating turkey at their desks on the holiday.\n\nHoffman expects his team will wait until Monday to give full and proper thanks."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Healthy Children Who Aren't Growing, May Not Make Enough Human Growth Hormone", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/health-growth-hormone/4666013.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Most healthy children between the ages of four and 10 grow about five centimeters (two inches) a year.

Mora lays out a future scenario in which in 2100 New York will be constantly dealing with the potentially devastating effects of four different climate hazards, including extreme weather and sea level rise.\n\nAll of these effects are measurable and in the future a city like Miami might be dealing with drought, extreme heat, sea level rise and more numerous and more powerful hurricanes. \"Any coastal area in the tropics is going to be on fire\" Mora says. Sydney, Los Angeles, Brazil and Mexico City are all at risk as the effects of climate change stack up.\"\n\nMora's study is impressive in its detail, noting, \"Planes can\u2019t fly during heat waves ... wires short circuit during heat waves,\" Mora says. And for people who work outdoors it can literally get too hot and \"their livelihoods depend on their job ability to work out doors.\"\n\nAll of these impacts add up and have a profound economic effect. Mora says they create stressed communities that have less economic ability to deal with change, plus higher financial costs thanks to the infrastructure damage and repair associated with predicted extreme weather events.\n\nIs it too late?\n\nBut despite all of the bad news in this assessment, Mora is bullish on our ability to head off the effects of climate change.\n\n\"This is not game over,\" he says. \"We are not too late to turn this around and we have pathways to reduce emissions what we need to do is implement them.\"\n\nMora says the solution to the world's carbon problem will not come from the world's leaders, despite agreements like the Paris Accord for which hundreds of the world's leaders came together to commit to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHe says the real change to mitigate climate change through gradual cutting of emissions will come from the public, and he points to efforts like Hawaii's decision to become a carbon neutral state by 2045 and to shift to 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nMora is also involved with tree planting efforts in Hawaii that he says if done worldwide could help the planet actually remove carbon from the atmosphere, not just stop putting it in.

Pyongyang\u2019s cyber operatives, like the Lazarus Group, have been linked to computer system infiltrations like the 2014 Sony Pictures Studios hack prior to the release of the U.S. film \u201cThe Interview\u201d and the attempted theft of close to $1 billion from the central Bangladesh bank using the SWIFT banking network in 2016.\n\nBut how did Pyongyang become so adept at hacking while not possessing rich resources and being under tough International sanctions?\n\nSeungjoo Kim, a professor at Korea University\u2019s Graduate School of Information Security says the answer, in part, is because North Korea\u2019s computer hackers operate in China and Europe with easy access to the internet.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea practices their craft under real conditions, like hacking cryptocurrency sites or stealing information,\u201d he said, \u201cThese repeated exercises help to improve their skills.\u201d\n\nAs an instructor, Seungjoo Kim teaches his students how hackers invade other systems using traditional textbooks instruction. But without real-world trials, he says they can\u2019t obtain the knowledge needed to test systems or prevent hostile attacks.\n\n\u201cBasically, you should teach basic computer knowledge, and then try to solve some hacking problems,\u201d he said, adding that the best way to improve one\u2019s computer infiltration skills is with real-time and real-world practice.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea acquires [their] knowledge by invading other systems,\u201d said Kim.\n\nHe added that because North Korea can directly attack other countries, that effort has enabled Pyongyang to quickly develop their world-renowned hacking skills.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s cyber army\n\nExperts assert there are between 6,000 and 7,500 members of North Korea\u2019s cyber army, split into a number of divisions to carry out cyberterrorism against state infrastructure, financial institutions, and the latest hijacking of defense technology.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea was inspired by the Chinese cyberwar units and learned from them,\u201d said NK Intellectuals Solidarity director Heung Kwan Kim, \u201cRecognizing their power, North Korea set up the first unit within the central government in 1993.\u201d\n\nWhile Pyongyang\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau is comprised of six divisions and overseas operations in South Korea, the United States, and Japan, it\u2019s another bureau that is responsible for the bulk of North Korea\u2019s cyber warfare.\n\n\u201cUnit 121 oversees Unit 180, Unit 91, and lab 110,\u201d Heung Kwan Kim told VOA.\n\nA 500-person strong Unit 121 was created in 1998, and in 2009 the group successfully carried out 77 attacks by overwhelming computer networks through unleashing an onslaught of Internet traffic.\n\nThis led Pyongyang to conclude that cyber-warfare was \u201cthe most suitable form of war\u201d for North Korea in the modern era, according to Heung Kwan Kim.\n\nAttacks continued throughout 2014, and in 2015. When North Korea reorganized their divisions, Unit 121 was given the mission of attacking a foreign nation\u2019s infrastructure, such as transportation networks, telecommunications, gas, electric power, nuclear power, and aviation systems.\n\nUnit 91\u2019s focus was shifted to acquiring \u201cadvanced technologies needed for nuclear development and long-range missiles from developed countries.\u201d\n\nFinally, the role of Unit 180 was changed for it to target financial systems and to focus on block chain technology.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchains\n\nWith international sanctions crippling Pyongyang\u2019s coffers, Heung Kwan Kim said North Korea shifted their cyberattacks to private systems, rather than government networks, because the smaller entities weren\u2019t as well protected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem of North Korea\u2019s high ability and low security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe numerous attacks on small and private companies have led to allegations that Pyongyang is hacking into cryptocurrency exchanges to steal virtual money, like Bitcoin, said Seungjoo Kim. Stolen cryptocurrencies are attractive because they are difficult to trace back to their original owner.\n\nIn 2017, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus was accused of attacking South Korea cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. The cyber thieves made off with nearly $7 million in digital currencies.\n\nThe hackers also obtained personal information of users stored on the compromised servers. The BBC reports North Korea was later able to ransom additional funds from the owners in exchange for deleting the data.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is easy to steal because it moves in cyberspace,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo earn cryptocurrency in a legitimate way, cutting-edge computers are required, but North Korea doesn\u2019t have them, so they attack computers abroad and hack mining programs.\u201d\n\nThe hacked computers then send any virtual coins it uncovers to North Korean digital wallets they can convert to hard currency.\n\nTo curtail North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks, he advocates a detente in the virtual world that\u2019s similar to the easing of tensions taking place on the peninsula. However, that may be difficult, as it would require Pyongyang to admit it committed acts of cyberwarfare.\n\nIn addition, it would require \u201cRussia and China not only participating in current real-world sanctions, cyber sanctions at the same time,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nThe last component, he said, would be for governments to codify what measures would be employed as proportional responses, should additional cyberattacks take place and prepare for those events."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Where Did North Korea\u2019s Cyber Army Come From?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-cyber-army/4666395.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "North Korean hackers continue to circumvent protections to compromise computer systems around the globe.

They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some members of the Saudi royal family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king\u2019s death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nPrince Ahmed, King Salman\u2019s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.\n\nPrince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family\u2019s senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom\u2019s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA\u2019s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cvery premature\u201d but \u201cpossible,\u201d and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \u201cnothing else to add at this time\u201d.\n\nThe Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry \u201cfocus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\u201d and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. ROLE KEY\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi\u2019s security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \u201cwould not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\u201d because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\u201cThey (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \u201croll some heads to appease the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role \u2013 including one of MbS\u2019s closest aides.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi King Salman expressed support for his son, the crown prince, who is accused or orchestrating the slaying.\n\nALLEGIANCE COUNCIL\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman\u2019s wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi\u2019s killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away.

Getting An Accurate Count Is No Easy Task.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-wildfire-missing-persons-camp-fire_us_5bf43467e4b01909c809d726", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "This past Friday, more than a week after the Camp wildfire erupted in Northern California\u2019s Butte County and reduced the town of Paradise to ash, officials released gut-wrenching new figures: In addition to at least 71 fatalities, the number of people still unaccounted for in that area had soared to more than 1,000 \u2015 up from 631 one day earlier.\n\nBy Saturday, those numbers had climbed yet again, to 76 deaths and nearly 1,300 missing persons.\n\nMany feared that surge in the number of unaccounted-for people meant the final death toll from the blaze, already the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history, would grow significantly. But Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has stressed that the list is raw data and does not necessarily paint an accurate picture of who is missing.\n\nTo describe the task of getting a precise count as \u201cdifficult\u201d would be a wild understatement, Honea told HuffPost.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Cal Fire and police teams transfer the remains of a fire victim, who was found in a Paradise, California, residence, into a hearse on Nov. 16, 2018.\n\n\u201cIt would seem that it would be very simple \u2015 just call in and give us the names,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cBut given how chaotic this situation has been, the magnitude of the situation, the number of people that we\u2019ve had to evacuate \u2014 it\u2019s nowhere near as simple a task as one might think it is at first blush.\u201d\n\nThe weekend\u2019s dramatic increase in the still-missing count came after officials went back through the massive volume of emails and 911 calls that poured in during and after the inferno swept through Paradise and the surrounding area. In the early stages of the fire, overwhelmed dispatchers simply took down the caller\u2019s name, the caller\u2019s contact information and whom a caller was looking for. The sheriff\u2019s office has since ramped up its resources and combed through those communications, compiling a master list of every person flagged as unaccounted for.\n\nThe list is constantly changing. It has included duplicate names and even people who died years earlier. Those who called to report someone as missing don\u2019t always call back when they\u2019ve located that individual. In \u201cmany, many cases,\u201d Honea said, people on the list have turned out to be safe, completely unaware that someone was worried about them.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, owes to the fact that the normal course of how people stay connected with their circle of friends and family has been disrupted,\u201d Honea said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been evacuated. Their text messaging, cell phones, landline phones, email, all of that has been disrupted.\u201d\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost A member of the Tuolumne Sheriff Search & Rescue team searches for human remains at a home in Paradise.\n\nThe character of the community in Paradise and surrounding towns like Magalia and Pulga has made this search particularly challenging. Many residents chose to settle down in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas for the isolation. Some of them are notoriously private; many wanted to live off the grid. They include a lot of lower-income retirees. As a result, a significant number of residents lack cell phones, as well as family and friends in the area whom they might get in touch with after they\u2019ve evacuated.\n\nHonea reasoned that it would be best to put every possible name on a list, push it out to the public and work through it by asking the community for help locating people. The alternative would have been to tackle it internally.\n\n\u201cMy thought process was progress over perfection,\u201d Honea said. \u201cThe list will fluctuate up and down. As we get more data pushed into it, you\u2019ll get more information.\u201d\n\nSome 5,000 firefighters continue to battle the Camp fire, which as of Tuesday morning was 70 percent contained. Since Saturday, Butte County officials have also managed to confirm the whereabouts of hundreds of people who were previously unaccounted for. As of Sunday evening, just shy of 1,000 people were on the list, down nearly 300 from one day earlier. And by Monday evening, the count of the missing stood at 699.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll feel good again,\u201d Honea said Monday evening. \u201cBut I\u2019m encouraged by the drop. \u2026 I\u2019m optimistic about the process that we have going and I feel like we are getting our arms around it.\u201d\n\nMembers of the sheriff\u2019s search and rescue team, as well as volunteers, continue going from property to property, using tools and cadaver-sniffing dogs to search for human remains. The death toll from the Camp fire rose to 79 on Monday, after officials discovered the remains of two more people.\n\nThe fire has scorched more than 150,000 acres and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including 12,637 residences.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Eris, a member of the Butte County Sheriff's Search & Rescue K9 unit, walks with handlers through a devastated home in Paradise, searching for remains.\n\nThe Camp fire is by far the most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history, topping the 2017 Tubbs fire, which torched some 5,600 structures and killed 22 people. Fourteen of the state\u2019s 20 most-destructive fires on record have occurred since 2003.\n\nAdditionally, 15 of the state\u2019s 20 largest fires on record have occurred since 2002. The Mendocino Complex fire, which burned more than 450,000 acres north of Santa Rosa in July, surpassed last year\u2019s Thomas fire as the largest wildfire in California\u2019s history.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have both traveled to California to see the destruction from the Camp fire. Trump has blamed the state\u2019s wildfires on everything from a lack of raking to a nonexistent shortage of water to fight fires to \u201cbad environmental laws.\u201d\n\nDuring his visit last week, Zinke said, \u201cThis is not the time for finger pointing.\u201d He repeated that line in a Sunday interview with Breitbart News, only to turn around and blame \u201cradical environmentalists,\u201d as he often does, for the disaster.\n\n\u201cI will lay this on the foot of those environmental radicals that have prevented us from managing the forests for years,\u201d said Zinke. \u201cAnd you know what? This is on them.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration continues to ignore the scientific research showing that climate change is contributing to extreme fires out West and that the effect is expected to worsen as climate change drives up global temperatures and fuels droughts."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "As States Push For Digital Drivers Licenses, Critics Cite Privacy Concerns", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/could-plastic-drivers-licenses-become-a-thing-of-the_us_5bf41780e4b09851702fe10e", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "States say digital licenses are convenient and safe. But critics say they might be a bad idea for civil rights.\n\nGodofredo A. Vasquez/Houston Chronicle via The Associated Press Nicole Johnson, right, asks a customer to take off his hat for a photograph at a Texas Department of Public Safety driver\u2019s license office in Houston last year. Officials in more than a dozen states are considering offering residents digital driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nBy Jenni Bergal\n\nMillions of people may be able to show their smartphones rather than a plastic card to prove they\u2019re legit to drive, vote or buy a beer in coming years.\n\nLouisiana in July became the first state to make digital licenses available to anyone who wants them, and at least 14 other states either have developed a program, run a pilot or are studying the possibility, according to the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of American adults already own a smartphone, including 94 percent of adults under 30, and many state motor vehicle officials think residents will appreciate the convenience of having their driver\u2019s license available in an app.\n\nOfficials also like that the licenses are connected to a central database and can be updated easily with, for example, suspensions or revocations.\n\nAnd unlike plastic cards that can easily be counterfeited or tampered with, mobile licenses are less susceptible to fraud, they say.\n\nBut as is often the case when something analog goes digital, privacy advocates worry about the potential for government overreach and fear the digital licenses and motor vehicle databases will become vulnerable to hackers.\n\n\u201cThese are shiny new things, and states are only talking about the upsides,\u201d said Chad Marlow, a senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New York. \u201cIt is very important the public understand there are significant risks with digital driver\u2019s licenses. I think it is irresponsible for states to offer them [without explaining those risks].\n\nNew Technology\n\nColorado, Delaware, Maryland and Wyoming are among the states that have started a digital driver\u2019s license pilot program. Others are exploring the possibility.\n\n\u201cThis is a quantum leap improvement over what has been the traditional model for how we ask for and receive identification,\u201d said Geoff Slagle, director of identity management at the motor vehicle administrators\u2019 association. \u201cWith this approach, I\u2019m able to verify that the MVA actually created that license for you and that it was overseen by them.\u201d\n\nOnly one state \u2014 New Mexico \u2014 does not allow drivers to use an electronic copy of their insurance card during a traffic stop, according to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\n\nSlagle said digital driver\u2019s licenses won\u2019t replace plastic ones; they\u2019ll simply be a supplement. Everybody still will have to carry a physical license for the foreseeable future. Eventually, officials envision people using digital licenses not only for traffic stops and airport ID but also in bars, grocery stores, casinos, banks, doctor\u2019s offices and as voter ID at polling places.\n\nAbout 35,000 of Louisiana\u2019s approximately 4 million drivers have signed up to have their license available on the LA Wallet app, said Paige Paxton, a field administrator for the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles. And on Election Day, the secretary of state\u2019s office allowed voters to display digital licenses instead of plastic ones.\n\n\u201cWe like to move with the times. We saw the potential,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cOur plan is to eventually make it so your registration, insurance or any credential would be on LA Wallet.\u201d\n\nThe program was jointly designed by the motor vehicles office, the Louisiana State Police and the Department of Public Safety. It was developed for free by Envoc, a Louisiana software firm, Paxton said, and there has been no cost to the state.\n\nLouisiana residents can download the Apple or Google app for free but must pay a $5.99 activation fee (most of which goes to the software developer; the rest to Google or Apple) that covers them until their driver\u2019s license expires.\n\nDrivers must use a PIN number, fingerprint or both to access their license, which is linked to the DMV data system.\n\n\u201cThis is not a static thing,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a live connect.\u201d\n\nFor now, the app only can be used for stops by Louisiana police and for voting, and drivers still must carry a physical license for the foreseeable future, Paxton said. Louisiana\u2019s Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control is developing a policy and training materials for its officers.\n\nLA Wallet was developed after the state legislature passed a measure in 2016 allowing the creation of digitized licenses as an alternative to physical ones.\n\nTo address privacy concerns, the law says that displaying a digital license doesn\u2019t serve as consent or authorization for police or anyone else to search or view any other data or app on the mobile device.\n\nAnd at the request of state police, Paxton said, the policy goes even further: Under its hands-off procedure, police can check the license without having to take the phone from the driver.\n\n\u201cOur state police were concerned,\u201d Paxton said, \u201cthat there was a potential that someone could say, \u2018Hey, you broke my phone.\u2019 So, who\u2019s liable for that if a screen is shattered?\u201d\n\nSo far, the system has been working just fine for state troopers, said Lt. Nick Manale, a Louisiana State Police spokesman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not aware of any problems with it, as long as the driver has cellphone connectivity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they always have a physical driver\u2019s license as a backup.\u201d\n\nThe app, which Paxton said does not track users\u2019 location, also is built so the screen only shows what\u2019s needed. If a store clerk or bouncer scans it, for example, the app would show only whether the person is old enough to drink.\n\nBut critics such as the ACLU\u2019s Marlow are skeptical that digital licenses in Louisiana or anywhere else are a good idea.\n\nBy unlocking the license, phone owners could expose their data to whoever is checking it, Marlow said. And, he added, while an officer normally would need a warrant to search a phone, in the real world, drivers who don\u2019t know the law could be pressured into handing over the phone, allowing access to everything from contacts to text messages.\n\nAnd he worries hackers could access data being transmitted to and from the DMV database.\n\nStandardizing Licenses\n\nA group formed by the motor vehicle administrators\u2019 association has been working on a plan to provide standards that would make it possible for digital licenses to work across states. This way, a license from one state could be checked and verified by a device in another.\n\nWyoming is one of several states that joined a pilot last year to test digital licenses. As part of the first phase, Wyoming officials wanted to see, for example, whether information could be transferred from a tractor-trailer digital driver\u2019s license directly to a highway patrol officer\u2019s cruiser behind the truck.\n\nIt worked, said Misty Zimmerman, a deputy program manager at the Wyoming Department of Transportation.\n\nWyoming is now planning the second phase of its pilot program.\n\n\u201cThe first phase was very smooth. There were no hurdles whatsoever,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cWe have not made any formal commitment [to offer digital licenses to the public]. However, from a department standpoint, I feel we would greatly benefit from having this option for our citizens.\u201d\n\nIowa, which in 2016 became the first state to start a digital license pilot program, is moving ahead with its plan to offer mobile licenses, turning to a system that uses biometrics and beefed-up security.\n\nThe state hired a French multinational company that specializes in providing secure credentials, IDEMIA, to develop the pilot for just under $50,000, said Mark Lowe, director of the state Department of Transportation.\n\nAnd after a competitive bidding process for the current digital license project, Iowa awarded the company a contract of about $1.2 million initially. It hopes to start the digital license program by late 2019 or early 2020.\n\nThe driver\u2019s app would be able to interact with another device used by the person checking the license. The device-to-device exchange would authorize information sharing and verify that the person is who he says he is.\n\n\u201cThe really powerful thing is that once we bind you to that credential and verify it, you can use it for hunting and fishing licenses, weapons\u2019 permits, tax returns \u2014 all sorts of things,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of convenience and efficiencies.\u201d\n\nIowa is working with other states to make sure that the system it is developing can be used outside of the state. Lowe said that\u2019s the biggest hurdle \u2014 developing common standards for digital licenses across states.\n\nBut privacy advocates are concerned about states creating digital license programs that use device-to-device communications rather than just scanning a barcode, as is done in airports and grocery stores.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u20181984\u2019 stuff,\u201d said Alan Butler, senior counsel at the Washington, D.C.-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research group. \u201cYou\u2019re opening up a new channel of attack or breach or nonconsensual monitoring of a person. It creates substantial privacy and data security risks with no added benefit.\u201d\n\nAnd the ACLU\u2019s Marlow worries about expanding the use of digital licenses.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stored on your physical driver\u2019s license is limited,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cBut the digital one has the potential to store a lot more information, and that could be hacked.\u201d\n\nBut Slagle, of the motor vehicle administrators\u2019 group, said the ACLU should be more concerned about plastic licenses, which are vulnerable to fraud and counterfeiting. \u201cThey should be super excited about something coming along that helps to solve some of those problems,\u201d he said.\n\nSlagle and Lowe predict that every state eventually will offer digital licenses."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Like Most Mass Shootings, The Chicago Hospital Attack Began With Domestic Violence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-hospital-shooting-domestic-violence_us_5bf41a91e4b0376c9e68fb00", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Lopez had no criminal record, but he\u2019d shown warning signs of instability and misogyny in the past.

Councilman Peter Koo, a lawmaker from the Flushing area of eastern Queens, said he would be the bill\u2019s first co-sponsor.\n\nThe bill takes a more ambitious approach than what was set out in August under a first-of-its-kind agreement between the city\u2019s real estate lobby and affordable housing advocates to support legislation that would mandate 80 percent cuts to big building\u2019s pollution by 2050. If the same coalition backs the legislation, it\u2019s expected to pass sometime in the coming months.\n\nThe Real Estate Board of New York, the city\u2019s powerful and deep-pocketed landlord lobby, did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would support the goals in the final legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lively hearing in December,\u201d Constantinides said, referring to debate on the bill next month. But on its hopes of passing, he said, \u201cI feel very confident right now.\u201d\n\nAlexander C. Kaufman / HuffPost New York City Councilman Costa Constantinides, flanked by housing advocates and environmentalists, announces the introduction of his bill three months after he first said he'd draft legislation to cut emissions from big buildings 80 percent by 2050.\n\nStarting in 2022, the new legislation proposes cutting pollution 40 percent by 2030, a timeline roughly twice as fast as the original agreement brokered by the Urban Green Council, a nonprofit linked to the U.S. Green Building Council that published the framework as a report three months ago. It\u2019ll establish a new Office of Building Energy Performance under the Department of Buildings and set up a 27-member advisory board to guide future emissions cuts through 2050.\n\n\u201cWe can be stricter in requirements, but at this point, we can\u2019t be any looser,\u201d Constantinides said.\n\nThe bill offers protections for the city\u2019s dwindling stock of roughly 990,000 rent-regulated apartments, sparing landlords who own those buildings from expensive retrofit requirements that could be legally passed onto tenants in the form of rent increases of up to 6 percent a year. Instead, the legislation proposes requiring the same auditing for to all buildings over 25,000 square feet that buildings over 50,000 square feet already undergo, a step that avoids rent hikes but increases pressure to decrease energy use in the structures.\n\nThe legislation could change next year if the new Democratic majority in both houses of the state legislature passes stronger tenant protections by the time the state\u2019s rent regulations expire in June.\n\n\u201cWe can retrofit the bill to reflect that,\u201d Constantinides said. But said the city won\u2019t wait for Albany to enact the legislation.\n\nThe bill\u2019s ambition matches that of universal health care proposals like Medicare for all, whereas the original agreement was closer to the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, said Pete Sikora, a senior adviser to the grassroots nonprofit New York Communities for Change.\n\n\u201cI gotta hand it to him: It\u2019s awesome,\u201d Sikora said of Constantinides, noting that the legislation matches the urgency set out by last month\u2019s United Nations report warning that world governments must halve emissions in the next 12 years to avoid catastrophic global warming.\n\nThis rises to the challenge of the U.N.\u2019s report. It\u2019s truly amazing and desperately needed. Pete Sikora, senior adviser to New York Communities for Change\n\n\u201cThis rises to the challenge of the U.N.\u2019s report,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s truly amazing and desperately needed.\u201d\n\nThe bill follows two attempts by Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) to mandate emissions cuts from privately owned buildings, first in 2016 and then again in 2017. The plans went nowhere.

Seth Moulton has earned plenty of praise. He upset an incumbent accused of corruption in a Democratic primary in 2014 while downplaying his heroics as a Marine in Iraq. His support from top military officials \u2015 he served as an aide to former Gen. David Petraeus \u2015 and willingness to buck his own\u2019s party\u2019s leadership made him the subject of national magazine profiles and 2020 presidential speculation. He was the very image of a Democratic rising star.\n\nNow, as that willingness to criticize top Democratic officials reaches its peak with his leadership of a coup against likely House Speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi, Moulton is feeling the backlash. At a town hall in his district on Massachusetts\u2019 North Shore on Monday night, activists confronted Moulton with accusations of sexism and ageism, mirroring the assault he\u2019s facing from Pelosi allies in Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally pissed off,\u201d said Linda Christian, 80, a retired lawyer who sharply questioned Moulton at the event. \u201cI voted for him. I like this man. I think he\u2019s shown, if not animus, stupidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe feels women are disposable, and elderly people are disposable,\u201d she continued.\n\nMoulton said sticking with the party\u2019s core House leadership \u2015 including the 78-year-old Pelosi and Reps. Steny Hoyer, 79, and James Clyburn, 78 \u2015 would be ignoring the lessons of the Democratic wave in the 2018 midterm elections, at least as he understands them.\n\n\u201cThe American people cried out for change in this election,\u201d Moulton said at the town hall, referencing the LGBTQ people, military veterans and people of color who won seats in the House this month. \u201cI think if our party answers that call for change with the same status quo leadership team we\u2019ve had in place since 2006, we\u2019re failing the American people.\u201d\n\nBoston Globe via Getty Images Activists supporting Nancy Pelosi's bid for speaker of the House are causing problems back home for Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts.\n\nNot all of the more than 100 constituents who filled this 17,000-person city\u2019s town hall were there to lambast Moulton. A roughly equal number expressed support for his stance against Pelosi\u2019s continued leadership of House Democrats. But the hourlong event focused almost exclusively on the speakership battle \u2015 a lone question from a city council member about sewage overflow notwithstanding \u2015 and the fracas shows the political risk of Moulton\u2019s decision to lead the anti-Pelosi forces. Activists in his district and operatives across the country who once supported him are now talking of recruiting a primary challenger to him in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf we could do a CrowdPac for Susan Collins\u2019 challenger, why couldn\u2019t we do one for a challenger to him?\u201d asked Bambi Snodgrass, who helped organize the pro-Pelosi protest and said she had knocked on more than 1,000 doors for Moulton\u2019s campaigns.\n\nMoulton and the other Democratic rebels opposing Pelosi on Monday released a letter with 16 signatories pledging to oppose their party\u2019s leader both in the Democratic caucus vote and on the floor of the House. Roughly nine other Democrats \u2015 many of them military vets who unseated GOP incumbents with Moulton\u2019s support \u2015 have also said they wouldn\u2019t support her. The exact size of the Democratic caucus is still uncertain, but there\u2019s likely enough opposition to cause problems for Pelosi.\n\nWhile grassroots conservative activists largely backed tea party and House Freedom Caucus challenges to John Boehner\u2019s leadership, grassroots progressives like Snodgrass and the other protesters seem more likely to back the Democratic Party\u2019s established leadership. Indivisible, the network of local progressive groups that has played a major role in encouraging and organizing Democratic energy during the Trump era, endorsed Pelosi for speaker last week. That\u2019s a potential problem for Moulton and the other rebels, who largely hail from the center of the political spectrum. Just two of the anti-Pelosi letter\u2019s signatories are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nThe Democratic Party appears split on the Pelosi question. A CBS News poll released on Monday night found 49 percent of Democrats want Pelosi to continue as speaker, 40 percent would prefer another Democrat and 10 percent are undecided.\n\nThe divide was visible in Amesbury.\n\n\u201cThe implication, that just because I\u2019m a white man, that I\u2019m being sexist just because I\u2019m opposed to 16 years of two people basically running the Democratic side of Congress, I resent that,\u201d one man said at the town hall.\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, has steadfastly insisted she feels no threat from the second-term Moulton and his allies, including Ohio Reps. Tim Ryan and Marcia Fudge. \u201cI will be speaker of the House no matter what Seth Moulton says,\u201d she boasted last week.\n\nDemocratic sources said Pelosi\u2019s team has dispatched California Rep. Ted Lieu, a veteran and Pelosi ally, to lobby the freshmen military veterans who Moulton helped recruit, including Reps.-elect Jason Crow of Colorado and Jared Golden of Maine.\n\nMoulton expressed confidence the newly elected members would keep their campaign trail promise not to back Pelosi, and predicted a quiet plurality of the Democratic caucus would prevent her from rising to a second stint as speaker."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump\u2019s Old Tweets About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Email Look Really Bad For Ivanka Trump", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ivanka-hillary-clinton-email_us_5bf39915e4b0d9e7283c7a63", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "Old tweets written by President Donald Trump\u2019s about Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server aren\u2019t aging very well.\n\nOn Monday, The Washington Post reported that Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter and an official adviser, used her personal email account for government business hundreds of times last year in violation of federal records rules.\n\nYet Trump made Clinton\u2019s emails a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and often referred to her as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d He also called Clinton \u201cunfit\u201d and \u201cincompetent,\u201d and slammed her for \u201cpoor judgement\u201d (sic) over the issue.\n\n\u201cWho would trust these people with national security?\u201d he asked in one tweet.\n\nClinton\u2019s email practices are also a prime driver of the \u201clock her up\u201d chants that continue to erupt at Trump\u2019s events.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s old tweets are being looked at in a new light:\n\nHow can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? \u2014 Donald J.

Then, this past October, The New York Times obtained a memo indicating that the administration was considering narrowly defining gender \u201cas a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth.\u201d Anyone wishing to challenge their officially-assigned sex would have to have the matter resolved by genetic testing.\n\nThose opposed to recognizing gender identity sometimes call it a form of \u201cradical gender ideology\u201d or \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d gone too far.\n\nBut recognition of transgender identity is no recent phenomenon: Some doctors acknowledged gender nonconforming people far earlier than most might realize. Perhaps the most important pioneer was German physician Magnus Hirschfeld, who was born 150 years ago, in 1868. As a historian of gender and sexuality in Germany, I\u2019m struck by how he paved the way for the legal recognition of gender nonconforming people.\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld, on the right, sits with his partner, Tao Li, at the fourth conference of the World League for Sexual Reform in 1932. Wellcome Images, CC BY\n\nHirschfeld\u2019s \u2018sexual intermediaries\u2019\n\nIn recent years, the medical and psychological professions have come to a consensus that sex assignment at birth is inadequate for understanding individuals\u2019 sexual and gender identity \u2013 and that failure to recognize this fact can have a devastating impact.\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld was the first doctor to openly research and advocate for people whose gender did not correspond with their sex assignment at birth.\n\nHe\u2019s often remembered today as an advocate of gay rights, and in the early 20th century, his activism played a major role in nearly overturning Germany\u2019s law criminalizing male same-sex relations.\n\nBut Hirschfeld\u2019s vision extended much further than homosexuality. He defined his specialty as \u201csexual intermediaries,\u201d which included everyone who did not fit into an \u201cideal type\u201d of heterosexual, cis-gendered men and women.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, sexual intermediaries included many categories. One type was cis-gendered people who were gay, lesbian or bisexual. Another consisted of transvestites: people who comfortably identified as their assigned sex but who preferred to dress in the clothing assigned to the other sex. Yet others were \u201ctrans\u201d in a more radical direction, like those who wanted to live fully as their non-assigned sex or longed for sex-change surgery.\n\nA relentless advocate\n\nAs a gay man, Hirschfeld was aware of the legal and social dangers sexual intermediaries faced.\n\nSince sexual intermediaries often turned to their doctors for help, Hirschfeld worked to educate the medical community. He published medical journals including the \u201cYearbook on Sexual Intermediaries\u201d and the \u201cJournal of Sexual Science.\u201d In 1919, he founded the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin to promote further research.\n\nIn court he gave expert testimony on behalf of men who had been accused of violating Germany\u2019s law banning male same-sex relations.\n\nHe even co-wrote and made a cameo appearance in the world\u2019s first feature-length movie featuring a gay protagonist: the 1919 silent film \u201cAnders als die Anderen\u201d (\u201cDifferent from the Others\u201d).\n\nNor did Hirschfeld shy away from political engagement. In 1897, he founded the \u201cScientific Humanitarian Committee\u201d to advocate for gender and sexual rights.\n\nThen, from 1897 to 1898, Hirschfeld worked to decriminalize male same-sex relations in Germany. He collected over 5,000 signatures from Germans willing to be publicly identified with the effort, including such luminaries as Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. A bill decriminalizing male homosexual acts gained only minority support when it was introduced in Parliament in 1898, but a new bill was reintroduced after the First World War. In the more progressive environment of the Weimar Republic, the bill advanced to parliamentary committee, only to stall when the Great Depression hit in 1929.\n\nImportantly, Hirschfeld\u2019s advocacy extended well beyond the decriminalization of gay male sex.\n\nLike most European countries, Germany had \u2013 and still has \u2013 an \u201cinternal passport,\u201d a government-issued ID that citizens are expected to carry with them. Germans whose passport indicated \u201cmale\u201d but who dressed in female clothing were subject to police harassment or arrest for disorderly conduct.\n\nTogether with a colleague, Hirschfeld in 1910 convinced the Berlin police to accept a \u201ctransvestite certificate,\u201d signed by a doctor, to nullify such charges. After World War I, he convinced the Prussian judiciary to permit legal name changes from gender-specific names to gender-neutral names, which enabled trans people to present as the gender that was most true to themselves.\n\nNot all sexual minorities in Germany endorsed Hirschfeld\u2019s views. Early twentieth-century Germany was a politically and culturally diverse place, and that diversity extended to same-sex and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nSome gay men, for example, argued that far from being an \u201cintermediary\u201d sexual type, they were the most masculine men of all: After all, they didn\u2019t form close bonds with women. The vision of these \u201cmasculinists\u201d had little room for lesbians, bisexuals, or trans people.\n\nA life\u2019s work goes up in flames\n\nBy contrast, Hirschfeld\u2019s approach was all-inclusive. In his view, all \u201csexual intermediaries\u201d \u2013 whether L, G, B, T, Q, or I in today\u2019s parlance \u2013 were worth recognizing and protecting. He once calculated that there were 43,046,721 possible variants of human sexuality. That was simply another way of saying that the human species was infinitely diverse.\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d he said, \u201cis as varied as people are.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hirschfeld, who was Jewish, was on tour lecturing on sexual science. From abroad, he watched newsreels of his Institute for Sexual Science set aflame by Nazi Storm Troopers. Thousands of unique medical records, publications, photos and artifacts were destroyed.\n\nStudents organized by the Nazi party parade in front of the building of the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin prior to pillaging it on May 6, 1933. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nHirschfeld died two years later, and materials confiscated by the Nazis became evidence against gender and sexually-nonconforming people in the Third Reich. Male same-sex relations weren\u2019t decriminalized in East Germany until 1968, and in West Germany until 1969. Full legal equality had to wait even longer.\n\nNearly a century after Hirschfeld\u2019s institute burned, only tentative progress has been made in ending discrimination based on gender identity. And that progress is at risk.\n\nYet no bureaucratic definition of \u201csex\u201d will change what Hirschfeld so clearly demonstrated over 120 years ago: Trans people exist."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Now That I Can Only Eat With A Feeding Tube, Thanksgiving Has A New Meaning For Me", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feeding-tube-thanksgiving_us_5be48070e4b0e84388956371", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "For most of my life, the idea of healthy eating flew out the window on Thanksgiving Day. Like most Americans, I would eat myself sick.\n\nBut seven years ago, throat cancer stole my ability to eat. After a 15-hour surgery rooting through arteries and nerves, I was left with a crater in my right temple and an inability to swallow even a sip of water. The doctors surgically installed a permanent feeding tube next to my bellybutton so I could pump liquid protein and receive all of my nutrition. I had survived the surgery and the cancer had been removed, but I was far from OK.\n\nI had never had a complicated relationship with food \u2015 rather, it had been a reciprocal love affair. I relished cooking, entertaining and being served the finest, freshest food available.\n\nThe natural rhythm of my day, from coffee to 5 p.m. wine, suddenly was gone. I was the one who had to shop for and cook for my family, and I longed for the feel of food in my mouth, as well as for the joy of breaking bread with friends and family. Depression blossomed. I lost my sense of humor, and the enthusiasm I\u2019d had for my lucky life as a stay-at-home mom who was married to a great man. I lost all sense of joy.\n\nWe are what we eat, the saying goes, but we are so much more. What we consume, what we choose to think about, affects our souls deeply. It can mean the difference between happiness and suffering.\n\nHolidays were the worst, especially Thanksgiving. All the Thanksgivings I\u2019ve hosted in my wonderful old house have blended together in my memory because my family does the exact same thing every year \u2015 and it\u2019s based on the overabundance of food, stemming from our Italian heritage.\n\nMy first Thanksgiving without being able to eat was disturbing, overwhelming and completely unraveling. The challenge of not eating on a day that has always been focused on food seemed insurmountable. I sulked and stayed in my room for most of the time. I could hear the din of laughter in the dining room, the joy that comes from food and coats the pain and injustice of life. I cried, and then went downstairs to try to show that this giant problem was really no problem at all.\n\nIn the seven years since my stomach tube was put into place, I have listened to many sermons, taken hundreds of yoga classes, studied spiritual awakening books and been in therapy. I\u2019ve learned to try to let go of fear, commit to unconditional happiness, love what is and not be controlling. The message is loud and clear in our contemporary spiritual supermarket: clinging to an idea or having an expectation can kill a moment, or a day or a lifetime.\n\nHowever, implementing those beliefs is not as easy as intellectually understanding the concepts behind them. It takes discipline and meditation and intention. Inspired by my children, I decided to do the work. They needed a real mom, not a zombie mom. I forced myself to climb my way out of a very deep hole and to find a new way of thinking and living.\n\nBut Thanksgiving was still the day I seemed to forget everything I thought I\u2019d learned.\n\nGradually, over the years, I came to realize that I could, in fact, consume other things. I could consume things in my surroundings \u2015 my comfortable home, or intellectually stimulating creative endeavors that fed my mind, like painting or reading a great book. We are what we eat, the saying goes, but we are so much more. What we consume, what we choose to think about, affects our souls deeply. It can mean the difference between happiness and suffering. There is this choice.\n\nThe walls of my favorite holiday tradition began to crumble, and new ones began to be built.\n\nThere is also a physical element of being deprived of eating with my mouth. With every small bite of food or sip of wine, the body releases chemicals that makes us feel good. But feeding the brain with appreciation for sunsets, flowers and friendships \u2015 delicacies for our soul \u2015 produces the same good chemicals. I have come to believe that the diet of my thoughts can and must be selected very, very carefully.\n\nWith my decision made \u2015 and that\u2019s the key, making the decision \u2015 there has been progress. But to conquer the fortress of Thanksgiving, I had to practice for seven years to stop fantasizing about something that wasn\u2019t going to happen. It took training, as for a marathon. Slowly, though, the walls of my favorite holiday tradition began to crumble, and new ones began to be built.\n\nSo last Thanksgiving I decided I was going to have a zero-calorie, zero-resentment version of the old tradition. It would be a spiritual banquet for me.\n\nI began the tradition by remembering that Thanksgiving is not a national holiday founded on food. It\u2019s about gratitude. My family typically has been especially grateful for the appetizers \u2015 fresh ricotta cheese, mozzarella made the day before by an old Italian man who learned from his mother, prosciutto and bread and dried peppers soaked in oil and hot pepper flakes. Things that would be a meal on any other day. But last year, I thought about them with my new focus. I thought about how it was the only time of the entire year where my brother and sister stood around the table in my home to be with my family for two days.\n\nI began the tradition by remembering that Thanksgiving is not a national holiday founded on food. It\u2019s about gratitude.\n\nWhen the appetizer frenzy began early in the day and the long kitchen farm table was loaded with treasures from Arthur Avenue, my loved ones became my treasures.\n\nI was nourished by the fact that I\u2019d brought everyone together. When they were loading up their pieces of bread with fresh ricotta, I loaded up on their joyful energy. My son gave me several warm gravy hugs during the day; my daughter\u2019s personality, as she peppered the day with a few sarcastic comments, made me smile. I drank in the love of my husband like I was slowly sipping a full-bodied Barollo. I was aware my stomach remained empty, but I did not focus on it. Better for me. No one acknowledged my ongoing struggle with food, and I simply stopped feeling mad about that.\n\nMy banquet was all easily digested, no bloating or weight gain. At the end of the day, I felt full in a new way. I had feasted on the joy of sitting with my sister and brother, people I started out my life with and with whom I felt a tribal communion, beings who had inhabited the planet with me for my entire life. Our collective experience was all the nourishment I needed. A silent prayer of gratitude was the dessert.\n\nI\u2019d won the lottery, beaten impossible odds, and I still got to be here to see and feel it all. That was grace, no matter what I thought my life should be. And this is exactly how I plan to enjoy my Thanksgiving this year: full of gratitude."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Why You Should Teach Your Kids The Real Words For Private Parts", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kids-real-words-private-parts_us_5bf2e62ce4b0757388210397", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Michael H via Getty Images The conversation around body parts and bodily autonomy is an important one to have early on.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of serious conversations parents should have with their children. And in the age of the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements, one fundamental lesson is the importance of our bodies and bodily autonomy.\n\n\u201cBody awareness talks are the earliest conversations parents can have with young children to support their health and safety,\u201d sex educator Melissa Carnagey said. Conversations about body parts and bodily autonomy lay the foundation for understanding consent and sexual misconduct.\n\nTo inform these early discussions, HuffPost spoke to Carnagey and sex educator Lydia M. Bowers about the best ways to explore the topic of private parts and bodily autonomy with young kids.\n\nHere are their expert-backed guidelines and tips for parents and caregivers to keep in mind.\n\nUse The Proper Terms For Body Parts\n\n\u201cBody parts are body parts are body parts,\u201d Bowers said, emphasizing that \u201cpenis,\u201d \u201ctesticles,\u201d \u201cvulva\u201d and \u201cvagina\u201d are not bad words. Parents should become comfortable using these terms or the corresponding words if they speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\u201cOften without hesitation, caregivers will use accurate terms for body parts like elbow, knee and nose, so parts like the penis, vulva, vagina and anus should be no different,\u201d said Carnagey.\n\nThere are several reasons children should learn the proper terms for private parts instead of nicknames. One is that having the right language and context helps kids communicate clearly about their bodies. This is important in the context of telling a doctor or caregiver where something hurts or itches.\n\n\u201cWhen we avoid saying words, we instill a sense of shame, of something to be avoided or hidden.\u201d - Lydia M. Bowers, sex educator\n\n\u201cUsing accurate terms also better prepares them to talk confidently about changes they may experience to their body as they grow, especially to medical providers or in settings where they may be learning about their health,\u201d Carnagey added.\n\n\u201cWhen we avoid saying words, we instill a sense of shame, of something to be avoided or hidden,\u201d Bowers said. She added that using the correct terms is useful in teaching kids how to keep their bodies clean and healthy. \u201cFor proper hygiene, there\u2019s a difference in how the bottom or the penis or the vulva are wiped and washed.\u201d\n\nAvoid Cutesy Language\n\nAlthough it is tempting to use euphemisms and cutesy language when talking to little kids about their bodies, this can lead to problems.\n\n\u201cOne issue is that there are so many alternate terms and many of them have other meanings. This can be risky because it can lead to a child being misunderstood by others, especially if they have experienced unsafe touch to that part of their body and need to report it,\u201d said Carnagey.\n\nKids should be able to identify body parts as private and correctly name them so that they can communicate if they\u2019ve been touched inappropriately.\n\n\u201cWe sometimes give nicknames for body parts \u2015 like \u2018piggies\u2019 and \u2018noggin.\u2019 But just like we also teach children those parts are actually called \u2018toes\u2019 and \u2018head,\u2019 they need to know real private-part terms as well,\u201d Bowers explained. \u201cIf we\u2019re using cutesy names because we\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed to say the actual terms, we\u2019re perpetuating the idea that some body parts are dirty, bad or shameful.\u201d\n\nPromote Bodily Autonomy In Everyday Situations\n\n\u201cCreating a home culture where everyone\u2019s body boundaries are respected is an important step,\u201d Carnagey said. Parents can do this by not forcing their kids to share affection with others and by getting in the habit of asking for touch \u2015 for example, saying \u201cMay I give you a hug?\u201d rather than \u201cGive me a hug.\u201d\n\nCarnagey advised that parents not dismiss unwanted touch between siblings or family members as play.\n\n\u201cIn our home, for example, we have an agreement that no one should have to repeat \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018stop\u2019 before the boundary is respected,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt may take some reminding and redirecting at first, but when it\u2019s consistently practiced, children become more mindful of the boundaries of others and come to expect theirs to be respected as well.\u201d\n\nParents and caregivers can promote bodily autonomy in everyday circumstances like mealtimes. \u201cWhen a child says that they are full or finished eating, avoiding a power struggle by not forcing them to take one more bite or finish their plate honors what their body is telling them,\u201d said Carnagey.\n\nBowers pointed out that there are opportunities to teach these lessons while reading books or watching movies. Parents can say things like, \u201cShould that prince have kissed the princess when she was sleeping? She wasn\u2019t able to say yes or no.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, there are times that parents should not insist on asking for permission, however, like when changing diapers, taking kids to the doctor to receive medical care and bathing young children before they\u2019re able to do it on their own.\n\n\u201cIf we ask a child, \u2018May I change your diaper?\u2019 and they respond with \u2018no,\u2019 we\u2019re left with two options. Either we violate their consent or we leave them in a dirty diaper, which is a health and safety hazard,\u201d she explained. \u201cInstead, we talk through with them. \u2018It\u2019s time to change your diaper. Your body did its job to get that out, and now we\u2019re going to take off the dirty diaper. I\u2019m going to use this wipe. \u2026\u2019 We can still show them that their body is worth respect, that we will be intentional and inform of the process.\u201d\n\nUse Books And Videos\n\nEducate to Empower Publishing Many children\u2019s books \u2014 for example, Jayneen Sanders\u2019 My Body! What I Say Goes! \u2014 promote themes of bodily autonomy and safety.\n\nEducate2Empower Publishing, Sanders\u2019 publisher, is a great resource for families because it is an imprint specializing in children\u2019s books on body safety, consent, gender equality, respectful relationships and social and emotional intelligence.\n\nCarnagey\u2019s Sex Positive Families website features a reading list of over 100 books on sexual health for children and families, including many that tackle consent and bodily autonomy.\n\nBeyond books, the Animated Child, an enrichment center in Virginia, offers a video version of My Body! What I Say Goes! and others on consent and safety. Amaze produces useful videos to inform these kinds of conversations as well.\n\nTeach Kids To Trust Their Instincts\n\nThere are ways to help kids learn to trust their instincts, which can be a fundamental step in teaching bodily autonomy and contextualizing difficult experiences.\n\n\u201cBeing in the habit of checking in and making space to hear from them how they are doing in a moment is a great way to help increase their body awareness and language around their experiences.\u201d - Melissa Carnagey, sex educator\n\nCarnagey suggested teaching kids to identify their feelings. Parents and caregivers can do this by asking questions like \u201cHow are you feeling right now?\u201d or pointing out when they notice shifts in body language with statements like \u201cI see that you\u2019re frowning. Tell me what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "'This Is Our Lane': Doctors Slam NRA After Chicago Hospital Shooting", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-chicago-hospital-shooting_us_5bf37b53e4b01909c808b7f4", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Less than two weeks after the National Rifle Association launched an attack on \u201cself-important anti-gun doctors,\u201d a mass shooting at a Chicago hospital left at least four people dead.\n\nEmergency room doctor Tamara O\u2019Neal, 38, and pharmaceutical assistant Dayna Less, 25, were shot and killed by an unidentified gunman following a domestic dispute at the Mercy Hospital & Medical Center on Monday.

As a result, Americans shoulder the highest drug prices in the world while receiving significantly poorer public health outcomes than most of the developed world.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to address that problem, but a new proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) would attack prescription drug price-gouging at the source: the government-granted monopoly that gives Big Pharma unchecked pricing power.\n\n\u201cNo other country allows pharmaceutical companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cSomebody in America today can walk into a pharmacy and find out that the medicine they have been using for years can double, triple or quadruple literally overnight. That needs to change.\u201d\n\nEvery year, the United States spends over $1,200 per person on pharmaceuticals, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That\u2019s more than double the rate in the United Kingdom and nearly double the rate in France \u2015 and yet the typical French citizen can expect to live more than four years longer than the typical American, and those in the United Kingdom enjoy three extra years, on average, relative to their American counterparts, according to the World Health Organization. The disparities are even more dramatic between the U.S. and Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn 2015, Bloomberg News compared different countries\u2019 spending on a host of major prescription drugs. A months\u2019 supply of the arthritis treatment Humira cost about $2,500 in the U.S. \u2015 roughly 50 percent more than the same supply of the same drug in Germany, and more than double the price in Canada and the U.K. The asthma medication Advair runs about $150 a month in the U.S. \u2014 roughly double the price of the same drug in Canada and triple its cost in Japan. For cutting-edge cancer drugs, prices in the U.S. exceed those in other countries by several thousand dollars per month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders and Khanna will unveil a new bill that would direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize generic competition for any name-brand drug whose average domestic cost exceeds the median price in five reference countries: Canada, the U.K., Germany, France and Japan.\n\n\u201cThe government is giving an exclusive monopoly to pharmaceuticals,\u201d Khanna told HuffPost. \u201cIf a company abuses that grant by fleecing American consumers, then they lose that privilege, that property grant, that subsidy from the government.\u201d\n\nIf the bill \u2014 dubbed The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act \u2014 were to become law, experts anticipate that drug companies would dramatically reduce prices rather than risk ceding market share to a generic competitor. \u201cNo company would want to lose its legal monopoly as a consequence of charging U.S. residents prices higher than in the reference countries,\u201d said Jamie Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that specializes in intellectual property issues.\n\nThe bill from Sanders and Khanna isn\u2019t going to become law anytime soon. It faces fervent opposition from Republicans, who will still control the Senate when Congress reconvenes next year. Even getting a vote in the House will depend on whether the Democrats in charge of key committees decide to greenlight it \u2015 a choice that will likely depend at least in part on the whims of top leadership.\n\nBut the legislation nevertheless sends a statement about the priorities of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and its intent to deliver on the campaign promises Democrats issued around the 2018 midterms, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s election night pledge to \u201ctake real, very, very strong legislative action to negotiate down the price control of prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development. We pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen\n\nPharmaceutical firms typically argue that long-term monopolies are necessary to justify the money they spend on research and development. And major drug companies do spend billions of dollars a year on R&D \u2015 but not nearly as much as they spend on marketing, meaning that most of the costs recouped by monopoly profits aren\u2019t essential to groundbreaking science. Nearly all research funded by pharmaceutical companies, moreover, piggybacks on government-backed research conducted by the National Institutes of Health. One study published earlier this year concluded that every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 relied on at least some government-funded research, reflecting over $100 billion of public investment.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a public interest nonprofit. \u201cWe pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers, and then stands aside as Big Pharma exploits those monopolies to price gouge.\u201d\n\nThe United States is in a class by itself on prescription drug costs, but the five reference countries included in the Sanders bill are a relatively generous comparison pool. Three of them \u2015 Germany, Japan and Canada \u2015 are in the top five in per-capita pharmaceutical spending among OECD nations. International reference pricing is common among wealthy nations, with 29 of 31 European Union nations taking foreign drug prices into account when considering domestic price policy, according to the European Commission.\n\nPatents on prescription drugs are a longstanding feature of both American law and international trade agreements, in part due to the outsized influence of the pharmaceutical lobby within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. But international law provides various exceptions patent-holders\u2019 privileges when it comes to public health \u2015 which is why so many countries party to the World Trade Organization and other trade treaties can obtain lower drug prices than the U.S. does. Though Khanna and Sanders crafted their bill to crack down on the monopoly, the legislation would not technically violate a drug company\u2019s patent \u2015 just change the legal substance of what that patent secured."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Executive Sheryl Sandberg Calls Explosive NYT Report 'Simply Untrue'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-new-york-times-facebook-report_us_5bee3e55e4b0510a1f2f524d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cI\u2019ve said many times before that we were too slow to spot Russian interference and we certainly stumbled along the way,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a press conference, \u201cbut to suggest we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth or wanted to hide what we knew or wanted to prevent investigations is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nThe platform also issued a separate statement on its blog Wednesday, announcing that it had severed ties with Definers.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf \u2015 or to spread misinformation,\u201d Facebook wrote. \u201cDefiners did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of \u2018Freedom from Facebook,\u2019 an anti-Facebook organization.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "In Extraordinary Statement, Trump Stands With Saudis Despite Khashoggi Killing", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-khashoggi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump declared his unswerving loyalty to Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Tuesday, saying that the prince\u2019s culpability in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi might never be known.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Mr. Trump said in a remarkable, eight-paragraph, exclamation-point laden statement that appeared calculated to end debate over the American response to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cWe may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the statement. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump dictated the sentiment in the statement, according to a senior administration official.

The answer, my friends, is that the appendix is turning out to contain biologically useful tissue that may help prevent nasty gastrointestinal ills.\n\nAs long ago as 1913, a British surgeon pointed out that the appendix is a mass of lymphoid tissue that most likely protects against harmful infections. \u201cThe vermiform appendix of man is not solely a vestigial structure,\u201d Dr. Edred M. Corner wrote in The British Medical Journal. \u201cOn the contrary, it is a specialized part of the alimentary canal, Nature having made use of a disappearing structure and endowed it with a secondary function by giving it lymphoid tissue to protect the body against the micro-organisms in the ileo-caecal region.\u201d\n\nNow, a century later, researchers have provided evidence in support of Dr. Corner, contradicting longstanding medical dogma to remove the appendix, not only when it\u2019s infected, but whenever surgery for some other reason renders it accessible. Sixteen years ago, when I was about to be operated on for a strangulated intestine, I was asked if I wanted my appendix removed at the same time.\n\nMy response was \u201cHell no! It might be useful.\u201d Though I could cite no biological evidence at the time, I suspected evolution didn\u2019t produce and preserve the appendix for no reason. As it turns out, Heather F. Smith, an evolutionary biologist, and colleagues at Midwestern University in Glendale, Ariz., have found convincing evidence that \u201cthe appendix had apparently evolved independently more than 30 times in the course of mammalian evolution, suggesting that it provided some kind of adaptive advantage,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cThe appendix, with its high concentration of lymphoid tissue, stimulates and supports the immune system, especially when pathogens invade the gastrointestinal tract,\u201d she explained. Furthermore, she suggested, we could do a lot better to preserve the health-promoting potential of this tissue.\n\nDr. Smith pointed out that, although great apes, several other primates and rodents have an appendix, only humans get appendicitis, a condition that predominantly afflicts people in industrialized nations who consume a Westernized high-carbohydrate, low-fiber diet that can result in calcified carbohydrate particles becoming trapped in the opening to the appendix."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Checkup: Baby Won\u2019t Sleep Through the Night?

Their studies have found that persistent co-sleeping is associated with less happy marriages and higher stress around co-parenting, though again, this is an association; there is no way to tease out cause and effect. Mothers, he said, \u201cappear to be particularly vulnerable to losing sleep,\u201d and may accumulate chronic sleep deficits, which may affect their well-being and their functioning as parents. \u201cA lot is going to depend on how the parent is reacting or responding,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things we tell parents is pay attention to your own sleep schedules, use good sleep hygiene.\u201d\n\nSome mothers can tolerate those deficits better than others, he said. \u201cNot everyone is showing stressed co-parenting or stressed marriages.\u201d Both members of the couple need to be on board with decisions about where the baby sleeps, and how night wakings will be handled, he said, and they should make sure they are taking time to nurture their own relationship.\n\nThe new study, like many other studies of variability and temperament and the different ways to take care of children, ought to be reassuring to everyone \u2014 children develop differently and there are lots of ways to grow up and be healthy.

Some go as far as to declare \u201csitting is the new smoking.\u201d In 2013, an American Medical Association board member said, \u201cProlonged sitting, particularly in work settings, can cause health problems, and encouraging workplaces to offer employees alternatives to sitting all day will help to create a healthier work force,\u201d and suggested that standing work stations should be one of the options.\n\nToo much sitting over the course of a day is not healthy \u2014 let\u2019s be clear.

Replacing sitting with standing does not fulfill that recommendation and may even mislead people into thinking they\u2019re doing enough activity.\n\nSit-stand desks are not exactly inexpensive, but like many things in life, they\u2019re fine if you like them. And if it helps alleviate some back and neck pain, so much the better. It\u2019s just that most people probably don\u2019t need them."}]
