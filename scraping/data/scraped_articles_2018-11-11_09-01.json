He said seven people were found in homes, and three were outside. Of the remaining four, two were in cars and two were in houses in an area known as Concow.\n\nSaturday brought a break in the fierce winds that have whipped the three major wildfires in California that have destroyed a record number of buildings and displaced more than 300,000 people.\n\nBut officials know the gusts will be back Sunday and most evacuation orders remain in place.\n\n\"Mother Nature has given us a short reprieve ... but we know tomorrow Mother Nature's gonna turn her fan back on and the winds are going to start blowing,\" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters. He said he cautioned his firefighters and the public not to be lulled by the better weather Saturday.\n\n\"Stay vigilant,\" he said.\n\nFire has killed nine people in Northern California and possibly two in Southern California. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Chief John Benedict said the charred remains of two people were found in a car in Malibu, but homicide investigators were still working the case.\n\nWinds could gust as high as 30 to 50 mph, depending on elevation, on Sunday, officials said. Much of the state hasn't seen rain in more than a month, according to CNN meteorologists, and the dry vegetation has only served to fuel the fires.\n\nLatest developments\n\n\u2022 Burning and growing: The Camp Fire is the largest of the three major fires, swelling to 105,000 acres by Saturday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. It is the most destructive blaze in the state's modern history. The Woolsey Fire doubled in size overnight, growing to 70,000 acres. The Hill Fire was at 4,500 acres.\n\nTrump tweets: President Donald Trump : President Donald Trump blamed the wildfires on the \"gross mismanagement of the forests\" in a tweet early Saturday. \"Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\" he said. In another tweet sent Saturday he wrote: \"Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God bless them all.\"\n\n\u2022 Massive evacuations: Fire officials estimate the number of people forced from their homes statewide is more than 300,000; in Los Angeles County it is 170,000.\n\n\u2022 Containment: Firefighters are struggling to put down the flames. The Camp Fire is 20% contained, while the Woolsey Fire is just 5% contained. The Hill Fire was 25% contained.\n\n\u2022 Destruction: In Northern California, nearly 7,000 structures have been destroyed, including 80% to 90% of the homes in Paradise, north of Sacramento, according to officials. In Los Angeles and Ventura counties, a significant number of homes were destroyed or damaged, fire officials said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Scorched hillsides and damaged power lines are seen along the Pacific Coast Highway near Leo Carrillo State Beach in Malibu, California, on Saturday, November 10, after the Woosley Fire tore through the area overnight. The Ventura County Fire Department said the Woolsey Fire had burned around 35,000 acres and that evacuation orders were issued for roughly 88,000 homes in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties.

Hide Caption 47 of 47\n\nCamp Fire\n\nThe Camp Fire has killed at least nine people in Paradise and destroyed 6,453 structures.\n\nThe bodies of five people were found in or near a vehicle, and the other four were in or outside a home.\n\nIt took just a few hours for the fire to explode in size after breaking out early Thursday morning. Among the communities hit was Paradise, a town about 80 miles north of Sacramento.\n\nFamilies raced to escape the blaze as it consumed much of the town. Footage captured by evacuees showed flames along roads, scorching trees and devouring houses.\n\n\"The flames were whipping and spreading so fast,\" Whitney Vaughan said after fleeing her home in Paradise . \"It began to jump the road. There wasn't anywhere to go.\"\n\nThe town was mostly empty, and the main road littered with downed trees and power lines. Burnt out cars line blackened roadsides, abandoned in the panic and chaos of the evacuations.\n\n\"We do intend to rebuild,\" Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said. \"It's going to be a process -- a lot of hard work, a lot of coming together.\n\n\"We want to see Paradise be Paradise again.\"\n\nAn estimated 52,000 people evacuated in Butte County, where Paradise is located.\n\nFire officials said three firefighters and some civilians were hurt, but details about their injuries were unknown. About 35 people have been reported missing, authorities said.\n\nWoolsey Fire\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled in Ventura County and in Malibu in Los Angeles County due to the Woolsey Fire, officials said.\n\nFirefighters worked to protect thousands of students and staff sheltering in place Saturday at Pepperdine University as flames started reaching the campus overnight, school officials said.\n\nLos Angeles County firefighters are battling the Woolsey fire near Malibu.\n\nThe fire crossed US 101 a few miles east of Thousand Oaks -- the site of Wednesday night's bar shooting -- and was headed south to the Pacific coast in the direction of Malibu Creek State Park and the city of Malibu, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.\n\nIn Malibu, mandatory evacuations were ordered for the entire city of about 12,000 people that's known for its celebrity beachside homes.\n\nTwo people were arrested in looting incidents Friday during the evacuations, according to Ventura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow.\n\nThe howling Santa Ana winds fueled the Woolsey Fire. These are strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area.\n\nFire officials said the winds had temporarily died down Saturday, giving them a brief opportunity to make progress.\n\n\"This is just a lull,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said, \"so we're going to take advantage of that and try to get as much line perimeter in as we can with the expectation that we will get more winds tomorrow.\"\n\nAnother round of Santa Ana winds is forecast to whip the area Sunday through Tuesday, though it may be weaker than Friday's.\n\nHill Fire\n\n\"It's been a brutal, hellish three days for the city of Thousand Oaks,\" City Councilwoman Claudia Bill-de la Pe\u00f1a said at a news conference on Saturday.\n\nA bridge paved with asphalt near Agoura Hills, California, was also heavily damaged.\n\nThe fire started Thursday and initially spread quickly, torching 10,000 acres in six hours. But firefighters have made some progress.\n\nPart of the fast-moving blaze was burning into the footprint of a 2013 wildfire, which could slow its spread, chief Lorenzen said.\n\nNo houses or businesses have been lost, but a number of RVs and outbuildings have been burned, and a firefighter suffered a minor injury, authorities said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump's tweet on wildfires angers firefighters, celebrities", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/M98qdY1CY84/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's tweet blaming \"gross mismanagement\" for the devastating California wildfires is sparking backlash from top firefighters' associations, politicians and celebrities.\n\nIn a series of tweets Saturday, Trump said the state's deadly wildfires are a result of \"poor\" forest management and threatened to cut federal aid.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\" Trump tweeted. \"Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.

Or he had a peaceful death,\" Abdullah Khashoggi, 33, told CNN during a sit-down interview in Washington with his brother, Salah, 35.\n\nAuthorities in Turkey -- who say Khashoggi was murdered by a hit squad sent from Riyadh -- are still searching for the journalist's remains. Earlier this week, the chief prosecutor's office said Khashoggi's body was dismembered after he was strangled, while the Washington Post reported investigators were looking into the theory that the body was dissolved in acid. A source close to the Saudi Royal Palace has denied any knowledge of the body's whereabouts.\n\nWithout their father's body, the brothers say their family is unable to grieve or find closure.\n\n\"All what we want right now is to bury him in Al-Baqi (cemetery) in Medina (Saudi Arabia) with the rest of his family,\" Salah said.\n\n\"I talked about that with the Saudi authorities and I just hope that it happens soon.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has presented an evolving narrative about what happened to Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen, when he entered the consulate to get papers for his wedding; the journalist was preparing to get married for a third time. Authorities initially denied all knowledge of his fate before later admitting that a group of rogue operators, many part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's inner circle, were responsible. Riyadh has maintained that neither bin Salman nor his father, King Salman, knew of the operation to target Khashoggi.\n\nBut what has really come to trouble his two sons, their two sisters and their mother are the lies, they say, that have sprung up since Khashoggi's death.\n\nAbdullah and Salah say their father has been misunderstood and intentionally misrepresented for political reasons.\n\n\"Jamal was a moderate person. He was liked by everybody. He had differences and common values with everyone,\" Salah said, describing Khashoggi as a genuine, happy person and an \"amazing\" father.\n\n\"I see a lot of people coming out right now and trying to claim his legacy and unfortunately some of them are using that in a political way that we totally don't agree with.\"\n\n\"Public opinion is important... but my fear is that it's being over politicized. People are throwing analysis that may direct us away from the truth.\"\n\nJamal Khashoggi, looks on during a press conference in the Bahraini capital Manama, on December 15, 2014.\n\nKhashoggi was labeled as a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer and a dangerous Islamist in phone calls the Saudi crown prince had with Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and Middle East adviser, and John Bolton, national security adviser, according to reports in both the Washington Post and New York Times. The Muslim Brotherhood, considered a terror group in many Arab nations, but not the US or Europe, has long been seen as an existential threat by the desert kingdom's leaders.\n\n\"It's just labels and people not doing their homework properly, and reading his article and going in depth. It's easier to stick a label on him,\" Abdullah said, when asked about the Muslim Brotherhood claim.\n\nAsked how Khashoggi should be remembered, Salah replied, \"as a moderate man who has common values with everyone... a man who loved his country, who believed so much in it and its potential.\"\n\n\"Jamal was never a dissident. He believed in the monarchy that it is the thing that is keeping the country together. And he believed in the transformation that it is going through.\"\n\nReflecting on their father's career as a journalist, they say Khashoggi was \"like a rock and roll star\" when they were out with him in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"He was a public figure that was liked by everyone else,\" Salah said. \"You don't see that much in media, in print media.\"\n\nAbdullah Khashoggi (left) beside his brother, Salah Khashoggi (right) during an interview with CNN on Sunday.\n\nIf there is a frailty that comes with suddenly losing a parent, Salah and Abdullah, who is two years his junior, don't show it, but Salah's sunken, shadowed eyes show the strain.\n\nSalah, the eldest sibling, has been made the principal family point of contact by the Saudi government, meaning all of Khashoggi's relatives call him. It's a large family and a large emotional burden not eased by the absence of facts. He says he relies on news reports for updates about the investigation into his father's death.\n\n\"Our source is the same source that you have. It is a mystery. This is putting a lot of burden on us -- all of us. That everybody is seeking for information just as we do. They think that we have answers, and unfortunately we don't,\" Salah said.\n\nAbdullah, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, says he was the last of Khashoggi's children to see him alive. When he heard the journalist was going to be in Turkey he went to visit him and spent time with him and his fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. He saw their blossoming relationship and his father's happiness.\n\n\"He was happy. It was a very good opportunity for me to see him. We hung out in Istanbul, we had fun,\" Abdullah said. \"I was really lucky to have last moment with him. I feel very grateful.\"\n\nFollowing the murder, Abdullah was the first family member to visit Khashoggi's apartment in Virginia. There, he said, he found that his father had placed a photograph of his grandchildren, Abdullah's two children and Salah's daughter, by his bed.\n\nAbdullah says he realized how much his father loved his family, placing a photograph where he would see them last thing at night.\n\n\"That shocked me,\" Abdullah said. \"It put an emphasis on his gentle, tender side of loving his family, his grandkids. It's just something huge and it touched me personally and all the family when they knew about it.\"\n\nThe brothers say their father was planning to leave the Washington area and move to Turkey so he could be closer to his children and grandchildren.\n\n\"The main reason behind him choosing to live in Turkey is to be closer to his family. He has a very special relationship with all of his sisters. It's been hard for all of us to hear the tragic news,\" Salah said.\n\nSalah and Abdullah are suffering, but they are not lathered in self-pity. They're speaking publicly now to restore the part of Khashoggi's narrative that belongs to the family. But they say each day is tough, scouring the news for even the smallest detail about their father's murder.\n\n\"It's difficult, it's not easy. Especially when the story gets this big. It's not easy, it's confusing. Even the way we grieve, it's a bit confusing,\" Abdullah said. \"At the same time, we're looking at the media and the misinformation. There's a lot of ups and downs. We're trying to be emotional and at the same time we're trying to get the story -- bits and pieces of the story to complete the whole picture. It's confusing and difficult. It's not a normal situation and not a normal death.\"\n\nSalah, Abdullah and their sisters Noha, 27 and Razan, 25, all want to get on with their lives, they still live and work in the Middle East and have been put under an unenviable spotlight.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pictured shaking hands with Salah Khashoggi.\n\nSalah is due to go back to his banking job in Jeddah very soon, and fears how commentators on social media will react. He says his handshake with the Crown Prince shortly before he left Saudi Arabia two weeks ago was widely misinterpreted.\n\n\"I mean there was nothing, they were just over analyzing the whole situation,\" Salah said. \"I understand why they're trying to do that. They're trying to get as much information as they can out of anything, which is something that we're also doing. Sometimes they're just baseless claims, sometimes they just don't make any sense.\"\n\nSalah says he is waiting for the investigation to be over and for the facts to come out.\n\n\"The King has stressed that everybody involved will be brought to justice. And I have faith in that. This will happen.

But the administration hopes to make progress on both fronts by the end of the year, they said, and have recently stepped up public calls on Saudi Arabia to alleviate the disputes.\n\nCalls for Yemen ceasefire\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo both this week called on participants in the Yemen civil war to agree to a ceasefire \"in the next 30 days,\" a demand that comes amid fresh criticism of US support for the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict.\n\n\"Thirty days from now we want to see everybody around a peace table based on a ceasefire, based on a pullback from the border and then based on ceasing dropping of bombs,\" Mattis said at an event at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nHis call was later echoed by Pompeo, who issued a statement saying, \"the United States calls on all parties to support UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen.\"\n\nMattis and Pompeo both insisted that the US-backed Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthis stop their respective aerial and missile bombardments.\n\nThe three-year conflict between Saudi-led coalition and their Iranian-backed enemies has devastated Yemen and killed at least 10,000 people. United Nations experts say that the coalition's bombing of civilians are potential war crimes and that its partial blockade of the country has put 13 million men, women and children in danger of starvation, in what could become the worst famine in 100 years.\n\nGriffiths said the most pressing factor justifying the US call for a cease-fire was the threat of starvation: \"The threat of famine is a very real threat and risks doubling the numbers of people in Yemen who are at risk of dying of hunger or famine. That's the urgent factor here.\"\n\nGriffiths said he believed the US administration is taking this issue seriously, adding: \"Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo are on this day and night\" but acknowledged \"the challenge now is to turn this call into action.\"\n\nOutrage over the situation has created increasing pressure on the US to pull its support for the coalition, which it provides in the form of military sales, training and refueling of coalition jets.\n\nSaudi Arabia's belated admission that Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and US resident, was murdered by a team with close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has left the Trump administration -- including the President himself -- feeling stung by Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter initial strong denials, the kingdom has produced multiple explanations. Even after admitting that Khashoggi was murdered by men close to bin Salamn, the Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said blaming Saudis for the US resident's death is \"hysterical.\"\n\nSpeaking at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Manama Dialogue in Bahrain Saturday, al-Jubeir said, \"This issue has become fairly hysterical. People have assigned blame on Saudi Arabia with such certainty before the investigation is complete. We have made it very clear that we are going to have a full and very transparent investigation, the results of which will be released.\"\n\nAl-Jubeir met with Mattis on Sunday in Bahrain. The defense secretary told reporters traveling with him on his plane to Prague that he had discussed Khashoggi's death with the Saudi official. \"We discussed it,\" Mattis said, \"you know the same thing we talked about, the need for transparency, full and complete investigation, um, full, full agreement from FM Jubeir, no reservations at all, I said we need to know what happened.\"\n\nTrump and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is the President's son-in-law, placed a heavy reliance on the powerful crown prince for an overall strategy in the region, despite warnings that the young royal was untested and volatile.\n\nWhile American officials previously expressed private displeasure at Mohammed's intervention in the Yemen war and the Saudi-ordered kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, they mostly aired their grievances in private while maintaining in public that the alliance with Saudi Arabia was necessary to counter Iran's influence.\n\nTrump is privately fuming\n\nBut Khashoggi's murder, and the ensuing coverup, have made it more difficult to keep those grievances private.\n\nTrump has privately fumed at the Saudis for putting him in the situation of having to defend his decision to fastidiously cultivate a close relationship with Mohammed and his father, King Salman. He and his advisers are in agreement that forcing some kind of resolution on Yemen is a good way to make the best of a bad situation.\n\nThe Saudi stand-off with Qatar, which has fractured a security alliance importance to the US, has been another thorn in the Trump administration's side.\n\nAsked Wednesday whether he felt betrayed by the Saudis, Trump suggested it was the kingdom's leaders that betrayed themselves.\n\n\"I just hope that it all works out. We have a lot of facts, we have a lot of things that we've been looking at,\" he said. \"They haven't betrayed me. I mean, maybe they betrayed themselves. We'll have to see how it all turns out.\"\n\nTrump has come to the belief in recent days that the American public is starting to catch on to the Yemen catastrophe, including through powerful images of starving children in the New York Times.\n\nThe Trump administration has been criticized by activists and some members of Congress for its support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen and for the administration's recent finding that the coalition was doing enough to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nThe US military provides the Saudi collation with training meant to help minimize civilian casualties, as well as aerial refueling of coalition warplanes.\n\nMattis said the \"goal right now is to achieve a level of capability by those forces fighting against the Houthis, that they are not killing innocent people.\"\n\n\"We refuel probably less than ... I think 20% of their aircraft. They have their own refuelers, by the way,\" Mattis said.\n\nCongressional pressure\n\nA congressional source told CNN the Khashoggi murder has \"put a face\" on the broader problem related to the US-Saudi relationship and renewed momentum on Capitol Hill to push for legislation that would end US involvement in the war in Yemen.\n\nPrevious resolutions aimed at ending US involvement in the war in Yemen have failed to gain approval but various pieces of legislation proposed in recent months have received increasing support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, wrote in a recent op-ed that he plans to bring his resolution to end US involvement in the \"unauthorized war\" in Yemen back to the floor next month.\n\n\"Because of the privileged resolution that will come to a vote sooner or later and that is certainly something that's weighed on the administration,\" a senior congressional aide told CNN. \"I am sure Mattis and Pompeo are well aware of that.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna also cited Pompeo's statement in a press release touting his own bipartisan proposal in the House intended to align with the resolution Sanders is pushing in the Senate.\n\n\"It's about time. After more than three years of war, thousands dead, millions on the brink of starvation, and growing pressure from Congress, the Trump Administration is finally calling for an end to the Saudi-led war in Yemen,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"We have tremendous leverage over the Saudi-led coalition and should demand this Administration do all in their power to bring both sides to the peace table and end the war.\"\n\nThe congressional source also told CNN that efforts to curtail US involvement in Yemen and pressure to respond to Khashoggi's murder are related in that they both provide evidence of the Saudi government's and in particular the crown prince's \"recklessness.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Opinion: Jamal's Khashoggi's legacy should be peace in Yemen", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/NPORokMnYOU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "David Miliband is president of the International Rescue Committee. He is a former British member of Parliament and a former British foreign secretary. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nThe cruel aphorism attributed to former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has too often proved true.\n\nAfter the surprise and welcome -- though belated -- call by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a ceasefire in Yemen, maybe the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi thugs has created a new mantra: one death can be the spark that forestalls the suffering of millions.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible crime rather than an unfortunate tragedy. The feeble excuses from Saudi spokesmen, the changing and contradictory \"lines to take\", all speak to an old truth: the danger that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. No one seems to think that King Salman ordered the killing, so his son, Mohammed bin Salman, needs to explain his role.\n\nThe focus of the international community on this murder, and its demands for accountability, cannot however be limited to this one case. The callous disregard for one life should be an alarm bell about decisions by the same government that are affecting the lives of millions. This is where the ceasefire call by Secretary Pompeo could be so significant.\n\nI recently visited Yemen . It is immediately clear that the world's worst humanitarian crisis is in fact a political crisis.\n\nThe humanitarian suffering is not a natural tragedy but a man-made catastrophe. After nearly four years of war, precipitated by the coup by the Houthis, and thousands of airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition in retaliation, Yemen has been brought to its knees.\n\nThe current Saudi war plan is making things worse. The bombing campaign from the air causes carnage, but cannot shift the Houthi fighters dug in amongst the local population. No one is winning, except Al Qaeda and ISIS, who gain foothold wherever there is chaos.\n\nSo Saudi Arabia's allies in the war effort, led by its closest partners the US and UK, need to deploy their political and military leverage to end the current war strategy. Already, the Saudi-led coalition has intensified its push for Hodeidah in the days since Pompeo's statement in an attempt to change military facts on the ground.\n\nJUST WATCHED Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies 02:52\n\nSecretary Pompeo's ceasefire call needs to be codified immediately in a new UN Security Council resolution. This would stop the increasing violence, would allow humanitarian relief to flow, vital services to be delivered, and the political process essential to a sustainable peace to be driven forward. Britain is the \"pen holder\" on this file at the Security Council and has no excuse for inertia.\n\nMilitary support from the UK and US for the war strategy should stop forthwith to keep this from being a rhetorical exercise. Germany has set an example by cutting off sales, but doesn't have the same influence.\n\nThis move needs to be backed up by other measures. All of Yemen's critical sea ports must be allowed to function at full capacity and Sana'a airport must be opened to critical humanitarian and commercial traffic. Salaries must urgently be paid to the 1.2 million civil servants across the country, including the doctors and nurses, to provide life-saving assistance to the millions in need.\n\nThere needs to be practical measures to make peace sustainable. Treatment of the wounded and prisoner swaps are obvious candidates.\n\nThere is also the tougher question of accountability for war crimes that have been documented by the UN.\n\nAt the Senate's request, the US Administration is reviewing sanctions against those responsible for Khashoggi's death. This is one avenue for the pursuit of justice which should be widened to include violations of international law in Yemen.\n\nPressure on the Saudis and their coalition partners alone is not enough. The Houthis and their backers must also feel the squeeze to come to the table in good faith. As Germany is soon joining the UN Security Council, it can use its credibility and links to good effect.\n\nThe experienced diplomat Martin Griffiths, special envoy of the UN Secretary General, needs substantive, not just rhetorical, backing. There is a landing zone for peace talks, including assurances about an end to missile strikes from the Houthis, backed by Iran, into Saudi Arabia. But the continued fighting is at best delaying his essential peace-making. At worst, it's making peace impossible.\n\nThe suffering in Yemen has gone unacknowledged for far too long - and has emboldened those willing to act with impunity. Jamal Khashoggi's legacy should be accountability not just for the suffering of one, but of millions."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Death toll rises to 23 in California's most destructive fire ever", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/oY3FeoLuO3M/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The death toll in the Camp Fire in Northern California has risen to 23 with the discovery Saturday of 14 more sets of remains, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea told reporters.\n\nHonea said 10 of the victims were recovered from the fire-ravaged town of Paradise.

A \"good portion\" of the business district is gone as well, Jones said.\n\n\"There are places where things are smoldering but, for the most part, the fire is done with Paradise,\" she said.\n\nThe lion's share was lost in Paradise, said John Gaddie, a spokesman for Cal Fire. About 26,000 people live in Paradise, some 85 miles north of Sacramento.\n\nDespite the destruction to both nature and man-made structures, Jones said most of the trees remain.\n\n\"One of the things that's beautiful about Paradise are the trees and they're still here,\" she said. \"I wasn't expecting that, but it's a good thing.\"\n\nCars destroyed by the Camp Fire sit in the lot at a used car dealership on November 9, 2018 in Paradise, California.\n\nA used car lot at Skyway and Birch Street displays a collection of burned-out cars.

It took more than 3 hours to make it through the gridlock.\n\n\"We barely stayed ahead of it,\" Vaughan said. \"And multiple times, as we followed the flow of cars, we thought the fire was going to kill us.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Dad sings to daughter as they flee wildfires", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/MK6kQvSDvXE/joe-allen-dad-daughter-california-wildfire-sot-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said 35 people have been reported missing in the Camp Fire.\n\nThe fast-moving wildfires in the state have destroyed thousands of structures and prompted thousands of residents to flee, sometimes through jam-packed flame-lined streets that forced evacuees to chose whether to try to drive to safety or to get out and run.\n\nThe Camp Fire left the mayor of Paradise, population 26,000, in shock.\n\n\"There's really not much left. There are very few homes still standing and we've been in multiple different neighborhoods this afternoon,\" Mayor Jody Jones said. She estimated only 10 to 20% of homes are left.\n\nFour people were found dead in vehicles that were overcome by flames and one body was discovered near the vehicles, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said. The other victims were found near or inside homes that burned.\n\nTwo major fires in Southern California are just miles from the bar where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, and evacuations were ordered for nearby Malibu, a seaside city popular with celebrities.\n\nAuthorities have received reports of two fatalities in the city of Malibu, and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office said it was working to confirm whether they are related to the wildfires.\n\nFanned by high winds and fueled by low humidity and dry vegetation, the fires spread rapidly Thursday and overnight into Friday. The threat continued Friday, with millions of Californians under \"red flag\" warnings portending windy arid and warm conditions that pose extreme fire risks.\n\nHere's what we know about the trio of fires:\n\nCamp Fire: People flee 'carrying their babies and kids'\n\nIn Northern California, panicked residents began fleeing Paradise on Thursday as the Camp Fire swept through it.\n\nBy Friday morning, the town's main road was littered with downed trees and power lines. Much of the brush and grasses were blackened along the valleys, and many trees were still burning, a CNN crew there observed.\n\nA family that evacuated Thursday by driving along flame-lined roads posted a startling video to Facebook. The recording shows fire claiming houses and trees, and sparks blowing across the road in front of them. Suddenly the vehicle breaks through a wall of smoke and emerges into the safety of a clear road.\n\nJones, the mayor, said a good portion of the business district is gone. And while some trees were torched, Jones said most of them remain.\n\n\"One of the things that's beautiful about Paradise are the trees and they're still here. ... I wasn't expecting that, but it's a good thing,\" Jones said.\n\nAt least 52,000 residents were forced to evacuate from Butte County as the fire burned 90,000 acres.\n\nFlames also were on the outer edges of Chico, a city of 93,000 people about a 90-mile drive north of Sacramento.\n\nThe full extent of the destruction in the county was still unknown, but authorities said more than 6,700 buildings have been destroyed -- many of those in Paradise.\n\nWhitney Vaughan described a scene of panic and terror as she recalled her narrow escape from her Paradise home Thursday morning.\n\nVaughan and her husband had just fled their home as flames rushed them. She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"\n\nThey drove away but got eventually got caught in traffic. Flames were feet away, smoke was thick, cars weren't moving and people were panicking. Some people left their cars there \"and took off running, carrying their babies and kids.\"\n\nShe cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook. She and her husband eventually were able to drive away safely.\n\n\"We thought the fire was going to kill us,\" she told CNN.\n\nParadise, roughly 80 miles north of Sacramento, is where four people were found dead in different vehicles and one person was found dead near a vehicle on the road where Vaughn recorded her video. The other four deceased victims were also found in the Paradise area.\n\nFive people had to be rescued by helicopter from the fire according to Josh Bischof, Riverside Fire Battalion Chief. The rescues were performed by firefighters who were actively engaged in fire-fighting, Bischof said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Scorched hillsides and damaged power lines are seen along the Pacific Coast Highway near Leo Carrillo State Beach in Malibu, California, on Saturday, November 10, after the Woosley Fire tore through the area overnight.

The buildings were seen in movies and television series such as \"Westworld\" and \"The Cisco Kid.\"\n\nThree firefighters and some civilians were injured, Cal Fire officials said. The extent of their injuries was unknown.\n\nMore than 3,200 firefighters were battling the flames and the fire remained just 5% contained, according to Cal Fire. The cause of the fire is still under investigation\n\nThe Camp Fire has destroyed an unknown number of homes and buildings in Paradise.\n\nWoolsey Fire: Thousands of homes evacuated, Malibu area threatened\n\nIn Southern California, strong Santa Ana winds were fanning two fires, including the Woolsey Fire, which by Friday morning had burned across US 101 and was heading toward Malibu.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why wildfires are becoming the new normal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why wildfires are becoming the new normal 02:19\n\nThe Woolsey Fire exploded from 2,000 acres to 8,000 in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in a matter of hours. Friday evening, officials said it had grown to 35,000 acres.\n\nAt least 75,000 homes in Ventura and Los Angeles counties were under evacuation orders, and some structures have already been destroyed, officials said.\n\nThe fire crossed US 101 a few miles east of Thousand Oaks -- the site of Wednesday night's bar shooting -- and was headed south to the Pacific coast, in the direction of Malibu Creek State Park and Malibu city, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.\n\nVIDEO: @LACoFireAirOps Firehawk helicopter flying along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on the way to protect life and property.

I can't think anything matters more -- packing 'items' seems strange. The smoke just seems surreal,\" she wrote.\n\nIn Hidden Hills, just north of Calabasas, Adrienne Janic gave her home over to firefighters late Thursday to use as a command center. Her deck provided a strong vantage point to monitor the spread of the fire.\n\nBy 1 a.m. (4 a.m. ET), more firefighters arrived as the flames closed in on Janic's street\n\n\"While a lot of my yard and neighbors' yards burned, the firefighters saved our homes,\" Janic tweeted just after 2 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) Friday. \"We are still not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nChristy Dawn Little abandoned her Oak Park home, northeast of Thousand Oaks, around 11 p.m. (2 a.m. ET).\n\n\"I had to work this evening, and ran out when I realized how close it was,\" Little told CNN. \"We have found a safe hotel ... (in) Los Angeles.\"\n\nVideo of her drive out of town shows the fire emitting an orange-red glow in the distance in the nighttime sky.\n\nHill Fire: RVs, outbuildings burned\n\nThe Hill Fire is the other fire burning near the site of this week's mass shooting in Thousand Oaks\n\nThe fire started Thursday afternoon and spread quickly to cover about 6,000 acres, fire officials said. Friday, part of it was burning into the footprint of a 2013 wildfire, which could slow its spread, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said. The Hill Fire was 15% contained by Friday evening, at 4,531 acres.\n\nResidents on social media posted their views of the flames nearly consuming the hillside in the Newbury Park area of western Thousand Oaks.\n\nWhile no homes or businesses have been lost to the fast-moving blaze, a number of RVs and outbuildings have been burned and a firefighter suffered a minor injury, authorities said.\n\nHowling Santa Ana winds were driving the Woolsey and Hill fires. The Santa Anas are strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area.\n\nWind gusts of up to 77 mph were reported in Los Angeles County on Friday morning.\n\nA round of Santa Ana winds is forecast to whip the area Sunday through Tuesday, though it may be weaker than Friday's."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Los Angeles Zoo evacuated some animals", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/0n1TA5HDQ0U/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Some animals were evacuated from the Los Angeles Zoo on Friday as a fast-growing brush fire on a nearby hillside threatened the facility.\n\nThe zoo staff evacuated birds used in its \"World of Birds\" show and some of the smaller primate species, the zoo said in a statement posted on its webpage.\n\n\"We turned on our sprinkler systems, and our Ground Maintenance staff began hosing the hillside by hand,\" the statement said. \"It does not appear that the smoke is causing any issues for the animals but on-site staff is monitoring the conditions.\"\n\nSmoke from a wildfire rises over the Los Angeles Zoo on Friday.\n\nThe zoo was closed to the public on Friday.

Here's how it will work.", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/kaDfuqNnfjk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner announced on Saturday that three statewide races in Florida would head to a recount.\n\nWith the margin of unofficial results in the Senate, gubernatorial and agriculture commissioner races below less than half of one percent (0.5%), a machine recount will commence.\n\nBarring lawsuits, delays, and local issues that could lengthen the process, here's a quick breakdown of what to expect over the next week and a half.\n\nMachine recount\n\nCounties can now begin to re-feed ballots into county or central count tabulators for the mandated machine recount. This process must be completed in all 67 counties by 3 p.m. on November 15, when the re-tabulated results are due back to the secretary of state. The results are known as the \"Second Unofficial Returns.\"\n\nManual recount\n\nIf after the machine recount the results from any of these races has a margin of 0.25% or less, a hand recount will be ordered for undervotes and overvotes only - not the entire 8.1 million plus votes that have been cast.\n\nThe Florida Secretary of State's office defines undervotes as \"no choice or fewer than the number of allowable choices in the recounted race(s) on their ballot.\" Essentially, a voter didn't pick someone for every race. The secretary defines overvotes as a voter who \"designated more choices than allowable in recounted race(s) on their ballot\" -- meaning a voter chose more than one candidate in a race.\n\nUndervotes and overvotes are not included in the machine recount and are only checked if the race moves on to the manual recount.\n\nWhat's left?\n\nThere are still more ballots on the way possibly. Overseas military and civilian ballots are due by November 16. All overseas ballots postmarked and signed by Election Day are considered valid.\n\nOnce all returns are in, the county canvassing boards must certify the results and submit them to the secretary of state by noon on November 18.\n\nFollowing the submission from the counties, the Election Canvassing Commission will meet to certify the results on Tuesday, at 9 a.m. on November 20. The commission includes the governor and two of his cabinet members. They will certify the results.\n\nThis is still Florida though, so don't forget another critical deadline on November 30 -- all lawsuits by candidates or civilians are due in circuit court.\n\nAvoiding a recount\n\nDon't hold your breath. Both sides seem to be in for the long haul.\n\nThere are two ways to avoid a recount. First, if a candidate submits a request in writing to not conduct it at any point during the process, the state will no longer be required to finish the re-tabulation.\n\nThere is one other out -- if the number of ballots to be counted (undervotes plus overvotes) is less than the margin between the two candidates, a manual recount is no longer required since it would be mathematically impossible to change the outcome of the election.\n\nAssuming the candidates don't back down and the margins stays close, any of these races could be challenged well into December."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Andrew Gillum withdraws concession as Florida recount begins", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Ozg7Fm2rX_Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Democrat Andrew Gillum withdrew his concession to Republican former Rep.

An attorney for Gillum told reporters the campaign was not alleging any wrongdoing and had no immediate plans to pursue legal action.\n\nExplaining his decision, Gillum said, \"We've learned in various parts of this state that there are still votes that are outstanding.

Rick Scott leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or about .15%. The spread in the governor's race is larger, with Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, for a lead of .41%. In the narrowest contest, Democratic agriculture commissioner candidate Nikki Fried's advantage stands at 5,326 votes \u2014 just .06% \u2014 over Republican Matt Caldwell.\n\nWith the margins in all three contests at under .5%, the votes are now being recounted by machine. That process must be finished by 3 p.m. on Thursday. Races within .25% will then go to a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes. An overvote means a voter selected more than the allotted options on the ballot; an undervote means a vote selected fewer than the available choices or, in these races, none. The Senate race and the contest for agriculture commissioner both currently both fall within .25%.\n\nHours after the recount was formally set in motion, Gillum surprised supporters by withdrawing the concession he offered DeSantis on election night.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call we count every single vote,\" he said at a news conference in Tallahassee. DeSantis in a subsequent video statement said he would continue on with his transition plans and called the initial results \"clear and unambiguous.\"\n\nOn the Senate side, Scott's campaign welcomed the recount by calling on Nelson to opt out of it, which is his option under state law.\n\n\"It's time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of the Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount,\" said Scott spokesman Chris Hartline.\n\nNelson, however, showed no signs of backing down.\n\n\"We believe when every legal ballot is counted, we'll win this election,\" he said in a statement.\n\nDuring a call with reporters later in the day, Marc Elias, his top recount lawyer, predicted that Scott's lead would shrink during the machine recount -- along with the tabulation of overseas and military ballots -- and then \"evaporate entirely\" after the more thorough hand review was completed.\n\nWhile the politicians and lawyers jockeyed to shape the narrative and activists kicked off new protests this weekend, demonstrators pooled on the streets outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office for a second straight day. Again, they targeted Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, chanting \"lock her up\" as she and others worked inside trying to finish the initial vote count before a noon deadline.\n\nThere were also more heated confrontations between protesters -- many in \"Make America Great Again\" hats -- and an increasing number of Democrats, most notably Gillum supporters, before and after the recount was formally called.\n\nScott had escalated already rising tensions across the state on Thursday night, when news conference he took a page from President Donald Trump and, without citing any evidence, accused \"left-wing activists in Broward County\" of trying to steal the election for Nelson. The county, in deep-blue portion of South Florida, is notoriously slow in counting its votes and as its tally mounted, Scott's lead had predictably diminished. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump picked up the thread and accused the Democrats of attempting \"Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\" After the official recount was announced on Saturday, Trump again tweeted, \"Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\"\n\nScott's request for an investigation into election-related fraud did not go far.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement said on Friday it was told by the Department of State, which is run by a Republican Scott-appointee, that they had received \"no allegation of criminal activity.\" On Saturday, the agency's elections division told CNN that two internal observers had \"seen no evidence of criminal activity.\"\n\nStill, Scott's campaign issued an ominous-sounding statement \"encouraging every Florida Sheriff to watch for any violations and take appropriate action.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Nelson campaign is plowing ahead with a lawsuit against the state over its process for validating vote-by-mail ballots. Elias has argued that Florida's signature-matching process put an undue onus on the \"untrained opinions\" of poll workers, which led to a \"complete lack of uniformity\" in how the ballots were being judged.\n\nOn Saturday, Elias told reporters he believed a decision in Nelson's favor could \"add thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted\" to the equation.\n\n\"We have sought a statewide remedy because we believe that all voters -- whether they voted for Sen. Nelson or for Gov. Scott -- should not be disenfranchised because an election worker doesn't believe that their signature in two different places are closely resembling,\" he said.\n\nThere is a court hearing scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has also injected himself into the fight, alleging on Thursday and Friday -- like Scott and the President, with no proof -- that there are \"shenanigans going on in Broward and Palm Beach\" before suggesting that a sinister cabal of liberals from Washington was at work trying to rig the election. In fact, out-of-state lawyers from both parties, including a handful who had significant roles 18 years ago, have been flocking to Florida ahead of the recount.\n\nLeading a call for Scott's campaign on Saturday, Graham touted Scott's legal team and again skewered Broward and Palm Beach election officials for their lack of transparency.\n\n\"Rick has a good team of lawyers,\" Graham said. \"Lawyers are not going to decide this race, the voters will. I support every valid vote being counted. But I also support the rule of law when it comes to voting.\"\n\nAround the state on Friday, allegations and rumors of misplaced or lost votes fueled simmering anger and confusion as the campaigns, lawyers, operatives and freelance rabble-rousers girded themselves for a re-run of the pitched partisan combat that took over the state during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nOutside a mail distribution center in Miami-Dade County, a group of activists with images they said showed undelivered ballots inside tried and failed to get a meeting with a supervisor. Later in the day, a spokeswoman for the US Postal Service said it was \"researching the matter to verify that all ballots have been handled in accordance to USPS service standards.\"\n\nThe Postal Service did not immediately respond to a request for an update on Saturday. Elias confirmed Saturday that Nelson's team was tracking concerns about the facility.\n\nDetailed updates on the state of the race had been hard to come by ahead of Sunday's noon reporting deadline, leading Scott to successfully sue top election officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties for information on the total votes cast and how many of them had been canvassed.\n\nIn Broward, Brenda Snipes turned over information to Scott and his team for review late Friday. But before midnight, the campaign pushed out a new press release claiming Snipes had not fully complied with the court order \"because she refuses to confirm whether or not additional ballots exist that must be counted.\"\n\nAdding to Broward County's troubles, a CNN analysis of votes cast there suggests that ballot design could be responsible for a substantial difference in the number of votes cast between the race for governor and the race for senator in Florida.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Brett Kavanaugh tries to shun the spotlight he can't avoid", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/5RQY1IwA8k4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The last time most Americans saw Brett Kavanaugh , he was on national television testifying before senators , emotional, angry and insistent that Democratic partisans were trying to destroy him with allegations of sexual assault from decades ago.\n\nNow, as President Donald Trump continues to hold up Kavanaugh as a political trophy, the new Supreme Court justice himself is trying to lower his profile.\n\nFor his formal investiture at the Supreme Court on Thursday, he did not appear for any photographs by the news media and skipped a traditional photo op on the marble steps where the public could have seen -- and protested -- him. (The court cited security concerns .)\n\nKavanaugh also seems inclined against a prominent role at next week's annual meeting of the Federalist Society, the group working with the White House to confirm conservative judges, to which Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first appointee, gave a rousing keynote speech last year.\n\nWithin the court, Kavanaugh has deferred to his colleagues in oral arguments and quickly adhered to the court's institutional traditions. The other justices have gone out of their way to be publicly welcoming and have shown an unusual degree of collegiality all around during arguments so far this term, even laughing more at one another's jokes.\n\nIn the few cases he has handled so far, Kavanaugh has declined some opportunities to favor the Trump administration, separating himself from Gorsuch in early votes. He has aligned more with Chief Justice John Roberts than the far right of the bench.\n\nAll told, Kavanaugh appears to be lying low after the volatile confirmation process and buttressing Roberts' efforts to move the court away from the white-hot media spotlight.\n\nYet Kavanaugh, a political insider who spent 12 years on a US appeals court, also understands that the media scrutiny will fade. The record of Kavanaugh, 53 and appointed for life, will become clear only over many months and years.\n\nFor the law in America, the newest of the nine represents only part of a momentous change underway. For years as the justices met privately to decide cases in a rich oak-paneled conference room, the person whose views mattered most was Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded.\n\nA conservative with centrist tendencies on social issues -- including abortion, race and gay rights -- Kennedy was regularly the deciding vote. Like the lawyers who stood at the lectern and publicly argued before the high court, individual justices often tailored their arguments around the private conference table to Kennedy.\n\nNot one of the current nine has a similar centrist approach. Justices on both sides of the ideological divide are watching Kavanaugh for any clues about how to best approach the new justice.\n\nKavanaugh was carefully vetted by a Trump team that did not want a vacillating jurist in the mode of Kennedy.\n\nGorsuch has fulfilled those expectations , often partnering on the far right with Justice Clarence Thomas for an originalist approach to the law, tied to the Constitution's 18th-century origins.\n\nKavanaugh's style is different and he appears to be trying to make good on his oft-repeated confirmation mantra about \"always being a team player on the team of nine.\"\n\nWhere Gorsuch immediately opted against having his clerks join the clerk pool that collectively screens petitions for certiorari, seeking review of cases lost in lower courts, Kavanaugh has had his clerks join. (All justices but Gorsuch and Samuel Alito are in the so-called cert pool, which dates to the 1970s.)\n\nIn the private conference, the junior justice has the responsibility of taking notes on the proceedings and answering the door if any aide knocks to offer a document or even a fetched set of forgotten reading glasses or a coffee cup requested by a justice.\n\nThat person is now Kavanaugh. He will also be last in line to cast his vote. In tight cases, he likely would be the fifth conservative, sealing a victory for the right wing. Or he may prove unpredictable, perhaps even defying his benefactor.\n\nBefore this week's midterm elections, as Trump tried to rally Republicans, he constantly invoked Kavanaugh's appointment and the Democratic opposition he faced. The day after the election, the President boasted that the Kavanaugh strategy paid off.\n\n\"By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings,\" Trump said at a White House news conference.\n\n\"Tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' 05:29\n\nPlaying nice in public\n\nKavanaugh's response to the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford prompted some lawyers and judges, including retired Justice John Paul Stevens, to question his temperament and ability to be an impartial jurist.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, Kavanaugh described Ford's claims as part of \"a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election ... revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\"\n\nIndividual justices are conflicted over how Kavanaugh's confirmation unfolded, yet all have an incentive to be collegial and forward-looking. They have projected a \"business as usual\" image, even appearing to be getting along better on the bench.\n\nKavanaugh has now sat through three weeks of oral arguments. He has held back and let his colleagues air their queries before jumping in. He also has tried to take opportunities to question both sides in fractious cases, perhaps to avoid being labeled with a predictably conservative approach.\n\nFellow justices have shown regard for his questioning, occasionally picking up on his line of inquiry.\n\n\"What the treaty seems to prevent,\" Justice Elena Kagan observed to a lawyer at the lectern in one case, \"is the state from taking either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods.\"\n\nAt another point, Kagan, who sits next to Kavanaugh on the bench, said, \"I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case. ... \"\n\nIn a separate dispute, after Kavanaugh had tried to enter the fray but was interrupted, Roberts stopped the lawyer at the lectern. \"I think Justice Kavanaugh had a question,\" Roberts said, ensuring Kavanaugh an opening.\n\nLater in the same argument, Kavanaugh said, \"to pick up on the chief justice's comments. ... \"\n\nJUST WATCHED Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution 02:02\n\nStaying close to the chief justice\n\nWhile they are united in public, with Kennedy's departure the court is more divided on the substance of the law, split between five conservatives (Roberts, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Clarence Thomas) and four liberals (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan).\n\nYet the chief justice has been determined to show that the court is above politics. Roberts may end up inching to the left himself in some cases, to avoid some 5-4 splits, and may find a new ally in Kavanaugh.\n\nHow those justices on the right band together -- or not -- could make a difference in the cases the court takes up and the fate of long-standing precedents, for example on abortion rights. Where Kavanaugh falls on the ideological spectrum could also affect larger constitutional dilemmas, provoked by Trump's demonstrated disregard for legal norms.\n\nKavanaugh and Roberts, a decade older at 63, have known each other for nearly 30 years. Both served in the US Solicitor General's Office during the George H.W. Bush administration, Roberts as a deputy SG and Kavanaugh on a fellowship for young lawyers. During the George W. Bush administration, Kavanaugh obtained top legal jobs and Roberts won court appointments, first to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 2003, and then to the Supreme Court, in 2005.\n\nKavanaugh himself then served on the DC Circuit, reinforcing their common path. They have long had a friendly relationship.\n\nLast month, when Kavanaugh underwent a ceremonial investiture at the White House, following his 50-48 confirmation vote by the Senate, he went out of his way to praise Roberts.\n\n\"Chief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary,\" Kavanaugh said. \"As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States.\"\n\nRoberts returned the favorable comments when he spoke of judicial independence, after referring to \"the contentious events in Washington,\" at the University of Minnesota the following week.\n\n\"As our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation,\" Roberts said.\n\nNot siding with Trump -- yet\n\nThe 2018-19 session, which began a week before Kavanaugh was seated last month, is still so new that he and most justices have yet to issue any written opinions. But Kavanaugh has taken actions that separate him from the conservative stalwarts.\n\nIn late October, when the court took up a challenge to the Commerce Department's addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, Kavanaugh was with the majority in allowing lower court proceedings to continue and testimony to be taken from a key Justice Department lawyer in the dispute, while his fellow conservatives Gorsuch and Thomas dissented. (Separately, the full court blocked the challengers from obtaining testimony from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.)\n\nA week later, on November 2, the court by a 6-3 vote rejected a subsequent administration request to postpone the trial . Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch publicly dissented, but Kavanaugh, who may have been predicted to join them, did not.\n\nThat same day, the Supreme Court -- again over public dissents from Thomas and Gorsuch -- rejected a Trump administration request to block a lawsuit by youths who want to hold the government responsible for emissions policy and climate change.\n\nIn none of those three matters did Kavanaugh write anything that became public.\n\nTrump had no public comment on any of them, either. The President still speaks enthusiastically of his new nominee and suggests he believes the high court will be more on his side.\n\nWhen a federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a decision that blocked the administration from ending an Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the United States when young from deportation, Trump said he would be happy to take the case to the nine.\n\n\"We want to be in the Supreme Court on DACA,\" Trump told reporters Friday morning, later adding, \"where we'll be given a fair decision.\"\n\nAnd earlier in the week, before Tuesday's elections, the President raised Kavanaugh's name to rally campaign crowds. He cast Kavanaugh as a victim of false accusers and their Democratic enablers.\n\n\"False accusations. False accusations,\" Trump said. \"They want to ruin a man or a woman. Ruin a man.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Whitaker's controversial prosecution of a gay Democrat", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/f0jcJXeW8Sc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) When Iowa state Sen.

Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "FDA plans to launch new restrictions on e-cigarette flavors", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sautk1x1bCQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Taking on epidemic levels of teen e-cigarette use, the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce new restrictions on the sale of e-cigarette products an agency official confirmed Thursday.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations as early as next week.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017.

The medical association has long maintained that firearm-related deaths and injuries should be treated as an urgent public health crisis.\n\nThe recommendations include urging doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety.\n\nThe argument also comes at a time when organizations like Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic , known as SAFE, are coming together to demand an increase in federal funding for gun violence research while calling on lawmakers to implement \"evidence-based policy\" on guns.\n\nA spokeswoman for the NRA dismissed the flood of comments.\n\n\"The so-called 'uproar' on twitter or what could [be] characterized as a normal exchange of emotions and uninformed opinions has nothing to do with the substance of the article being promoted in the tweet.

The gun control policies they advocate for are already the law in California and they did not prevent [last night's] tragedy.\"\n\nBaker added that the focus on the NRA is misguided.\n\nIf medical organizations \"would like to concentrate on a public health crisis,\" she wrote, \"they should focus on the mental health crisis that results in nearly 50,000 suicides per year, the medical community's complicity in the opioid crisis that takes over 42,000 lives per year or the 250,000 deaths due to medical errors.\"\n\nFew NRA supporters appeared to get into the Twitter mix with the doctors, nurses and others.\n\nBut some stepped onto the field, like @wickedgrin1, who said, \"This is a crime issue, not a public health issue.

It's a higher rate for the 50 largest metropolitan areas combined, with 4.9 people per 100,000 killed by a gun. This is an increase from 2012-13, when the national rate was 3.7 per 100,000 nationwide and 4.1 per 100,000 for major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe rates vary widely by city. For example, there's a higher chance of being killed by a gun in New Orleans than in the Providence, Rhode Island, area. About 1 in 100,000 residents was killed by a gun in Providence and Warwick combined, compared with 16.6 per 100,000 residents in New Orleans.\n\nNationally, homicide was the 16th-leading cause of death, the new report notes. Guns were used in 74% of those deaths. For children between the ages of 10 and 19, guns were used in even more homicides: 87%.\n\nMen and boys were most often the victims of homicides, accounting for 85% of the firearm deaths.\n\nFor suicides, there is also a great variety between cities. Oklahoma City, for instance, saw 13.5 suicides by gun per 100,000 residents, compared with New York, Newark and Jersey City, which combined for a rate of 1.5 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of people older than 10 who are using a gun to kill themselves has increased, too. Researchers don't use statistics from gun deaths for children under 10, because those self-inflicted deaths are probably accidentals, according to the report.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for everyone over 10, with guns used in half of all those deaths. It's the second-leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 19, with guns used in 42% of those cases.\n\nThough the gun suicide rate for young people is notably lower than for other age groups, the report finds that those numbers are increasing.\n\n\"I rarely take care of a suicide attempt with a gun in the emergency room. The kinetic energy of a bullet is far more effective than taking pills that have a longer duration and more opportunity for intervention,\" said Dr. Stephen Hargarten , director of the Comprehensive Injury Center, associate dean of the Office of Global Health and a professor of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nHargarten, who was not involved in the new report, said many groups are working to reduce firearm-related suicides, but it remains \"such a challenging area.\"\n\nThe latest increase in gun-related deaths is similar to the rates seen in the 2006-07 time period, the report said. The US has the world's highest rate of gun ownership by civilians, according to research, and the highest rate of gun-related deaths among industrialized countries.\n\nThe authors of the new report note that it is \"too soon to know\" whether this recent increase in gun deaths represents a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.\n\nHargarten said he hopes the US government will see an increase in gun deaths in the proper frame, \"as a complex biological and sociological disease,\" and increase funding for research. Gun violence is the least-studied of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, a 2017 study found\n\nHargarten said he has seen cities, states and even major medical groups starting to spend more money on this kind of research, but he -- like many others who do research on gun violence -- feels that the federal government needs to \"step it up\" to figure out what is causing this problem.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Where is the federal government in all of this? When there are so many deaths, we need to invest in this issue now,\" Hargarten said. \"Look what we did with HIV and AIDS when it was breaking out in the '80s and '90s. The federal government addressed it, and the complexity and the political issues, and it helped groups most at risk, by investing our resources appropriately, and it made a huge difference in that disease process. It's imperative that we do that for guns.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Remembrance Day: Procession of 10,000 to pay their respects", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46168197", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Members of the armed forces remove their hats before cheering the Queen\n\nA procession of 10,000 people to the Cenotaph in central London will give \"a nation's thank you\" to those who laid down their lives in World War One.\n\nMembers of the public chosen by ballot will pay their respects at the memorial while the Prince of Wales will lay a wreath on behalf of the Queen.\n\nIt marks 100 years since Armistice Day, when WW1 officially ended on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.\n\nA series of a special events across the country are honouring those who died.\n\nThe day's events started at 06:00 with pipers across Britain playing the Scottish lament \"Battle's O'er\".

Then when I got to university I began to faint frequently, my hair was falling out, I had severe joint pains and was constantly tired. My Mum thought it was down to my hectic student lifestyle.\"\n\nA visit to her GP and two blood tests for iron levels revealed that she was suffering from genetic haemochromatosis or GH - a genetic condition which causes iron to overload in the body.\n\nMost of us think of iron as a strength-giver and worry more about iron deficiency. There is little awareness of the risks of iron overload, and confusingly some of the symptoms, like fatigue, can be the same.\n\nSays Katherine: \"I was very lucky to get a quick diagnosis. A lot of health professionals believe women do not show symptoms until much later in life, which can then lead to potential organ damage.\n\n\"In the last year, I have had about 30 hospital and health visits. Today I suffer from chronic fatigue, IBS, and joint pains in my knees, hands and elbows. The only treatment for this is venesection, where I have a pint of blood removed every few months.\n\n\"I do feel lucky that I was diagnosed young as it allows me to monitor my health. Some days I am in excruciating pain, other days I am fine. But there needs to be more awareness of this condition.\"\n\nWhat is genetic haemochromatosis?\n\nGH is a condition which leads to the accumulation of iron in the organs of the body\n\nIn the UK, it is thought that approximately 250,000 people are at risk of GH, although many are undiagnosed, and the risk is higher for men than women\n\nIt is caused by a faulty gene - Northern Europeans with Celtic origins, particularly of Irish backgrounds, are more likely to carry the gene\n\nSymptoms of GH include fatigue, joint disease, skin problems, and sexual health issues. Left untreated GH can cause serious illness such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.\n\nTreatment is relatively simple and consists of venesection (bloodletting). As the body makes more blood to replace that taken, it uses up the excess stored iron.\n\nSource: Haemochromatosis UK\n\n'The most common condition you've never heard of'\n\nA recent report by the charity Haemochromatosis UK (HUK) surveyed 2,000 people with the condition worldwide.\n\nIt found that 73% of patients suffered with psychological difficulties, 81% experienced fatigue and 87% experienced arthritis or joint pain.\n\nAlthough most were satisfied with their treatment by specialists, about a third highlighted that information and support from GPs was poor.\n\nThe report was launched at the House of Commons, where MPs, campaigners and patients gathered to help raise awareness of the condition.\n\nDr Edward Fitzsimons, consultant haematologist, University of Glasgow, said: \"Haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic disorders found in North European populations.\n\n\"Yet it is a condition that all too easily escapes diagnosis.\n\n\"For every one patient diagnosed, there are some eight to 10 who are undiagnosed.\n\n\"It is without doubt the most common condition you have never heard of.\"\n\n'I felt like an old aching lady instead of a young teen'\n\nImage copyright Abigail Harvey Image caption Abigail Harvey, 19, is having treatment for haemochromatosis\n\nAbigail Harvey, 19, was diagnosed with haemochromatosis at just 15.\n\nUp to that point she had suffered from severe period pain cramps and joint pain as well as depression.

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"At a global level there is no migration solution,\" Prof Murray says.\n\nBut while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "NHS outpatients service 'stuck in the 18th Century'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46142276", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:47", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 127 millon outpatient appointments every year\n\nThe way hospitals in the UK run outpatient clinic appointments is stuck \"in the 18th Century\", leading doctors say.\n\nEvery year millions of people travel to hospitals, where doctors check up on their health and discuss their care.\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians said many appointments were unnecessary - and outdated, inefficient systems meant large numbers were missed or cancelled.\n\nIt said the situation was frustrating for patients, and wasting money.\n\nThe RCP's report said the time had come to overhaul the system by embracing innovation: making more use of remote monitoring and telephone and video consultations.\n\nGetting other staff, such as senior nurses, to run clinics closer to people's homes could also help.\n\nIt said a number of places had already started taking these steps, but much more needed to be done.\n\nDr Toby Hillman, of the RCP, said: \"It's an 18th Century system.

While they remain threatened they have done well in places such as Cantabria in northern Spain where their numbers have almost doubled in ten years.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wolf sightings have increased in Germany and France in recent years\n\nBut conservation success is also increasing the chances of human-wildlife conflict.\n\nWolf numbers have increased in Germany to such an extent that the animals now roam into the Netherlands where they have been linked to an increase in attacks on sheep.\n\nDespite these wild carnivores being protected by law in most countries, that hasn't stopped farmers reaching for their guns when their domestic animals have been attacked.\n\nThis has become a significant issue in some countries. In France, around 10,000 sheep were killed in wolf attacks in 2016, with the government paying out some \u20ac3.2m in compensation.\n\nNow the EU hopes that by relaxing the rules on reimbursing farmers for the damage done by carnivores, it will lessen the need for farmers to kill these threatened species.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, member states will be able to fully compensate farmers for damages caused by wolves and bears. The farmers will also be entitled to compensation for building electric fences and buying guard dogs.\n\nIndirect expenses, including veterinary bills for the treatment of wounded sheep or cattle, and the costs of searching for missing animals, will also be fully met.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners welcomed the move.\n\n\"It's taking away an excuse for killing the animals by saying there are preventative measures you can take which can reduce, if not completely eliminate the threat,\" said Dr Jo Swabe from Humane Society International.\n\n\"We hope it will make a difference on the ground.\"\n\nImage copyright NurPhoto Image caption French farmers have held protests against plans to allow wolf numbers to increase\n\nThere has been a lot of pressure from governments in Germany and France to allow culls of wolves as a way of protecting domestic livestock. And some have raised concerns that humans could also be attacked.\n\n\"You have essentially scaremongering politicians saying we need to have this option because sometimes it could be a child that's attacked,\" said Dr Swabe.\n\n\"But if you look at wolf behaviour, it's highly unlikely that a child would ever be attacked. They have more to fear from us than we have from them.\"\n\nWhile the EU has sanctioned increased payments for farmers in the hope that this might reduce the need for culling, the money has not always been forthcoming from governments. Experts say that in Romania, for example, payments for damage caused by large carnivore attacks have been withheld.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "ExoMars: Life-detecting robot to be sent to Oxia Planum", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153332", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption ExoMars: A copy of the rover undergoing testing\n\nThe robot rover that Europe and Russia will send to Mars in 2020 will be targeted at a near-equatorial site on the Red Planet known as Oxia Planum.\n\nThe area was recommended by an expert panel meeting at Leicester University.\n\nOxia is rich in clays and other minerals that have resulted from prolonged rock interactions with water.\n\nThe ExoMars vehicle will carry a drill and sophisticated instruments to this ancient terrain to look for signs of past or even present life.\n\nTechnically, Oxia remains just a recommendation at this stage; it still needs to be signed off by the heads of the European and Russian space agencies.\n\nBut it is hard to see the considered view of the Landing Site Selection Working Group (LSSWG) being overturned.\n\nImage copyright IRSPS/TAS; NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State Universi Image caption Oxia Planum: The landing possibilities have been studied for more than four years\n\nThe two-day gathering in Leicester was informed by specialists in Mars geology, and engineers whose chief concern was identifying a location that minimised the risks of landing.\n\nGetting down safely to the surface of the Red Planet is notoriously difficult. More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Antarctic: Nasa shares close-up photos of big PIG iceberg", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153327", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA ICEBRIDGE/Brooke Medley Image caption Icebergs calve from the front of glaciers that terminate in the sea\n\nScientists this week got their first close-up look at the big new iceberg that's calved from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Antarctic.\n\nThe block, which has the designation B-46, initially covered 225 sq km.\n\nGiven the fashion in recent years to compare such bergs with the area of Manhattan Island, that would have made this one roughly three times the size of the famous district in New York.\n\nBut the Nasa over-flight on Wednesday shows the berg is already breaking up.\n\nThe US space agency DC-8 was on a routine expedition as part of the IceBridge project, which measures the elevation of ice surfaces with a laser.\n\nResearchers onboard were able to point their cameras out the windows of the aircraft and capture some of the scale and beauty of the frozen scene below.\n\nThe PIG drains a vast area of west Antarctica that is roughly equivalent to two-thirds the area of the UK.

And, as many of their inhabitants were now immigrants, that also meant racial segregation.\n\nThe urban society of the 19th century, built upon a melting pot, was now gone.\n\nIn public consciousness, the issues facing the residents of these neighbourhoods - high unemployment rates and segregation from the cities beyond the estates' boundaries - were buried beneath concerns about integration and assimilation.\n\nIn public discourse, it was not that the residents of France's grands ensembles faced problems, it was that they were the problem.\n\nThese once \"functional cities\" were suddenly at the heart of France's immigration debate - the concrete onto which its fears and prejudices were projected - and that is where they have remained, misrepresented and neglected with their original ideals long since forgotten.\n\nThis is Europe: Can residents of one French housing estate change the negative stereotypes of their community?\n\nSource: Al Jazeera"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Inside Libyan detention 'hell' where refugee burned himself alive", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/libyan-detention-hell-refugee-burned-alive-181110102329706.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "It's been nearly three weeks since Abdulaziz, a 28-year-old Somali, doused himself in petrol before burning himself to death in Triq al Sikka migrant detention centre in Libyan capital, Tripoli.\n\nOther detainees, who witnessed what happened, said he killed himself shortly after a visit from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), claiming officials had told him he had no chance of being evacuated from Libya.\n\nAbdulaziz had been in the detention centre for nine months, and felt completely hopeless, they said.\n\n\"First he started in secret, then he was shouting, people were running, then it was already over,\" said one detainee about the suicide, adding that others tried to save him, but it was too late.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThe UNHCR says the Somali's death had nothing to do with their visit, and Abdulaziz was scheduled for evacuation to Niger next month, though it's not clear why he hadn't been told about it.\n\nIn the following days, refugees collected small amounts of money, sent from their families, to buy coffee, biscuits, and candles, and celebrate his life.\n\nHowever, their thoughts quickly turned to who might die next.\n\nThousands of refugees and migrants are currently being held in indefinite detention by Libya's Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM). Many were deported back to Libya after the boats they were on, en route to Italy, were intercepted by the EU-funded Libyan coastguard.\n\nAmong them are people from Somalia, Eritrea, or Sudan; countries at war or dictatorships where gross human rights abuses are taking place.\n\nThey say they can't go home, and should be evacuated to a safe country.\n\nOf the centres in Libya's capital, Tripoli, Triq al Sikka, which holds more than 400 people, is regularly described by refugees and migrants as one of the worst, because of the levels of neglect and abuse.\n\n\"It's just like hell,\" one former detainee said. \"An abomination.\"\n\n'Day and night is the same for us'\n\nAl Jazeera has spoken to six current and former detainees in Triq al Sikka. Some say they've stayed as long as a year, while others escaped during recent clashes in the city. Calls to DCIM went unanswered.\n\nDetainees described spending every day in the dark, with guards who won't go near them, for fear of contracting disease. \"Day and night is the same for us,\" one man said.\n\nIn the past few months, the situation has reached a crisis point. For three weeks, detainees say those infected with tuberculosis have been given no medication, after staff from the International Rescue Committee (IRC), which has provided medical care there since early September, became worried they were contracting the disease.\n\nNow, they fear every male has it. One detainee described a man coughing blood beside him. \"May God help him. Yesterday they took him to the front door but the guards said there is no doctor. So the number (of sick people) could increase, unless there is a solution. We are living by the power of God.\"\n\nThomas Garofalo, IRC Libya country director, said staff were \"overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"We had been working with the National Centre for Disease Control to document and diagnose cases of TB, and we are trying to do that but the conditions in the centre are just not adequate, that's the problem.\"\n\nHe said IRC has diagnosed 25 cases of TB in Sikka, and those who were deemed contagious were removed and isolated, but this process was suspended last week after staff tested positive for TB. They're aware the disease may now be spreading.\n\n\"The problem is not unmanageable, but Libya can't or won't handle it, and we need other countries, on a humanitarian basis, to provide help and provide asylum if needed, or at least to work with the Libyan authorities so that we can have more humane treatment of these people.\"\n\nThe layout of the centre means more than 200 men and older teenage boys are all crammed into one dark hall, with almost 230 women and children in another, more open, area. Sick people are kept with everyone else.\n\nDetainees are mainly Eritreans and Somalis, thought there are also Ethiopians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Syrians and South Sudanese, they say.\n\nAmong them are roughly 30 married couples. Husbands and wives can meet and speak for about ten minutes a week, according to detainees. \"At that moment, the guards (stand) about one metre from you,\" one commented. \"You get afraid to touch each other because they don't love. The police don't like it.\"\n\nAbdulaziz, the Somali man who killed himself, was married, and his wife remains in the centre. There are also children there, including newborn babies.\n\nOthers locked up are pining lost loves; one man told Al Jazeera of his girlfriend who died in the Sahara desert on the way to Libya.\n\nDetainees said that, as well as TB, people regularly suffer from fevers, kidney problems, and various other diseases.\n\nSome are disabled from injuries received earlier on the migration route.\n\n\"If I spend time more here it means I am waiting to die, because the situation is very bad,\" one man said.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nCurrent and former detainees say there have been anywhere between seven to twenty deaths in Triq al Sikka this year. Al Jazeera was unable to confirm these deaths with any organisation working there.\n\n\"When they die, (the guards) just take the body and that's it,\" said one man, adding if migrants didn't hold their own remembrances or try to inform families, \"no one would do anything\".\n\nAs evidence of the tight hold on information coming from the centre, phones are strictly forbidden. Three former detainees said they'd never ask guards to contact the family of someone who died, for fear of being brought to a small room and beaten with metals or sticks, or deprived of food.\n\nWhen foreign visitors come to Sikka, detainees said injured or tortured people are hidden at the back of the hall, put sitting between buses, or locked in the guards' toilets. Three former detainees said that UN staff always call before they arrive, and guards warn detainees \"if you say something negative about us we will torture you\".\n\nA foreign journalist who visited Triq al Sikka last year confirmed he witnessed beatings there, and that it \"seemed to be a punishment\".\n\n\"Libyan guards do not care about these people at all. That was clear to me across every place I visited. They really did seem to consider these people like animals,\" he said.\n\nIn late August, heavy fighting broke out in Tripoli, as rival militias vied for control of the capital. During the clashes, a missile fell close to Sikka, and in the chaos some detainees escaped. But others, including those with wives and children, thought it was better to stay where they were rather than risk being on the streets, where they could be killed or kidnapped.\n\nThough a ceasefire was reached, detainees say they still hear occasional fighting. \"Everyone has guns and all the time we're hearing the sounds of guns,\" one man said.\n\nDuring the fighting, medical teams tracking TB cases lost track of some of those infected, according to IRC's Garofalo. The sounds of warfare also added to the trauma suffered by people who have already been through torture by smugglers, extortion and abuse along the route to Libya and the disappointment of being returned from the Mediterranean after they tried to escape.\n\nTrauma means some detainees have begun to talk to themselves, sleep in the toilet, get angry, or \"play with dirty things,\" one detainee told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"You know prison is very sensitive for the mind. When you stay a long time without anything in prison you have to become crazy or die. This prison is very, very hard for human beings.\"\n\nWhen asked what was the worst thing they saw in Sikka, former detainees were unanimous. They said it was when guards sell detainees to smugglers.\n\n\"These Libyans only think of you as an industry,\" one said.\n\nAccused of working with smugglers\n\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International, have previously accused the Libyan authorities of working with smugglers.\n\nOther detainees say they feel their only hope is to return to illegal routes, though figures from September show only one in ten migrants who attempt to cross the Mediterranean from Libya are making it to Europe.\n\n\"I don't have hope to evacuate by UNHCR,\" an Eritrean said. \"I only know that I will pay money and try again to the sea.\"\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nAll detainees Al Jazeera spoke to said they realise that spending all day in cramped quarters, with little nutrition and poor sanitation, may have health implications that could stay with them for life.\n\nOne man said he feels his face and body now look ten years older than his actual age, because of all he's been through.\n\n\"This prison gets very dirty inside, there's no place to walk, so for 24 hours we are sitting,\" he said.\n\n\"Because of the shortage of food, clean water, no medication and not enough sleeping space, it's very dirty with a bad smell. We stayed a long time without fresh air, sunlight and no communication with our families and others,\" he added.\n\n\"I miss outside so much.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Mosul residents left to rebuild destroyed homes", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/mosul-residents-left-rebuild-destroyed-homes-181108130803158.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Mosul, Iraq - During the nine-month battle to retake Iraq's Mosul from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) fighters, 54,000 houses were destroyed in and around the city.\n\nSince July last year, when victory was declared in Mosul, the city has witnessed numerous reconstruction projects run by government organisations and NGOs.\n\nThe vast majority of these projects are taking place in the old city of Mosul, focussing mostly on cleaning the streets, helping rebuild schools and basic infrastructures, such as water supply and electricity network.\n\nA fund of $400m was established in 2015 to help Iraq's reconstruction.\n\nHowever, the city received only $252,000 in 2017 and in 2018, the Governor of Nineveh Governorate, Nofal Hammadi, claimed to have received nothing from the fund, Mosul's municipality chief Abdelsattar al-Hibbu told Reuters news agency earlier this year.\n\nFurthermore, Hammadi told Al Jazeera last month that no budget was allocated to rebuild private housing in Mosul.\n\nIn the overwhelming majority of cases, civilians whose homes have been flattened are indeed forced to fend off for themselves.\n\nAhmed Al Ebadi, a west Mosul resident, requested financial compensation from the court earlier this year.\n\n\"I received nothing for the damage caused by the Iraqi army,\" said Ebadi.\n\nPrior to ISIL, Mosul's predominantly Sunni population felt marginalised by Baghdad's central government for years.\n\nNow, many are forced into debt as they have to borrow money to rebuild their houses.\n\n\"I am a poor man, I can't afford to pay $25,000 to rebuild my house,\" said Mohammed Hazim Abbas, a resident of west Mosul.\n\nFor many Mosulians, a house is seen as a first step towards rebuilding their family life, which too got devastated by the war against ISIL."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Big studies give long-awaited answers on who does and does not benefit from these popular nutrients.\n\nFish oil taken by healthy people, at a dose found in many supplements, showed no clear ability to lower heart or cancer risks. Same for vitamin D.\n\nBut higher amounts of a purified, prescription fish oil slashed heart problems and heart-related deaths among people with high triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, and other risks for heart disease. Doctors cheered the results and said they could suggest a new treatment option for hundreds of thousands of patients like these.\n\nUp to 10 percent of U.S. adults take fish oil. Even more take vitamin D, despite no major studies to support the many health claims made for it.\n\n\"Those who peddle it promote it as good for everything,'' but in this definitive test, vitamin D \"showed a big nothing,'' said Dr. James Stein, a heart specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He had no role in the studies or ties to the companies involved.\n\nResults were revealed Saturday at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAbout fish oil\n\nThese oils, also called omega-3 fatty acids, are found in salmon, tuna and certain other fish. They reduce triglycerides and inflammation and may have other effects. There are different types, including EPA and DHA.\n\nOne study tested 4 grams a day of Amarin Corp.'s prescription Vascepa, which is concentrated EPA, in more than 8,000 patients with high triglycerides and a greater risk of heart problems for various reasons. All were already taking a statin such as Lipitor or Zocor to lower cholesterol. Half were given Vascepa and the rest, mineral oil capsules as a comparison.\n\nAfter five years, about 17 percent of those on Vascepa had suffered one of these problems -- a heart attack, stroke, heart-related death or clogged arteries requiring medical care -- versus 22 percent of the others.\n\nThat worked out to a 25 percent reduction in risk. Looked at individually, heart attacks, heart-related deaths and strokes all were lower with Vascepa. Only 21 people would need to take Vascepa for five years to prevent one of the main problems studied -- favorable odds, Stein said.\n\nSide effects may be a concern: More people on Vascepa were hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat -- 3 percent versus 2 percent of the comparison group. Doctors say that's puzzling because other research suggests fish oil lowers that risk.\n\nThe concern with the heart rhythm problem is that it can raise the risk of stroke, but there were fewer strokes among those on Vascepa, said study leader Dr. Deepak Bhatt of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nVascepa costs around $280 a month; many insurers cover it. Amarin sponsored the study and some study leaders work or consult for the company.\n\nThe other study tested a lower 1 gram daily dose of a different type of fish oil -- an EPA/DHA combo sold as Lovaza or Omacor and in generic form -- in 26,000 people with no prior heart problems or cancer.\n\nAfter about five years, rates of a combined measure of heart attacks, strokes and other problems were similar for fish oil users and a comparison group. Cancer rates and deaths also were similar.\n\nThere were fewer heart attacks in the fish oil group -- 145 versus 200 in the comparison group. The study leader, Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's, called that \"a substantial benefit,'' but several independent experts disagreed because of the way the study was set up to track this and certain other results.\n\n\"These findings are speculative and would need to be confirmed in a separate trial,'' said the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen.\n\nFishy comparisons?\n\nBoth studies share a problem: the oils used for the comparison groups, which may not have been true placebos. The Vascepa study used mineral oil, which interferes with statin drugs, raises cholesterol, and might have made the comparison group fare worse and made Vascepa look better than it truly was.\n\nThe other study used olive oil, which might have helped that comparison group do better, possibly masking any benefit to the others from fish oil.\n\nLeaders of both studies say any effect from the comparison oils isn't enough to alter the main results, and independent experts agreed. But Nissen, who is leading another fish oil study, is using corn oil as a comparison.\n\nThe 'sunshine' vitamin\n\nManson's study also tested vitamin D, which the skin makes from sun exposure. It's tough to get enough from foods like milk, eggs and oily fish, though many foods now are fortified with it. Some studies have found that people with lower levels of D are more likely to develop cancer, but it's not known if supplements alter that risk.\n\nStudy participants took 2,000 international units of D-3 (the most active form of vitamin D, also called cholecalciferol) or fake vitamin pills for five years.\n\nVitamin D did not affect the odds of having a heart attack or stroke or developing cancer. After excluding the first two years of use, researchers saw fewer cancer deaths among those on the vitamin -- 112 versus 149 in the placebo group.\n\n\"Cancer can take years to develop'' so a difference may not show up right away, Manson said. \"This looks promising'' and people will be studied longer to see if the trend holds up, she said.\n\nSeveral other experts said these numbers just hint at a possible benefit that needs more study.\n\n\"These 'positive' results need to be interpreted with caution,'' Dr. Clifford Rosen of Maine Medical Center Research Institute and Dr. John Keaney Jr. of the University of Massachusetts wrote in a commentary in the medical journal."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda Readies to Stave Off Ebola Along DRC Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-ebola-drc-border/4653039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "In Uganda, officials have stepped up measures to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

The other, the control group, was restricted to 10 minutes per day on each of the three platforms: Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nThe restrictions were put in place for three weeks and then the participants returned and were tested for outcomes such as fear of missing out (FOMO), anxiety, depression and loneliness.\n\n\u200bResults of study\n\nThe results showed a very clear link between social media use and increased levels of depression and loneliness.\n\n\u201cUsing less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThese effects are particularly pronounced for folks who were more depressed when they came into the study.\u201d\n\nShe calls her findings the \u201cgrand irony\u201d of social media.\n\nWhat is it about social media that\u2019s just so depressing?\n\nHunt says that it\u2019s two major things. The first is that social media invites what Hunt calls \u201cdownward social comparison.\u201d When you\u2019re online, it can sometimes seem that \u201ceveryone else is cooler and having more fun and included in more things and you\u2019re left out,\u201d she said. And that\u2019s just generally demoralizing.\n\nThe second factor is a bit more nuanced.\n\n\u201cTime is a zero-sum game,\u201d Hunt told VOA. \u201cEvery minute you spend online is a minute you are not doing your work or not meeting a friend for dinner or having a deep conversation with your roommate.\u201d\n\nAnd these real life activities are the ones that can bolster self-esteem and self worth, Hunt said.\n\nWhat to learn\n\nSo what\u2019s the takeaway?\n\nPeople are on their devices, and that\u2019s not going to change, she said. But as in life, a bit of moderation goes a long way.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life,\u201d she added.\n\nHunt pointed out a few caveats to the study. First, it was done exclusively with 18- to 22-year-olds, and it is unclear if the depressing effects of social media will cross generational lines to older or younger people, Hunt said. But she expects her results should generalize at least for people through the age of 30.\n\nHunt says she is now beginning a study to gauge the emotional impact of dating apps."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "For Autistic Kids, Robots Can Be Social, Learning Study Buddy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/for-autistic-kids-robots-can-be-social-skills-learning-study-buddy/4652742.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Robots have been put to work assembling cars in factories, answering questions at conventions and hotel lobbies, moving packages in warehouses, and more.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

Perpetrators historically rarely faced more than a fine, experts say, but can now be sentenced to up to five years in prison thanks to a law that took effect in September.\n\nThe Sexual Harassment Law was passed earlier this year amid an uproar over the arrest and swift release of a man who ejaculated on a fellow bus passenger. The crime was considered a misdemeanor.\n\nThis classification gave perpetrators a sense of impunity and showed a lack of regard for violence against women, said Silvia Chakian, a S\u00e3o Paulo prosecutor who focuses on crimes against women.\n\n\u201cThese cases used to be left in a legislative gap,\u201d Chakian said. \u201cIt was difficult to find a legal framing between \u2018insult to decency,\u2019 which is a misdemeanor with an insignificant penalty, and the crime of rape, which is a more serious crime with prison terms of six to 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe new law defines sexual harassment as a lewd act against someone without their consent that is committed by someone \u201cto satisfy their own lust or that of a third person.\u201d It carries a penalty of one to five years in prison.\n\nBetween Sept. 25, when the law took effect, and Oct. 23, 36 incidents of sexual harassment were reported on buses, trains and subways in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area alone, according to a HuffPost Brazil analysis of transit authority data.\n\nDespite the problem\u2019s persistence, the law is widely seen as a crucial step toward curbing harassment of women in public spaces.\n\nReporting Harassment\n\nThe first arrest for sexual harassment on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s public transit system was made the day after the law took effect.\n\nA woman reported that a man sat next to her on a train and ran his hand over her legs. She got off the train at the next station and reported the incident to security officials, who found the suspect and brought him to police. After an initial hearing, the man was released pending the outcome of his trial, but he is required to check in with authorities each month until the case goes to court, according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State Court of Justice.\n\nThe incident was one of 13 cases of sexual harassment reported between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23 on S\u00e3o Paulo trains, according to transit authority data. Six other cases were reported on metro area buses. Seventeen incidents were reported on the city\u2019s subways, and subway officials say 13 of those resulted in arrests.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS This file photo from 2013 shows passengers riding escalators to access subway platforms in Sao Paulo.\n\nThe three companies that manage public transportation in the greater S\u00e3o Paulo area advise victims of sexual harassment to immediately seek help from transit employees \u2014 bus drivers or security officials at train and subway stations \u2014 and to identify perpetrators, if possible. Representatives from the companies said they had trained their employees to help these women and have been intensifying campaigns to combat harassment.\n\nMetr\u00f4, the city\u2019s subway authority, allows users to report incidents and send photos and videos to authorities via a mobile app or SMS service. The city\u2019s train authority allows also allows victims to report harassment anonymously through its own SMS service.\n\nUsed Condoms In Bags\n\nBut the reporting system hasn\u2019t been effective for everyone. Clara Novais, a 27-year-old journalist, told HuffPost Brazil that she couldn\u2019t find any subway authority to help her after a man put a used condom in her bag.\n\n\u201cI felt a liquid dripping on me and thought it might be my lunch that was leaking out of my backpack, but when I stopped to look closely, it was actually a used condom,\u201d she said. \u201cI had seen other freaky sexual cases on the subway, and my first reaction was to think, \u2018I do not believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d The alleged incident happened on a train on Oct. 2,10 days after the law took effect.\n\nNovais said she could not find an employee to help her once she got off the train. \u201cI complained on the [train authority] website and published [my account] on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cSo before going to the police station, I was interviewed by some media outlets and went to make the police report at night.\u201d\n\nOther stories began to emerge after Novais went public.\n\nRebecca Barboza, a 25-year-old designer, told HuffPost Brazil she found a condom on her belongings on the same day as Novais.\n\n\u201cIt happened on my birthday. I was already leaving the subway, on the escalator, and was distracted answering texts when I felt something cold on my back,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran my hand over it and smelled something terrible. When I took the backpack off, I saw the condom.\u201d\n\nBarboza went to a bathroom to wash her clothes and said another woman noticed she was visibly shaken. The woman brought Barboza to transit authority staff, who advised her to file a police report at a station inside the terminal.\n\nAuthorities there refused to label the offense as sexual harassment, Barboza said, and instead classified it as a misdemeanor \u201cinsult to decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the time I arrived, I said it was sexual harassment, and the official said it was not,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked why, and he said there was no physical contact.\u201d\n\nI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment. ...

And we come from a judiciary system that still needs to learn to deal with gender issues, to understand what gender violence, sexual violence, and lewd acts are.

The piece notes the practice\u2019s exorbitant cost and questions whether egg freezing is an empowering option or \u201can expensive luxury few of us can pay for or need.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, the series turns to the nasty side effects many women taking hormonal contraceptives face (and quietly tolerate \u2014 for years, in some cases).\n\nThe article asks if, given all the other options now available, we really need to put up with them.\n\nAs a whole, the series paints a striking picture of the unique burdens women bear from an early age and the ways we have attempted to assert control over our futures.\n\nThe series will end next weekend with a focus on the hushed topic of miscarriage, bringing deeply personal stories into the open.

But a Greyhound Adoptions of Florida spokesperson told Lifehacker it was more like half that, 4,000 dogs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how many will need placement, since about 1,500 to 2,000 will probably be transported to race in one of the five remaining states where racing remains legal and active, Dennis Tyler of the Greyhound Adoption Action Alliance told The New York Times\n\nTo complicate things further, there are also thousands of greyhounds in breeding facilities throughout the South and Midwest, Brooke Stumpf of GreytHounds of Eastern Michigan told NBC News.

Do I have to live in Florida?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to live in Florida to adopt a retired greyhound, since there are rescue groups around the country that receive ex-racing dogs and work to find them local homes. That means the best way to apply to adopt a greyhound is to find a rescue group near you.\n\nThe Greyhound Project Inc. has a directory of adoption groups by state on its website. If you aren\u2019t able to adopt but still want to help, you can ask an organization if it needs foster homes, volunteers or donations.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former greyhound racers Josephine, left, and Turkey.\n\nWhat should I know about greyhounds?\n\nLike any type of dog, greyhounds\u2019 personalities vary from individual to individual. That said, there are a few things to generally keep in mind if you\u2019re interested in adopting a retired greyhound.\n\nGreyhounds are known to be sociable and loving with people and are often nicknamed \u201c40 mph couch potatoes.\u201d That\u2019s because, though they can run high speeds, they also tend to spend most of their time lounging and napping.\n\nNumerous rescue groups also point out that greyhounds do need exercise and regular walks, but it\u2019s a misconception that the dogs are hyperactive or need enormous amounts of room.\n\nMichael McCann of The Greyhound Project previously told The Bark that greyhounds are great \u201cif you\u2019re looking for a dog you can take walks with, and then come home and settle right down.\u201d But, he noted, greyhounds typically are dogs that need to be in a fenced-in yard or on a leash, since they\u2019re apt to sprint off at a moment\u2019s notice if something catches their eye.\n\nMany greyhounds also have a high prey drive and are apt to chase small animals, meaning that not all of them can be safely homed with smaller pets like cats. However, many greyhounds can ultimately live in harmony with cats, so you\u2019ll need to assess your situation with the rescue group.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Greyhounds are known to give a lot of love to people."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Twitter Pelts Trump With Photos Of Obama In The Rain After He Ditches Cemetery Visit", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/twitter-pelts-trump-with-photos-of-barack-obama-in-the-rain_us_5be76113e4b0769d24cdebb7", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "As many as 1,800 American soldiers killed in the World War I battle of Belleau Wood are buried in the French cemetery.

(AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan who later became Russia\u2019s leading defender on Capitol Hill and an outspoken advocate for legalized marijuana, was defeated Saturday, a victim of California\u2019s Democratic tilt and voters\u2019 distaste for President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher, 71, was defeated by real estate executive Harley Rouda, 56, a Republican-turned-Democrat who pilloried the congressman for his skepticism over climate change and depicted him as an out-of-touch abettor in Washington gridlock.\n\nWith votes continuing to be counted, Rouda\u2019s edge grew steadily. The vote count updated Saturday showed Rouda with 52 percent of the vote and about 8,500 more votes than Rohrabacher.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s ouster from his seat in Orange County has historical and symbolic significance. The county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon and long considered a foundational block in the modern conservative movement. Reagan himself likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nBut Democrats have picked off two GOP seats either all or partly in the county since Tuesday\u2019s election, and are threatening in two others. Democrat Mike Levin this week captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county.\n\nOrange County was once a Republican lock on Election Day, said Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science at Chapman University.\n\n\u201cTheir lock is over,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven GOP-held House districts in California this year that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, including Rohrabacher\u2019s 48th. They\u2019ve now won three of those seats, with the potential to pick up three more and pad their new majority in the House.\n\nDemocrat Katie Porter is inching closer to Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters in Orange County\u2019s 45th District. In the nearby 39th District held by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce his protege, Republican Young Kim, sees her lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros tightening.\n\nIn central California\u2019s farm belt, Democrat Josh Harder grabbed a nearly 2-point lead after a vote count update Friday after trailing Rep. Jeff Denham in the 10th District.\n\nFor state Republicans, Rohrabacher\u2019s defeat represents another stinging blow for a party that has seen its fortunes wither for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million advantage in voter registrations. With Rouda\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 42-11 edge in California U.S. House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have tumbled to third-party status in the state: they are even outnumbered by registered independents.\n\nBehind the shift: A surge in immigrants in recent decades transformed the state and its voting patterns. In Orange County, largely white, conservative homeowners once delivered winning margins for GOP candidates year after year. But most of the state\u2019s new voters, Hispanics and Asians, are Democrats or independents.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to discount the influence of Trump, who lost California by over 4 million votes in 2016. California is home to the so-called Trump \u201cresistance,\u201d which has stood in opposition to his policies on the environment and immigration.\n\nRohrabacher reflects the dramatic shift of fortunes in Orange County: He was re-elected by nearly 17 points just two years but met his end when Democrats backed a wealthy, pro-business moderate in Rouda.\n\nRohrabacher has long been an unusual figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe one-time Cold Warrior transformed into an outspoken supporter of improved ties with Russia, and his name has come up in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was heard on tape in 2016 saying Rohrabacher was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCarthy\u2019s office said the comments at a private meeting, disclosed by the Washington Post, were misconstrued and McCarthy was joking with colleagues.\n\nIn the campaign, Rohrabacher was faced with the prospect of making his Reagan-era conservative views appealing to newer voters, while holding college-educated Republican women who polls suggest are turned off by Trump."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Florida Will Hold Recounts In Governor And Senate Races", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-recount-midterm-election_us_5be72482e4b0e843889869da", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Election officials in Florida announced Saturday that the state will hold recounts in its high-profile Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nFlorida Secretary of State Ken Detzner also ordered a recount in the race for agriculture commissioner.\n\nAn automatic statewide machine recount is carried out when the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percentage point.

Because we don\u2019t talk about it. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nAfter that miscarriage, she and her husband went on to conceive their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, through in vitro fertilization \u2015 a medical procedure in which eggs are extracted from a woman\u2019s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory to create embryos. If viable embryos are created, they are transferred back into the woman\u2019s body to establish a pregnancy.\n\nObama hinted in the ABC interview that the couple turned to IVF due to an issue with egg quality.\n\n\u201cThe biological clock is real because egg production is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized that as I was 34 and 35 \u2015 we had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for people facing infertility problems say that the revelation from one of the most admired women in America will help others feel less alone.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of the education and advocacy organization Fertility for Colored Girls, said that Obama\u2019s disclosure could give hope to other women of color who may be struggling alone with their infertility.\n\n\u201cSo many black women [and] couples live in silence and shame for so many reasons, including myths and misconceptions about black women being hyper-fertile,\u201d Edwards-Dunn said. \u201c[Michelle Obama] just gave so many women permission to exhale and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alone, and I too can get support and help to become a parent!\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s story will open up more conversations about infertility and black women, said Edwards-Dunn, who has gone through seven IVF cycles herself and now has a 4-year-old child conceived from the treatments.\n\n\u201cNot only is this the first time that we hear of a first lady being so transparent about her personal fertility challenges, but her courageous truth-telling gives more women, particularly black women and couples, the courage to talk about their own challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aaron Styer, an African-American reproductive endocrinologist and founding partner of the fertility clinic CCRM Boston, said this could encourage more couples to visit a doctor.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most respected and revered women of color, Michelle Obama\u2019s openness to discuss her IVF treatments will open that dialogue and empower black women and all women, men, and couples facing infertility to seek these treatments to conceive,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of the infertility advocacy group RESOLVE, similarly hopes that Obama\u2019s news might inspire others to act.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day impact really happens when people who care about this issue talk to their employers about adding family building benefits to help them, when they talk to their lawmakers about policy change, and when we as a community make sure that anyone struggling to build a family has access to information and support,\u201d said Collura.\n\nInfertility can strike all races, ethnicities and economic groups. Overall, about 12 percent of women in the U.S. have problems either getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.\n\nBut black women have higher rates of infertility (defined as unprotected sex with a man for more than one year without a pregnancy) and higher rates of pregnancy loss between 10 and 20 weeks gestation. The cause may be a complex mix of medical issues including higher rates of fibroids, obesity, and blocked fallopian tubes \u2015 all factors that can affect fertility, said Styer.\n\nBlack women are also less likely than other groups to seek medical help for infertility. A 2015 study surveying 300 reproductive-age women with infertility found that black women were less likely to visit a doctor for help getting pregnant and that they waited twice as long as white women before seeking help.\n\nResearchers say this is the result of both cultural and practical barriers to medical care. There is some evidence that black women in particular feel they can\u2019t reach out for support and experience shame about their condition because of the expectation (and stigma) that black women are especially fertile.\n\nBut the most significant problem may be rooted in more practical concerns: Black women trying to get infertility treatment say it\u2019s more difficult for them to get doctor\u2019s appointments, take time off from work and pay for treatment.\n\nIVF is a common medical treatment, and more than one million babies have been born in the U.S. thanks to the technology. But most people who have fertility issues will never be able to access this or other treatments. Among women interviewed for the 2006\u20132010 National Survey of Family Growth, only 3.1 percent of those with fertility issues had ever used assisted reproductive technology like IVF.\n\nThis could be because the average couple going through IVF will spend more than $24,000 in an 18-month period. And this is likely to be an out-of-pocket cost, as infertility treatment is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nEven when black women are able to seek help, the best treatments that medical science has for infertility don\u2019t seem to work as well with them. A study of about 4,000 women undergoing their first IVF cycle found that black women had lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and a live birth compared to white women, along with higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nStill, fingers are crossed that Obama\u2019s disclosure will at least drive more women of color to consult with fertility clinics \u2015 just as Angelina Jolie\u2019s 2013 New York Times op-ed caused a spike in genetic testing for breast cancer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "I'm Not Deaf But I'm Not Hearing. Where Do I Belong?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hard-of-hearing-not-deaf_us_5be20252e4b0769d24c61c87", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "I\u2019m too hard of hearing to be considered part of the hearing world, but I\u2019m not deaf enough to be considered part of the Deaf world.\n\nI was born with a moderate bilateral high-frequency hearing loss. According to my family, I had enough hearing to adapt to the hearing world and attend mainstream school. I struggled through school, not only to hear my teachers \u2015 some of whom begged for my parents to get me hearing aids \u2015 but also to hear my classmates. I felt isolated and disconnected from people most of the time, even though my mother is deaf and the Deaf world was part of my life. I experienced the jokes, bullying and rejections of growing up hard of hearing in a world where everyone can hear.\n\nYet I did learn how to adapt to the hearing world. I learned to read lips, decipher body language, and find patterns in daily activities to predict conversations. (People are predictable.) I even use reading to learn new words so it will be easier for me to grasp words within conversations. I\u2019m grateful that I understand at least 85 percent of most conversations around me. I can glide around mainstream culture and act as if I have normal hearing even if I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids.\n\nIf I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids, I pretend I can hear everything when I really don\u2019t, just to be part of the hearing world. The truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on. On most days, that works.\n\nI use my phone flash for notifications and captions to watch TV. I ask people to repeat themselves, and I can\u2019t follow a group conversation in a noisy restaurant. I can\u2019t walk and listen at the same time. I need to see a person\u2019s face to get the full conversation. I have to strain to hear certain voices \u2015 like children\u2019s \u2015 even if I have hearing aids. The aftermath is that I get exhausted more easily. Then I avoid these necessary social interactions, even if I want to be a part of them. These challenges leave me feeling isolated, lonely and fatigued.\n\nThe truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I fit into the hearing world. But I don\u2019t fit into the Deaf world either.\n\nMy mom gave me an inherited connection to the Deaf world. She is immersed in the Deaf culture \u2015 a vibrant, talented beautiful community. Profoundly deaf in one ear since birth, my mother attended schools for Deaf children and uses interpreters to communicate with the hearing world. Her experiences provide her with a sense of belonging to the Deaf world, but they also come with constant discrimination from the hearing world.\n\nThere are some differences that create a disconnection between me and the Deaf world. As a CODA \u2015 child of a deaf adult \u2015 when I\u2019m with Deaf friends, my default role becomes that of an unofficial interpreter. I become the assigned interpreter of the group because I have enough hearing to carry a conversation with a hearing person. I remember having to interpret for my mother as a child. I was forced to interpret for her at doctor\u2019s appointments, government offices and everywhere else. Most times, I\u2019d have to miss school to attend these appointments with her.\n\nWhile the ADA law states that an interpreter must be provided to a Deaf person, the reality is that more often than not, an interpreter is not offered. So I interpret for her, but having moderate hearing loss affects my ability to interpret. I always feel anxious; I have to listen to all the verbal and non-verbal cues of the speaker, process the message, and translate to American Sign Language (ASL) \u2015 all while delivering the message simultaneously to the Deaf person. This is a much more involved and complicated process that I have not fully mastered even after years of practice.\n\nMy hearing usually leaves me uncertain of the message and stressed about the implication of delivering it incorrectly. Basically, I am terrified of getting it wrong. If I\u2019m interpreting for a friend at a doctor\u2019s office, misunderstanding how many pills she has to take can result in an overdose. Many times, a person can fully hear the message someone else is trying to communicate but doesn\u2019t understand it. This added stress makes me shy away from Deaf friends. I feel guilty because I want to relax with friends without the pressure of interpreting.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture.\n\nAnother reason I don\u2019t fit entirely into the Deaf world is that I don\u2019t need to use some of the resources available to that community. I don\u2019t personally use an interpreter to communicate. I don\u2019t need a flashing doorbell or flashing smoke alarms. I don\u2019t need video phones. I learned ASL as a child but I mainly communicate with my voice, speaking English or Spanish to friends and family.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture. In the past, I\u2019ve been discouraged from using my voice and pushed to only communicate in ASL. But using my voice is part of who I am, not a denial of the Deaf culture.\n\nI have a hearing husband and two sons, one whom is hard of hearing. None of them have fully mastered ASL. Learning a language is difficult and requires years of practice. Even if my husband and sons take the time to learn the language, they may never be completely fluent. Thus, we still use our voices at home when we communicate.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the Deaf community has been welcoming to me. I\u2019ve always wanted to feel like I belonged in both the Deaf and hearing worlds, but I don\u2019t fully feel a part of either.\n\nAs I continue my journey, I realize how badly I need more accessibility, compassion and acceptance from the hearing world. I don\u2019t use the same resources other people with hearing loss may request, but I still need certain accommodations. I rely on subtitles, and as a consumer of all media platforms, I still find gaps when I access videos. Video feeds have expanded; the option to caption videos in all platforms should expand as well. This is especially true for live video streams such as Instagram Live. As a creator of Facebook and Instagram videos, I find myself with limited captioning options, so I understand the limitations. Yet it is a necessary feature.\n\nAs noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nFace-to-face conversations are perfect opportunities to show compassion. It\u2019s helpful when people look at me while they speak and don\u2019t get frustrated if I ask them to repeat themselves. It\u2019s hard for me to hear people when they cover their mouths, turn away from me or talk to me from another room. Some people get frustrated when I ask them to repeat themselves, and their first response is to say, \u201cnevermind.\u201d Nevermind sounds to me like \u201cYou are not worth my time.\u201d As noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nAbove all, I would like for people to accept that despite my hearing loss, I can accomplish anything I want. I\u2019m neither lucky nor unlucky. I\u2019m a professional writer, a data analyst, and I\u2019m successful in my life. My hearing loss is not a hindrance. My hearing loss does not determine my intelligence, skills, talent, focus or the lack thereof. I am hard of hearing and I work hard to succeed. I use all the resources I need to make my life work for me. Any hinderance I face comes from the unacceptability of my uniqueness.\n\nI invite the hearing world to embrace our differences so we can learn from each other and create a new world full of opportunities and adventures for everyone."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Gab, Social Network Favored By The Far Right, Goes Back Online", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gab-back-online_us_5be01052e4b09d43e32099a9", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Gab, a social network popular among alt-right activists and white nationalists, went back online Sunday after having gone dark following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, which killed 11 people.\n\nThe platform, a self-labeled champion of free speech, was dropped by domain provider GoDaddy.com last week.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013. (Rubin disputes the claim.)\n\nGetty Editorial Google employees at its European headquarters in Dublin join others around the world in walking out of their offices on Nov. 1 in protest over claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism at the tech giant.\n\nThe company gave three executives similarly cushy treatment, even though it did not have any legal obligation to do so, the Times found.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we have terminated 48 people, including 13 senior managers and above for sexual harassment,\u201d Pichai noted in his email. \u201cNone of these people received an exit package.

Most chronic diseases have been tied to deviations in gut microbiome, though the specifics of cause and effect still need to be parsed out."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Idaho, Nebraska and Utah Vote to Expand Medicaid", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/health/medicaid-expansion-ballot.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 09:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Despite the uncertainty and partisan gridlock that Tuesday\u2019s election results ensure, one policy change seems guaranteed: hundreds of thousands more poor Americans in red states will qualify for free health coverage through Medicaid.\n\nVoters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, which President Trump won easily in 2016, approved ballot initiatives to expand the government insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. Democratic victories in governors\u2019 races also improved the chances of Medicaid expansion in Kansas and Wisconsin, and all but ensured it in Maine. As a result, Medicaid could see its biggest enrollment bump since the health law began allowing expansion in 2014.\n\nFor all the campaign warfare over the health law\u2019s effect on insurance premiums and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Medicaid has remained quite popular. In a Kaiser poll last month, 56 percent of people across the 17 states that had not yet expanded Medicaid said they favored doing so. And the share of people saying Medicaid was \u201cvery important\u201d to them grew to nearly half during efforts to repeal the health law last year, Kaiser found.\n\n\u201cMedicaid per se is much more popular than the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Robert Blendon, a health policy expert at Harvard who has closely followed public opinion of the health law. \u201cAnd the people organizing these referendums on Medicaid expansion aren\u2019t making them about the A.C.A. They\u2019re taking a program that\u2019s been in the state for years and adding to it, saying, \u2018All these other people need coverage and we can get outside money for it.\u2019\u201d"}]
