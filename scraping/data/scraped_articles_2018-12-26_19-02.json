For the past month, they have been contending with confusion and disorder.\n\nUncertainty abounds at the end of a volatile year: Investors question the Federal Reserve's plans for 2019, and President Donald Trump asked aides if he could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Congress entered a budget stalemate with the president, partially shutting down the government. Trade policy that for years tried to stitch economies together is in retreat. Economists warn that the pace of US economic growth will slow next year.\n\nTo cap that off, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin issued a bizarre statement Sunday , saying he called top bank executives to assess their liquidity. He asked if they had the ability to continue lending to consumers and businesses \u2014 at a time when confidence in banks had been high.\n\nThat set already jittery investors on edge. Stocks followed their worst week since the Great Recession by plummeting yet again Monday . The last time the market fell this much in December was in 1931 , during the Great Depression.\n\nInvestors are now worried about five big items going into 2019.\n\n1. Mnuchin may know something we don't. Or not\n\nBear markets happen. Several stock indexes are down 20% from their highs, yet US markets' descent has happened relatively gradually \u2014 until recent weeks.\n\nMnuchin used crisis language when he said banks have \"ample liquidity\" and \"markets continue to function properly.\" No outward signs pointed to a crisis, contagion or liquidity concern in the financial system. Suggesting as much jolted the stock market.\n\nTrump has complained that Mnuchin hasn't done enough to stabilize markets, according to a person familiar with the matter. The statement left observers wondering: Was Mnuchin trying to placate Trump, or does he know something the markets don't know?\n\n2. The mix of higher rates and slowing economy growth\n\nBusinesses and investors were already on high alert because rates are going up as economic growth is slowing. They have good reason to worry that Powell's Fed may be too aggressive on its rate increases. The Fed lowered its growth estimate for the US economy last week, and it is notoriously horrendous at predicting recessions.\n\nIf it raises rates too quickly, the Fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession. Inflation is not currently a problem, so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate-raising pace if it wants.\n\nThe Fed signaled it would raise rates only twice next year after raising them four times in 2018. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams sought to reassure investors Friday that the Fed will remain flexible about its rate-raising and balance sheet policy if the markets take a turn for the worse. But investors weren't buying it: The Dow fell more than 400 points Friday.\n\n3. Trouble at the Fed\n\nThe Fed is only doing its job : It is expected to independently assess the state of business and the economy and determine the best course of action for monetary policy. Yet Trump threatens to undermine a Fed chair that he appointed his own appointed Fed chair by publicly criticizing him and privately asking if he can fire him.\n\nInvestors may not like the uncertainty that higher rates could bring \u2014 but firing the Fed chair 10 months into his term would be a different can of worms entirely.\n\nFor months, Trump has been lashing out at Powell, the nominee Trump considers the worst of his presidency. Trump believes Powell is to blame for this year's market turmoil, but few thought Trump would actually fire him, which could create chaos in the markets. Yet CNN and other media reported that Trump has begun polling advisers about whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.\n\nMnuchin tried to calm markets Saturday by tweeting that Trump never suggested that he would fire Powell \u2014 and Trump doesn't believe he has the right to oust the Fed chair. But Trump's ouster of Defense Secretary James Mattis months ahead of his planned resignation date concerned investors that Trump may not be listening to his advisers.\n\nits their \"touch.\" On Monday morning, Trump again attacked the Fed , likening it to a golfer who has losttheir \"touch.\"\n\n4. Shutdown showdown\n\nThe government shutdown probably won't mean much for the economy in the near term, but Washington's dysfunction isn't a great sign.\n\nFar more meaningful than a shutdown is Congress' duty to lift the debt ceiling later next year.\n\nAfter starting to recover after the Great Recession, federal deficits are rising again \u2014 and that means Treasury will have to borrow more to make up the gap between what the government spends and brings in. Lawmakers must pass a law next year so Treasury can continue to borrow without any restrictions. If they fail, the government could default on its debt.\n\nThat very nearly happened in 2011, and credit-rating agency Standard and Poor's downgraded America one notch below a perfect AAA. Another downgrade could make the United States' already massive debt load much costlier to pay back.\n\n5. Trade\n\nThe US-China trade war is on hiatus until March, but it still looms over the economy and markets.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if China fails to meet US demands on a variety of economic and political issues.\n\nTrade has dominated much of the conversation in 2018. It says a lot about the chaos in Washington that trade is currently the least of the market's concerns."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "White House tries again to reassure Wall Street", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nHHsNIvBu6k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The White House sought to project a message of stability on Wednesday about the US economy amid ongoing market volatility triggered in part by confusing signals sent in recent days by President Donald Trump and his top advisers.\n\nKevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's job is \"100%\" safe, despite Trump's vocal complaints about the central bank's decision to raise interest rates -- including in comments to reporters on Christmas Day.\n\nHassett instead blamed market volatility on \"fundamentals,\" noting, \"Growth in Europe has slowed; growth in Asia has slowed.\"\n\nBut he said the US economy continues to be strong.\n\n\"All the anecdotal info that we're getting is that the fundamentals remain extremely sound,\" Hassett said. \"Christmas sales were through the roof.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "See Trump's response when asked about Mnuchin", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Ngt7mFGwZlQ/trump-white-house-mnuchin-federal-reserve-comments-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House and answered a question about US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and discussed the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Treasury chief may be in 'serious jeopardy'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/0zt0sSLO3uE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's frustration with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is ratcheting up further after markets suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever following Mnuchin's attempts to calm Wall Street failed, according to a source close to the White House.\n\nThe source told CNN that Mnuchin could be in \"serious jeopardy\" with Trump, who regularly rages at Cabinet members he feels have made mistakes before he cools off.\n\nTrump nevertheless vouched for Mnuchin publicly, shifting blame for the market volatility to the Federal Reserve instead.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Trump said Tuesday when asked whether he had confidence in Mnuchin. \"Very talented, very smart person.\"\n\nBut the source painted a different picture of Mnuchin's standing behind the scenes.\n\n\"Mnuchin is under the gun,\" the source said.\n\nThe Treasury secretary left Washington for a Christmas holiday in Mexico's Cabo San Lucas as the federal government shut down over the weekend, while Trump canceled his own planned trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and remained cooped up in the White House over the holiday, absorbing a flood of negative news about the markets.\n\nTrump could meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the new year, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Wednesday morning. Trump has fumed at Powell for raising interest rates, which Trump believes is driving the stock market lower. Some of the President's aides believe a face-to-face meeting could help ease tensions and allow the two men to discuss the underlying economy.\n\nMnuchin meets regularly with Powell and it's not unheard of for a Fed chair to meet with the President, though it's rare since the position is meant to be independent of politics.\n\nNothing has been formally scheduled. The Wall Street Journal first reported the discussions about the meeting.\n\nAt the same time in Washington, Mnuchin aides have been scrambling to find economic data to help their boss calm Trump down, but Trump was said to be unhappy with what Mnuchin was telling him, this source said.\n\nAn administration source dismissed the latest round of rumors that the secretary's continued tenure was on the line.\n\n\"This is nonsense,\" they said.\n\nOver the weekend, the secretary spoke by phone with the President several times, including after a brutal trading day on Christmas Eve resulting in a 653-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to the administration source. The two men spoke on a variety of issues, including the government shutdown and an update on the status of trade talks.\n\nMnuchin, a former investment banker and film financier, has long been one of Trump's closest advisers, dating back to his time working with Trump on the 2016 presidential campaign. Still, sources have previously told CNN that Trump was upset with Mnuchin over his advice to appoint Powell as Federal Reserve chairman. Trump has criticized Powell and the Fed for increasing interest rates, subjecting Powell to the kind of scathing public critique that is common for senior Trump appointees but which threatens the political independence of the worlds most powerful central bank.\n\nWall Street has been exceptionally volatile all December, with investors already jumpy about signs of a global slowdown repeatedly spooked by Trump's own comments. The slide started in earnest with the President's own tweets following his announcement of a trade deal with Beijing, in which he suggested he may yet impose radically higher tariffs if he's not happy with negotiations.\n\nMnuchin turned heads in Washington and Wall Street with his attempts to calm the markets over the weekend in an attempt to head off a plunge.\n\nMnuchin tweeted on Saturday that he had spoken with Trump and issued a quote that he attributed to the President denying Trump had suggested firing Powell. Two sources previously told CNN that Trump had begun polling advisers on whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.\n\nMnuchin then spoke with the heads of major US banks on Sunday and issued a statement that evening saying the banks had \"ample liquidity.\"\n\nBut his efforts to calm markets that have been volatile for weeks appeared to fail on Monday.\n\nThe Dow dropped by 2.9% and the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, the biggest drops ever for the two indexes on Christmas Eve. That same day, Trump fired off a series of tweets, including one attacking the Federal Reserve.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Trump said he remained confident in Mnuchin but was still unhappy with the Fed.\n\n\"They're raising interest rates too fast,\" Trump said of the central bank."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "British-Iranian professor returns to UK after detention in Iran", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/NHb75Vat634/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Abbas Edalat, a British-Iranian professor who was arrested and detained in Iran for eight months, has returned to the UK, according to British authorities.\n\n\"We can confirm that a British-Iranian dual national who was detained in Tehran has returned to the UK,\" a UK Foreign Office representative told CNN on Wednesday. \"We continue to take action on all our consular cases in Iran in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases.\"\n\nIranian security forces arrested Edalat in April on security charges after he was accused of being part of a British-affiliated, anti-Iran group that allegedly launched espionage operations and had contacts with leaders of mass anti-government protests in 2009, according to Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency.\n\nNo further details on the charges were given, and the group that Edalat was accused of being affiliated with was not identified.\n\nEdalat, an award-winning Imperial College London professor of computer science and mathematics, is a prominent activist who founded the Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran in 2005.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Border official announces changes after 2 migrant children die in US custody", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/lc4y9MY5aqQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) What used to be an \"extraordinarily rare occurrence\" has already happened twice this month -- the death of a child in the custody of US border officials.\n\nNow the head of Customs and Border Protection is reiterating calls for Congress to provide more funding to handle the influx of migrants crossing the border.\n\n\"I've explained to Congress ... that what we're seeing with these flows, of huge numbers of families with lots of children, young children, as well as unaccompanied minors coming into Border Patrol custody after crossing the border unlawfully, that our stations are not built for that group that's crossing today,\" CBP Commissioner Kevin K.

The agency also is reviewing other custody options to relieve capacity issues in the El Paso, Texas, sector, such as working with nongovernmental organizations or local partners for temporary housing.\n\n\u2022 Third, CBP is considering options for medical assistance with other governmental partners, the agency said. That could include support from the Coast Guard as well as possibly more aid from the Defense Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u2022 Finally, CBP is reviewing its policies, with a focus on the care and custody of children under 10 -- both at intake and beyond 24 hours in custody, the agency said.\n\nWhat happened to the 8-year-old boy\n\nCBP released a timeline of the days before the boy's death . On Monday, the boy was taken to a hospital, diagnosed with a cold, released with medication, then taken back to the hospital before dying about 12 minutes before Christmas.\n\nThe cause of the boy's death is not clear. But an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday in Albuquerque, according to the University of New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator\n\nCastro called for a congressional investigation into the boy's death.\n\n\"While the CBP notified Congress within 24 hours as mandated by law, we must ensure that we treat migrants and asylum-seekers with human dignity and provide the necessary medical care to anyone in the custody of the United States government,\" the congressman said Tuesday.\n\nAsylum A protected status that allows people fleeing persecution to live legally in another country.\n\nMany people wonder why asylum-seekers cross illegally rather than at a legal point of entry.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Fifty-seven years later, Gabriel Bach still pauses to compose himself when he tells the story of the girl in the red coat. Bach took time to speak with me last week about his experience as one of three Israeli prosecutors who tried the notorious Nazi logistics director Adolf Eichmann for war crimes in Jerusalem in 1961.\n\nBach, now 91, still remembers the testimony of one particular Holocaust survivor. Responding to Bach's questioning, the survivor, Dr. Martin Foldi, described how he was transported in a cattle car from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944 with his wife, son and daughter. Upon arrival, two lines formed. A Nazi guard signaled for Foldi to go right and Foldi's wife, son and daughter to go left.\n\nFoldi had recently bought a red coat for his daughter, who was 2\u00bd years old. When Foldi looked up a few moments after being separated from his family, he could no longer see his wife or son in the distance. But, Bach recalls, Foldi testified he could see \"that little red dot getting smaller and smaller -- this is how my family disappeared from my life.\"\n\nLike any good prosecutor, Bach tried to maintain an unflappable demeanor. However, even in a trial recounting countless colossal horrors, Bach said the testimony about the red coat was the \"only minute of the trial ... I suddenly couldn't utter a sound.\" Aware that the judges were waiting for him to continue and that television cameras were rolling, Bach pretended to shuffle papers on his desk to allow himself a moment to recover.\n\nBach's life story is particularly relevant today given the rising tide of ethnic and racial intolerance -- and extremist attacks borne of such hatred -- in the United States and across the globe. More than five decades ago, as the whole world watched, Bach faced down Eichmann, an infamous Nazi officer who perpetrated genocide on a nearly unthinkable scale, in a courtroom in Israel. The lessons from the Eichmann trial -- about the rule of law, the quest for justice and the dangers posed by ethnic hatred -- still resonate today.\n\nEichmann was known as the \" architect \" of the Holocaust because he was responsible for identifying, gathering and transporting millions of Jews and others to concentration camps across Europe. Bach refers to Eichmann as the \"director of the Holocaust\" because of his central role in planning and carrying out the execution of millions of innocents.\n\nProsecuting the architect of the Holocaust\n\nAmerican forces captured Eichmann at the end of World War II, but he escaped from a prison camp in 1946. He remained in hiding while an international manhunt ensued. Fourteen years after Eichmann's escape, Israeli intelligence agents captured him in Argentina in 1960 (as depicted in several books and movies, including 2018's \" Operation Finale \") and then transported him to Jerusalem for trial.\n\nThe trial began in April 1961. Bach led the prosecution team's investigation, gathering witnesses, documents, film and other evidence from around the globe. He presented testimony from numerous witnesses, including survivors with remarkable stories; one had been a young child who was let out of a locked gas chamber just before execution to help unload a delivery of potatoes that had arrived at the camp. Bach felt it was important that the court hear from at least one survivor from every Nazi-occupied country.\n\nAdolf Eichmann, the Holocaust's \"architect,\" goes on trial in Jerusalem in 1961 after Israel captured him.\n\nOver four months, the world watched as Bach and his colleagues methodically laid out the proof of Eichmann's crimes. During the trial, Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass box. Bach sat just feet away at counsel's table. Bach recalls that, throughout the trial, Eichmann was stoic and unemotional.\n\nEichmann and his court-appointed attorney maintained during the trial that he merely followed orders from his Nazi superiors. Hannah Arendt, who covered the trial for The New Yorker, later contended in her controversial book \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" that Eichmann embodied the \"banality of evil.\" Arendt wrote, \"Eichmann was not Iago and not Macbeth. ... Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement, he had no motives at all. ... He merely, to put the matter colloquially, never realized what he was doing.\"\n\nBach responds to Arendt's conclusion first with visceral disgust -- he calls her view \"rubbish\" -- and then with the methodical precision of a skilled prosecutor. Bach notes that Eichmann declared after the Holocaust (but before the 1961 trial) that he regretted not having done more to kill Jews. Bach then reels off examples where Eichmann took pains to prevent any person from being spared or shown mercy.\n\nIn one instance, a German general requested that a French Jewish man who was an expert in radar technology be spared so his knowledge could be utilized; Eichmann rejected the request and ordered the man deported to a concentration camp. Bach also notes that Eichmann believed it was imperative to kill children, to prevent the maturation of future generations of Jews. Arendt can have her theorizing; Bach is secure resting on the hard facts.\n\nEichmann stands in a protective glass booth flanked by Israeli police during his 1961 war crimes trial.\n\nAt the end of the trial, a three-judge panel convicted Eichmann of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other offenses, and sentenced him to death. Eichmann appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, where Bach successfully defended the verdict and sentence. Eichmann was executed by hanging on June 1, 1962. Bach was offered the opportunity to witness the execution but declined.\n\nBach does not seek to cast himself in an angelic glow, candidly acknowledging that \"I was so much full of hatred for this man (Eichmann).\" Bach takes pride, however, that despite the intense emotion surrounding the case, Eichmann was tried in accordance with established rule of law and principles of fairness. Bach, who tried many cases as prosecutor and defense attorney before the Eichmann trial, notes that \"we wanted to handle this case like we handled any other case.\"\n\nIndeed, Eichmann, the most notorious of all criminals, was afforded the same rights as other defendants in Israel at the time (which also are familiar to the American criminal justice system): the right to competent defense counsel, paid for by the state; the right to see the evidence against him in advance; the right to evidence that might be helpful to the defense; the right to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses and to call his own witnesses; and the right to appeal. Bach understood that \"it was important for history's sake that every point of legal decency had to be followed.\"\n\n'Always sort of just one step ahead'\n\nAt 91, Bach sees that he has lived an almost impossibly charmed life. Bach grew up in Berlin, where he attended the 1936 Olympics and sat so close to Adolf Hitler that he says he saw Hitler leave his private box in anger after Jesse Owens sprinted to a gold medal. Bach's Jewish family fled from Germany for the Netherlands just weeks before Kristallnacht -- when the rising Nazi party destroyed Jewish homes and properties and killed dozens of German Jews -- in November 1938.\n\nHis family then left the Netherlands one month before the Nazis invaded in 1940 and moved to the territory that would later become Israel. Bach was bar mitzvahed while in transit, on board the ship Patria -- which, on its next journey, was sunk by a bomb placed on board by Zionists -- claiming the lives of more than 250 people. Bach reflects that he and his family were \"always sort of just one step ahead.\"\n\nBach holds a photo as he tours the 2011 exhibit \"Facing Justice -- Adolf Eichmann on Trial\" in Berlin.\n\nAfter the Eichmann trial, Bach went on to a distinguished legal career, including 15 years as a justice on the Israeli Supreme Court. He now lives a quiet, happy life with his wife in Jerusalem. They have three grown children (one of whom has passed) and eight grandchildren. In his advanced age, Bach still has a sparkle in his eye, an easy laugh and a natural warmth. He has a steel trap memory for the details of the Eichmann trial and a deep faith in and respect for the rule of law.\n\nBach has spoken about his life and the Eichmann trial countless times on five continents, in countries as disparate as Brazil, Japan, South Africa and the Philippines. He has spoken many times in Germany, including in Berlin at the Parliament, where he was moved by the warm reception he received. In Israel, he is a national hero and was greeted at a recent speaking appearance with a thunderous standing ovation from a sellout crowd.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Nor can he fathom why so many people know little or nothing about the Holocaust or doubt that it ever happened.\n\nHe does, however, hold out hope that the Eichmann trial will stand through history as an unambiguous condemnation of ethnic hatred and violence. \"The fact that this terrible thing happened should never be forgotten,\" Bach says. \"And everything should be done to teach young people and older people to prevent something like that from happening in the future. That is my hope.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "What's worrying investors going into 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/zSHxFHj-iT4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) Wall Street, markets and business crave certainty.

The mix of higher rates and slowing economy growth\n\nBusinesses and investors were already on high alert because rates are going up as economic growth is slowing. They have good reason to worry that Powell's Fed may be too aggressive on its rate increases. The Fed lowered its growth estimate for the US economy last week, and it is notoriously horrendous at predicting recessions.\n\nIf it raises rates too quickly, the Fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession. Inflation is not currently a problem, so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate-raising pace if it wants.\n\nThe Fed signaled it would raise rates only twice next year after raising them four times in 2018. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams sought to reassure investors Friday that the Fed will remain flexible about its rate-raising and balance sheet policy if the markets take a turn for the worse. But investors weren't buying it: The Dow fell more than 400 points Friday.\n\n3. Trouble at the Fed\n\nThe Fed is only doing its job : It is expected to independently assess the state of business and the economy and determine the best course of action for monetary policy. Yet Trump threatens to undermine a Fed chair that he appointed his own appointed Fed chair by publicly criticizing him and privately asking if he can fire him.\n\nInvestors may not like the uncertainty that higher rates could bring \u2014 but firing the Fed chair 10 months into his term would be a different can of worms entirely.\n\nFor months, Trump has been lashing out at Powell, the nominee Trump considers the worst of his presidency. Trump believes Powell is to blame for this year's market turmoil, but few thought Trump would actually fire him, which could create chaos in the markets. Yet CNN and other media reported that Trump has begun polling advisers about whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.\n\nMnuchin tried to calm markets Saturday by tweeting that Trump never suggested that he would fire Powell \u2014 and Trump doesn't believe he has the right to oust the Fed chair. But Trump's ouster of Defense Secretary James Mattis months ahead of his planned resignation date concerned investors that Trump may not be listening to his advisers.\n\nits their \"touch.\" On Monday morning, Trump again attacked the Fed , likening it to a golfer who has losttheir \"touch.\"\n\n4. Shutdown showdown\n\nThe government shutdown probably won't mean much for the economy in the near term, but Washington's dysfunction isn't a great sign.\n\nFar more meaningful than a shutdown is Congress' duty to lift the debt ceiling later next year.\n\nAfter starting to recover after the Great Recession, federal deficits are rising again \u2014 and that means Treasury will have to borrow more to make up the gap between what the government spends and brings in. Lawmakers must pass a law next year so Treasury can continue to borrow without any restrictions. If they fail, the government could default on its debt.\n\nThat very nearly happened in 2011, and credit-rating agency Standard and Poor's downgraded America one notch below a perfect AAA. Another downgrade could make the United States' already massive debt load much costlier to pay back.\n\n5. Trade\n\nThe US-China trade war is on hiatus until March, but it still looms over the economy and markets.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if China fails to meet US demands on a variety of economic and political issues.\n\nTrade has dominated much of the conversation in 2018. It says a lot about the chaos in Washington that trade is currently the least of the market's concerns."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Family of black wrestler forced to cut his dreadlocks speaks out", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/shtSOar5z_A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The parents of the 16-year-old black varsity wrestler who was forced to cut his dreadlocks before a match have spoken out for the first time since the incident.\n\nCharles and Rosa Johnson, speaking through their attorney, Dominic A.

The agency also is reviewing other custody options to relieve capacity issues in the El Paso, Texas, sector, such as working with nongovernmental organizations or local partners for temporary housing.\n\n\u2022 Third, CBP is considering options for medical assistance with other governmental partners, the agency said. That could include support from the Coast Guard as well as possibly more aid from the Defense Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u2022 Finally, CBP is reviewing its policies, with a focus on the care and custody of children under 10 -- both at intake and beyond 24 hours in custody, the agency said.\n\nWhat happened to the 8-year-old boy\n\nCBP released a timeline of the days before the boy's death . On Monday, the boy was taken to a hospital, diagnosed with a cold, released with medication, then taken back to the hospital before dying about 12 minutes before Christmas.\n\nThe cause of the boy's death is not clear. But an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday in Albuquerque, according to the University of New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator\n\nCastro called for a congressional investigation into the boy's death.\n\n\"While the CBP notified Congress within 24 hours as mandated by law, we must ensure that we treat migrants and asylum-seekers with human dignity and provide the necessary medical care to anyone in the custody of the United States government,\" the congressman said Tuesday.\n\nAsylum A protected status that allows people fleeing persecution to live legally in another country.\n\nMany people wonder why asylum-seekers cross illegally rather than at a legal point of entry.

The two men spoke on a variety of issues, including the government shutdown and an update on the status of trade talks.\n\nMnuchin, a former investment banker and film financier, has long been one of Trump's closest advisers, dating back to his time working with Trump on the 2016 presidential campaign. Still, sources have previously told CNN that Trump was upset with Mnuchin over his advice to appoint Powell as Federal Reserve chairman. Trump has criticized Powell and the Fed for increasing interest rates, subjecting Powell to the kind of scathing public critique that is common for senior Trump appointees but which threatens the political independence of the worlds most powerful central bank.\n\nWall Street has been exceptionally volatile all December, with investors already jumpy about signs of a global slowdown repeatedly spooked by Trump's own comments. The slide started in earnest with the President's own tweets following his announcement of a trade deal with Beijing, in which he suggested he may yet impose radically higher tariffs if he's not happy with negotiations.\n\nMnuchin turned heads in Washington and Wall Street with his attempts to calm the markets over the weekend in an attempt to head off a plunge.\n\nMnuchin tweeted on Saturday that he had spoken with Trump and issued a quote that he attributed to the President denying Trump had suggested firing Powell. Two sources previously told CNN that Trump had begun polling advisers on whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.\n\nMnuchin then spoke with the heads of major US banks on Sunday and issued a statement that evening saying the banks had \"ample liquidity.\"\n\nBut his efforts to calm markets that have been volatile for weeks appeared to fail on Monday.\n\nThe Dow dropped by 2.9% and the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, the biggest drops ever for the two indexes on Christmas Eve.

It is even possible that it could still be underway when the new Congress starts in early January.\n\nHere's a look at the latest on negotiations and the outlook for the partial shutdown:\n\nHow long is the shutdown expected to last?\n\nThe President's incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that \"it is very possible that the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress\" during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nA spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told CNN Sunday that \"if Director Mulvaney says the Trump Shutdown will last into the New Year, believe him \u2014 because it's their shutdown.\"\n\nSchumer made a counteroffer on border security, according to a Democratic source familiar with the negotiations -- before Saturday when he met with Vice President Mike Pence -- to Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby and that was rejected by the White House. Pence then made his own offer on Saturday, which was rejected by Schumer.\n\nSchumer and Shelby have been having side discussions, but they don't appear to have yielded much progress given the differences between Schumer and the White House, the source added.\n\nThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no deal to re-open the government, and while there will be a pro forma Senate session on Monday, the next actual session is not scheduled until Thursday.\n\nLawmakers can travel home for Christmas and won't have to worry about being called back to vote until a deal can be reached, but GOP leaders told senators that if there is no deal by Thursday, they would not have to return for that session, sources have told CNN.\n\nWhat are the next possible steps?\n\nThere is a remote possibility that a deal could come together sooner, and in the unlikely event a deal is reached by Monday, the pro forma session could be used to pass it by unanimous consent or voice vote, something that would only require one senator to be in attendance.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Schumer have said that the new Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will pass a bill to stop the shutdown if it lasts into the new Congress.\n\n\"If President Trump and Republicans choose to continue this Trump Shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January,\" the Democratic leaders said in a joint statement after the shutdown started.\n\nWhere do negotiations stand between the President and Democrats?\n\nThe key sticking point in the spending standoff is President Donald Trump's demand for $5 billion for a border wall. And so far, there is still no agreement to resolve the standoff and re-open the government.\n\nHouse Republicans passed a spending bill that included an additional $5 billion for the wall last week, but the legislation is considered dead on arrival in the Senate where Democrats have said they would not support it. Any spending bill needs at least some Democratic votes to pass in the Senate.\n\nVice President Mike Pence proposed spending $2.5 billion on border security, including the wall, in a stopgap spending bill during meetings on Friday night and Saturday afternoon with Schumer, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSeveral of the sources said there were policy additions and restrictions included in the proposal to try to bridge the gap. But Democrats said the number and the details tied to it aren't acceptable.\n\nFollowing the Saturday meeting, a Schumer spokesman said, \"The Vice President came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we're still very far apart.\"\n\nWhich parts of the government are affected?\n\nKey parts of the federal government have been impacted by the shutdown, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the Interior Department, the State Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBut just because a federal department is subject to a lapse in funding, that doesn't mean that all of its activities immediately stop.\n\nTypically in the event of a shutdown, some federal employees deemed essential continue to work, but their pay is withheld until the shutdown is over, while other federal employees are placed on furlough, meaning they are effectively put on a leave of absence without pay. Congress can move to order that furloughed employees be paid retroactively after a shutdown is over, though that is not guaranteed.\n\nSome affected departments have put out information to explain how the shutdown will play out.\n\nThe Agriculture Department said on Twitter that \"we will be providing as many of our core services as we can using existing resources.\" A press release issued by the department specified that some of the activities that will not stop at least in the short-term include Forest Service law enforcement and emergency and natural disaster response.\n\nAn administration official told CNN prior to the shutdown began that \"a majority of DHS activities would continue\" if there were a lapse in appropriations.\n\n\"For instance, those protecting our borders with the Customs and Border Patrol will continue to do so,\" the official said.\n\nAnd despite the fact that the Justice Department will be impacted, special counsel Robert Mueller's office will be able to continue working.\n\nMueller's office \"is funded from a permanent indefinite appropriation and would be unaffected in the event of a shutdown,\" a Justice Department spokesperson told CNN previously.\n\nWill the shutdown impact holiday travel?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration will be on the job to screen passengers, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers will be directing planes.\n\nThe FAA released a statement saying that \"air traffic control is fully operational and there is no impact to safety or FAA oversight for travelers.\"\n\nAmtrak, a federally owned corporation rather than a government agency, will be open. Federal Railroad Administration inspectors will also continue to work.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection checkpoints will remain open for international travelers, and the State Department will also continue processing passports.\n\nHow many federal workers will be impacted?\n\nAn estimated 800,000 federal employees may be impacted by the partial shutdown, either by having to work during it while their pay is withheld until it ends or by being furloughed.\n\nMore than 420,000 government workers are expected to work without pay in a partial shutdown, according to a fact sheet released by the Democratic staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThat estimate includes more than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis.

They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015.

He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Japan whale hunting: Commercial whaling to restart in July", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46682976", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Japan will be free to hunt whales like the minke for commercial purposes from July onwards\n\nJapan says it is to restart commercial whaling in July in a move that is likely to draw international criticism.\n\nIt said it would withdraw from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the body tasked with whale conservation.\n\nCommercial whaling was banned by the IWC in 1986 after some species were driven almost to extinction.\n\nOfficials in Japan, an IWC member since 1951, say eating whales is part of the country's culture.\n\nFor many years Japan has hunted whales for what it calls \"scientific research\" and to sell the meat, a programme widely criticised by conservationists.\n\nWednesday's announcement had been expected, but conservation groups warn the move will have serious consequences.\n\nIt means Japan will be able to freely hunt species currently protected by the IWC, like minke whales.\n\nWhat did Japan just announce?\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshihide Suga said commercial whaling would be restricted to Japanese territorial waters and economic zones.\n\nAs a result, Japan will stop hunting in Antarctic waters and the southern hemisphere, a prospect conservation groups had welcomed before it was formally confirmed.\n\nA statement by Japan's government said the IWC was not committed enough to one of its goals, of supporting sustainable commercial whaling.\n\nIt accused the IWC of being focused only on the aim of conserving numbers.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Sushi made of whale meat and blubber sold in Miyagi prefecture\n\nA number of coastal communities in Japan have hunted whales for centuries, but consumption in the country surged only after World War Two when whales were the main source of meat.

That's driven, at least in part, by lots of visitors from overseas, hoping to take advantage of the weak pound.\n\nBut across the country as a whole there are only a few days left to make up for a miserable year.\n\nSome shops opened at 06:00 GMT, with queues of the keenest bargain-hunters having formed at 02:00.\n\nRetailers in London's West End expect to see 500,000 shoppers over the day and \u00a350m in sales.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Shoppers queued up in Princes Street, Edinburgh\n\nJace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company, representing businesses in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street, said: \"International tourists are out in force driven by the weaker pound, as well as domestic shoppers who are looking for a day out after family celebrations yesterday,\" he said.\n\nMyf Ryan, chief marketing officer for Europe at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns the Westfield shopping centres, said: \"Boxing Day is always one of our peak trading days and has got off to a very busy start.\"\n\nImage copyright Matthew Horwood Image caption Early morning queues in Cardiff stretched down Queen Street\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Customers hunted for the best bargains in Next, Edinburgh\n\nThe so-called \"Super Saturday\" before Christmas had failed to deliver the boost that retailers hoped for, with just a 1% increase in footfall.\n\nRetail analysts had been predicting bigger than usual Boxing Day discounts as shops tried to entice consumers back to the High Street.\n\nManagement consultancy Deloitte said it expected average discounts of 52% from retailers seeking to offload unwanted stock.\n\nMany stores had already begun discounting before Christmas, with the rise of Black Friday stretching the sales into November.\n\nOnline retailer Asos blamed \"unprecedented\" discounting for damaging November trading, which it said would lead to weak profit for the full year.\n\nStuart McClure, of price and discount tracking website LovetheSales.com, said that online, some retailers had kept discounts running from Black Friday right up until Christmas and increasing numbers were starting their Boxing Day sales early.\n\n\"The reductions have also been deeper.

That's more than double the number who watched this year's highest rated programme, The Queen's Christmas Broadcast.\n\nEven solid performers like Mrs Brown's Boys lost large numbers of viewers compared with 2017. The comedy is down by more than 2 million year on year.\n\nThe growing impact of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon is undoubtedly partly to blame.\n\nIt's likely that a lack of \"event programmes\" that can deliver really big in the way that shows like Only Fools & Horses did, has also contributed.\n\nBut the most significant factor is probably a very straightforward one - people's viewing habits are changing, and TV viewing on Christmas Day is becoming less important to us.\n\nOf course these overnight figures are a snapshot, and some shows will add millions more through catch-up services. So the overall picture won't be clear for another week.\n\nBut while the traditional image of families settling down to enjoy a variety of festive TV together is still an accurate one for many, for more and more people TV is no longer the automatic choice on Christmas Day.\n\nAudiences for Christmas Day have been falling in recent years and no programme has attracted more than 20 million viewers since 2001.\n\nThe single biggest Christmas Day TV audience was recorded in 1989 when 21.8 million watched the UK premiere of the film Crocodile Dundee.\n\nThe official figures do not include repeats - ruling out the late-night episode of EastEnders broadcast on Christmas Day 1986 featuring \"Dirty\" Den Watts handing divorce papers to his wife Angie.\n\nThe programme had an audience of 30 million if a repeat on 28 December is included but only 18.9 million watched it on 25 December.\n\nTop 10 most-watched programmes on Christmas Day 2018\n\n1.

It has plummeted in recent decades.\n\nAccording to Japan's Asahi newspaper, whale meat makes up only 0.1% of all meat sold in Japan.\n\nWhat's been the reaction?\n\nIn a joint statement, Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Environment Minister Melissa Price said they were \"extremely disappointed\" with Japan's decision.\n\n\"Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so-called 'scientific' whaling,\" the statement added.\n\nBefore the formal announcement was made, Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns at Humane Society International in Australia, said Japan would be \"operating completely outside the bounds of international law\".\n\nShe added: \"This is the path of a pirate whaling nation, with a troubling disregard for international rule.\"\n\nGreenpeace Japan urged the government to reconsider, and warned it would risk criticism as the host of the G20 summit in June.\n\nSam Annesley, Greenpeace Japan's executive director, said: \"It's clear that the government is trying to sneak in this announcement at the end of year, away from the spotlight of international media, but the world sees this for what it is.\n\n\"The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures.\"\n\nWhat is the current whaling ban?\n\nIn 1986, IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting to allow stocks to recover.\n\nPro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Currently, Japan kills whales under a so-called scientific research programme\n\nInstead, it became a quasi-permanent ban. Whaling nations, such as Japan, Norway and Iceland, however argue the practice is part of their culture and should continue in a sustainable way.\n\nToday, whale stocks are carefully monitored, and while many species are still endangered, others - like the minke whale that Japan primarily hunts - are not.\n\nIn September, Tokyo tried to get the IWC to allow commercial catch quotas but the proposal was rejected.\n\nCan Japan just leave?\n\nIt will still be bound by certain international laws, despite leaving the IWC.\n\nThe UN Convention on the Law of the Sea binds countries to co-operate on the conservation of whales \"through the appropriate international organisations for their conservation, management and study\". The text does not say which international organisation that is.\n\nJapan could either try to set up another international body if it manages to get enough other countries to sign up - or join an existing one like the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco) instead.\n\nLike a smaller version of the IWC, Nammco is a grouping of pro-whaling nations - Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands - born out of frustration with the IWC.\n\nHasn't Japan been whaling all along?\n\nYes, Japan has been hunting whales for the past 30 years but under a scientific programme, granted as an exception under the IWC ban.\n\nCritics say the practice is a cover for what actually amounts to commercial whaling.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan takes hundreds of whales each year\n\nIt means that whales can be taken for scientific studies and the meat can later be sold for consumption.\n\nJapan has caught between about 200 and 1,200 whales each year, saying it is investigating stock levels to see whether the whales are endangered or not.\n\nWhy can't the IWC agree?\n\nJapan has repeatedly tried to overturn the moratorium and secure agreement on sustainable catch quotas.\n\nThe last attempt to do so came in September at an IWC summit in Brazil.\n\nJapan offered a package of measures, including setting up a Sustainable Whaling Committee and sustainable catch limits \"for abundant whale stocks/species\".\n\nThe proposal was voted down.

Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely

But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the \"Ediacaran biota\" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.\n\nBut their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.\n\nIn September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish.

The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic 'berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.\n\nWorryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.\n\nOther plastic waste stories from 2018\n\nGhost particle busters\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: Blazars are powered by massive black holes\n\nNeutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.\n\nMany neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle \"ray\" straight at the Earth.\n\nThis type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.\n\nThe IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.\n\nOther astronomy stories from 2018\n\nA watery Mars - and Moon\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems Image caption The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars\n\nWe know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.\n\n\"We are not closer to actually detecting life,\" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, \"but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.\"\n\nMars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.\n\nData from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles. This ancient water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon.\n\nOther planetary science stories from 2018\n\nWhat happened to the Stonehenge builders?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Stonehenge builders were largely replaced by the Beaker people, but pockets may have lingered\n\nThe field of ancient DNA - which involves extracting and analysing genetic material from long-dead people - has provided us with unprecedented insights into the past. One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.\n\nIn a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.\n\nOther ancient DNA stories from 2018\n\nIcy impact\n\nImage copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nIn November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nThe bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.\n\nThere is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.\n\nOther earth science stories from 2018:\n\nAn earlier exodus\n\nImage copyright Israel Hershkovitz, Tel Aviv Uni Image caption The jawbone from Mislya cave in Israel dates to 185,000 years ago\n\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.\n\nIn January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.\n\nBut the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.\n\nOther human evolution stories from 2018\n\nRocks from Mars\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth\n\nAfter years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.\n\nIn April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first \"round trip\" to another planet.\n\nThe venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.\n\nUS missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.\n\nThere's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.\n\nOther space exploration stories from 2018\n\nPlastic in our water\n\nImage copyright Alice Trevail Image caption Some of the fragments are very small\n\nPlastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water.

Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.\n\nOur planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.\n\nThe number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean.

But a small, invasive wasp from China is threatening the chestnut harvest in Spain.\n\nNow government scientists are considering releasing another non-native insect into the environment to keep the wasp population under control.\n\nUnder the dense green cover of the Genal Valley in southern Spain, Julio Ruiz, a thirty-something farmer is collecting sweet chestnuts (casta\u00f1as) with his father, mother and brother.\n\nThey are picking up the prickly nuts from the leaf-strewn earth, recognising through experience those that will contain the prized, large-sized chestnut.\n\nBut this year there are far fewer chestnuts to gather not just on the Ruiz family's 30-hectare farm, but throughout the 4,000 hectares of the lush Genal Valley famed for its plentiful chestnuts thanks to its micro-climate.\n\n\"We've lost at least 30% of our usual production,\" explains Julio. \"It is all the fault of a small wasp. You can't tell there's anything wrong until the damage has been done.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption A micro-climate in the 400-hectare valley is said to contribute to its success at growing chestnuts\n\nAt the nearby co-operative collection point and weighing station talk is of little else. The chestnut gall wasp, Dryoscomus kuriphillus katsumatsu (avispilla in local Spanish), is causing huge environmental and economic damage in the Valley where the harvest accounts for 10 million euros' worth of income annually.\n\n\"We may be the biggest producers of chestnuts in Andalucia,\" says Felipe Javier Cabos Aguilar, president of the regional association of chestnut producers shaking his head sadly.\n\n\"But that just means we are the most vulnerable.\"\n\nAccording to Antonio Pulido, a forest engineer who has been overseeing the fight against the pest, the avispilla is a parasitic insect that comes from China.\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Antonio Pulido and Julio Ruiz inspecs an infected chestnut tree\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption A chestnut bud damaged by the Chinese wasp\n\n\"It's considered an exotic species that has no natural indigenous predators,\" he says.\n\n\"The main infestation is in the bud where growth is stunted. As a result the flowers and fruit cannot develop and the health and vitality of the tree is compromised. Every variety of chestnut is affected.\"\n\nOver the last three years since the infestation first arrived in the area, countless trees have died. Over the generations each plot of land, or finca, has been divided between offspring with the chestnut proving the most lucrative of all the crops.\n\nAlthough cork and other trees grow in abundance, most farmers depend on chestnuts that are exported to France for specialist processing.\n\nIn order to limit the damage, some farmers are burning the infected trees to protect those who aren't affected. \"This is increasing the risk of forest fires,\" says Antonio Pulido.\n\n\"It is also adding to urban drift as young people in the villages see their future disappearing in front of their eyes.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Here, sweet chestnuts are prepared at a local restaurant. They are also a major export\n\nCastanea sativa, called the sweet chestnut to distinguish it from the horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanus (to which it is only distantly related), offers the region unique potential.\n\nIt is already part of the trend for replacement protein for the sizeable vegan and vegetarian markets of northern Europe.\n\nNow that potential uplift for a impoverished part of a poor region of Spain is under threat.\n\nIn Malaga, at the laboratories of IFAPA-Churriana - an agriculture and fisheries investigation unit of the Andalucian Government (Junta de Andalucia), Juan-Ramon Boyero Gallardo is looking under the microscope at Torimus sinensis, the natural predator of the avispilla.\n\nIt also comes from China. He confirms that this parasitoid insect is capable of helping keep the spread of the infestation under control.\n\nThe Chinese predator has had a high rate of success in Japan, Italy and North America where the infestation appeared prior to arriving in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHowever, he remains hesitant about releasing the predator into the Genal Valley.\n\n\"The problem of introducing a further exotic species such as Torimus sinensis is that it can invade the natural woodland, attack indigenous species, displace others and alter the overall biodiversity,\" he cautions.\n\nImage copyright Gyorgy Csoka, Hungary Forest Research Institute, B Image caption The oriental chestnut gall wasp has already appeared in other regions of the world, such as North America\n\nAlthough the unforeseen repercussions might have a negative impact, there has been a limited release of a tiny number of the predator species in the Genal Valley.\n\nJuan-Ramon Boyero Gallardo says he is optimistic that Torimus sinensis and local predators will slow down the spread of the avispilla.\n\nHe views the plague (plaga in local Spanish) as just another example of the disadvantages of globalisation.\n\n\"We know that the United States have very strict controls over bringing vegetation in to the country, yet they too have been infested\" he says.\n\n\"With container-loads of produce arriving in the port of Malaga from lots of different countries around the world, there is little we can do to prevent the arrival of exotic species.\"\n\nHe goes on to comment: \"If we take a wider view this is another example of the unintentional globalisation of parasites and the problems facing scientists as they search for ways of eradicating, or at least limiting the pest,\" he says.\n\nHowever the more pressing need is to prevent the mass destruction of chestnut trees and uphold the economy of the Genal Valley - not to mention the supply of chestnut stuffing and the luxury marrons glaces so beloved at Christmas."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Sending astronauts to Mars would be stupid, astronaut says", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46364179", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Bill Anders on Apollo 8 in December 1968\n\nOne of the first men to orbit the Moon has told BBC Radio 5 Live that it's \"stupid\" to plan human missions to Mars.\n\nBill Anders, lunar module pilot of Apollo 8, the first human spaceflight to leave Earth's orbit, said sending crews to Mars was \"almost ridiculous\".\n\nNasa is currently planning new human missions to the Moon.\n\nIt wants to learn the skills and develop the technology to enable a future human landing on Mars.\n\nImage caption Bill Anders today. He says Nasa shouldn't be aiming to send manned missions to Mars\n\nAnders, 85, said he's a \"big supporter\" of the \"remarkable\" unmanned programmes, \"mainly because they're much cheaper\". But he says the public support simply isn't there to fund vastly more expensive human missions.\n\n\"What's the imperative? What's pushing us to go to Mars?\" he said, adding \"I don't think the public is that interested\".\n\nMeanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars. Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia.\n\nIn a statement, Nasa said it was \"leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars\".\n\n\"That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept.\n\nIn December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon.\n\nThe crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth.\n\nThey splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown.\n\nIt was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later.\n\nBut the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The famous Earthrise image taken from Apollo 8\n\n\"Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today. They're so ossified... Nasa has turned into a jobs programme... many of the centres are mainly interested in keeping busy and you don't see the public support other than they get the workers their pay and their congressmen get re-elected.\"\n\nAnders is also critical of the decision to focus on near-Earth orbit exploration after the completion of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. \"I think the space shuttle was a serious error. It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise,\" he said.\n\n\"The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings.\"\n\nIt's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community.\n\n\"I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Apollo 8 astronauts prepare for launch\n\nHis former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic.\n\n\"I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is,\" he told 5 Live. \"I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that.\"\n\nBut asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary.\n\n\"I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense.\"\n\nApollo's legacy\n\nReflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a \"great endeavour\" and agreed that it had won the space race.\n\nAnders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be \"Earthrise\" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: \"When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose here\u2026 it sort of dawned me,\" he said.\n\n\"And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform.

They trekked over a kilometre and a half along a muddy track on Rajabasa Mountain to a partial clearing called Kebun Damos.\n\n181225083951206\n\nThe families spent the night huddled together under trees and sleeping on banana leaves.\"It was raining hard and we were all soaked,\" said Maskah.\n\nA powerful tsunami hit Banten and Lampung provinces on Saturday night, leaving at least 430 people dead. The eruption of Anak Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait is widely thought to be the cause behind it.\n\nSome 16,000 people are now displaced, including many of the residents from Sukaraja village, who lived close to the shoreline. Most of them are afraid to go home, worried another tsunami will hit their village again.\n\nFearful of another attack\n\nThe morning after the tsunami, Maskah, 39, and other families went back to their houses to collect clothes and other personal items before returning to the safety of the mountainside.\n\nThey are fearful that Anak Krakatoa will erupt again and are too traumatised to go home. \"That sound in the distance isn't thunder,\" said Ruminah, 32, another resident of Sukaraja village.\n\n181226041508429\n\n\"It's the volcano rumbling and it's getting louder. Anak Krakatoa is still active, so we are on alert.\"\n\nFood is scarce in the makeshift camp and as of Wednesday, the residents were yet to receive adequate assistance from the government.\n\nUp to five families sleep in tents which the villagers built themselves using tarpaulins and mosquito nets.\n\n\"At night, we can't sleep,\" said Ruminah. \"We're worried about snakes and spiders. Last night, a huge millipede got inside our tent. And it's so cold.\"\n\nThe families say they need proper tents from the government, as well as blankets and cooking equipment. At the moment, they make fires from wood found in the jungle to prepare their food.\n\nWhile other local residents and charities have donated crackers, instant noodles and water, the supplies are not enough to feed the group of over 100 people at the camp.\n\nIn the meantime, the displaced families have tried to supplement their diets with food scavenged from the surrounding jungle, including unripened bananas which they boil to make edible.\n\nDifficulties in delivering aid\n\nLike other villagers, Maskah and Ruminah are critical of the government's response to the disaster. They say it is \"disappointing\" as aid is yet to reach them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jarco, a representative of Badan Amil Zakat Nasional (BAZNAS), a non-structural government organisation that reports to the president, arrived at Kebun Damos to carry out an assessment of the needs of the displaced residents.\n\n181226122540959\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that the sluggish government response was due to the logistics of getting aid to such remote areas.\n\n\"Access is difficult. We have offered the residents the chance to shelter in a local junior school building but they don't want to,\" he said, adding that he hoped tents would arrive at the camp by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, other residents have attempted to fill in this gap.\n\nHari Purnomo, a villager from neighbouring Rajabasa village, is coordinating the local response to the displaced villagers while they wait for government aid to arrive.\n\nIn addition to the camp at Kebun Damos, there are several other camps of displaced people from other villages dotted around Rajabasa Mountain.\n\nPurnomo has been collecting donations to take to the camps. He says the local government has only focused on distributing aid along the coastal areas, while areas that are further inland, have been left out.\n\nAccording to Purnomo, it has been difficult to deliver aid to a group of over 1,000 people from coastal areas in South Lampung, who have taken refuge further inland along the mountainside.\n\n\"I've tried to talk to them and ask them to come a little further down the mountain,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It's very difficult for us to help them and bring food or other supplies as there is no road here. We have to come by motorbike and then on foot.\"\n\nInland areas hard to reach\n\nLocal authorities, delivering medical aid, are also trying to overcome similar obstacles.\n\nMinak Wardan, secretary of the central health clinic in Rajabasa district, which includes Sukaraja village, says that the health authority has set up a series of mobile clinics which have driven into mountainous areas to distribute medicine.\n\n181225185002305\n\nDespite making three trips since the tsunami hit, the clinics have not been able to reach all the camps due to the difficulties in gaining access.\n\nLike Purnomo, Wardan has tried to reason with residents. \"I've already spoken to them and asked them to consider coming down, but they won't,\" he explained to Al Jazeera. \"They are traumatised.\"\n\nMaskah and Ruminah have no plans of returning to their homes in Sukaraja village. They say they will remain in the jungle until the threat of Anak Krakatoa erupting and triggering another deadly tsunami is no longer there.\n\nIndonesia's Meteorology, Geophysics and Climatology Agency head Dwikorita Karnawati has asked people to avoid coastal areas as stormy weather and high surf continue to plague the area.\n\n\"All these conditions could potentially cause landslides at the cliffs of the crater into the sea, and we fear that that could trigger a tsunami,\" she said.\n\nEleven residents from Sukaraja village are missing and presumed to be dead. The displaced residents feel that the likelihood of another eruption and tsunami is high.\n\n\"The lightning around the volcano is getting worse,\" said Maskah. \"It's cold and windy here in the jungle, but we don't want to go home.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Serena Voted AP Female Athlete of the Year for 5th Time", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/serena-voted-ap-female-athlete-of-the-year-for-5th-time/4716882.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "She showed up in Paris wearing a black catsuit, a reminder that nobody can command the Grand Slam stage quite like Serena Williams.\n\nShe reached the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, proving again how well she can play no matter how little she practices.\n\nWilliams didn\u2019t win those or any other tournaments, which in every other situation might have made for a forgettable year.\n\nIn 2018, it was a remarkable one.\n\nHer rapid return to tennis after a health scare following childbirth was a victory in itself, and for that, Williams was voted The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year for the fifth time.\n\nWilliams received 93 points in balloting by U.S. editors and news directors announced Wednesday, while gymnast Simone Biles was second with 68. Notre Dame basketball player Arike Ogunbowale was third, while Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim and swimmer Katie Ledecky, the 2017 winner, rounded out the top five.\n\nAll of those players won a title or titles in 2018, while Williams had to settle for just coming close a couple of times.\n\nNow 37 and a new mother facing some players who weren\u2019t even born when she turned pro in 1995, Williams isn\u2019t the same person who ruthlessly ran her way to 23 Grand Slam singles titles \u2014 the last of which came at the 2017 Australian Open when she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting to get to be the Serena that I was, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be that, physically, emotionally, mentally.

She returned to the WTA Tour in March and played in just a pair of events before the French Open, where she competed in a skin-tight, full-length black catsuit .\n\nShe said the outfit \u2014 worn partly for health reasons because of the clots \u2014 made her feel like a superhero, but her game was rarely in superstar shape. She had to withdraw in Paris because of a right pectoral injury and didn\u2019t play again until Wimbledon, where she lost to Angelique Kerber in the final.\n\nWilliams came up short again in New York, where her loss to Naomi Osaka in the final will be remembered best for her outburst toward chair umpire Carlos Ramos, who had penalized Williams for receiving coaching and later penalized her an entire game for calling him a \u201cthief\u201d while arguing.\n\nThat loss leaves her one major title shy of Margaret Court\u2019s record as she starts play next year in a WTA Tour that will look different in part because of new rules coming about after issues involving Williams. Players returning to the tour may use a \u201cspecial ranking\u201d for up to three years from the birth of a child, and the exemption can be used for seedings at big events. Also, the tour says players can wear leggings or compression shorts at its tournaments without a skirt over them.\n\nWilliams insists she is still driven to play and win as much if not more than before she was a mother.

We have a new foe,\" Cosette Rae says of the barrage of tech. A former developer in the tech world, she heads a Seattle area rehab center called reSTART Life, one of the few residential programs in the nation specializing in tech addiction.\n\nUse of that word \u2014 addiction \u2014 when it comes to devices, online content and the like is still debated in the mental health world. But many practitioners agree that tech use is increasingly intertwined with the problems of those seeking help.\n\nAn American Academy of Pediatrics review of worldwide research found that excessive use of video games alone is a serious problem for as many as 9 percent of young people. This summer, the World Health Organization also added \"gaming disorder\" to its list of afflictions. A similar diagnosis is being considered in the United States.\n\nIt can be a taboo subject in an industry that frequently faces criticism for using \"persuasive design,\" intentionally harnessing psychological concepts to make tech all the more enticing.\n\n\u200bOne addict's story\n\nOne 27-year-old man, found through a 12-step program for tech addicts, works in the very industry that peddles the games, videos and other online content that has long been his vice. He does cloud maintenance for a suburban Seattle tech company and constantly finds himself fending off temptation.\n\n\"I'm like an alcoholic working at a bar,\" he laments. He spoke on the condition that he not be identified, fearing he might harm his career in an industry he's long loved.\n\nAs a toddler, he sat on his dad's lap in their Seattle area home as they played simple video games on a Mac Classic II computer. By early elementary school, he got his first Super Nintendo system and spent hours playing Yoshi's Story, a game where the main character searched for \"lucky fruit.\"\n\nAs he grew, so did one of the world's major tech hubs. Led by Microsoft, it rose from the nondescript suburban landscape and farm fields here, just a short drive from the home he still shares with his mom, who split from her husband when their only child was 11.\n\nAs a teen, he took an interest in music and acting but recalls how playing games increasingly became a way to escape life. \"I go online instead of dealing with my feelings,\" he says.\n\nHe'd been seeing a therapist for depression and severe social anxiety. But attending college out of state allowed more freedom and less structure, so he spent even more time online. His grades plummeted, forcing him to change majors, from engineering to business.\n\nAfter graduating in 2016 and moving home, he'd go to a nearby restaurant or the library to use the Wi-Fi, claiming he was looking for a job but having no luck.\n\nInstead, he was spending hours on Reddit, an online forum where people share news and comments, or viewing YouTube videos. Sometimes, he watched online porn.\n\n\u200b'Detox'\n\nOthers who attend a 12-step meeting of the Internet & Tech Addiction Anonymous know the struggle.\n\n\"I had to be convinced that this was a 'thing,\"' says Walker, a 19-year-old from Washington whose parents insisted he get help after video gaming trashed his first semester of college. He agreed to speak only if identified by first name, as required by the 12-step tenets.\n\nHelp is found at facilities like reSTART. Clients \"detox\" from tech at a secluded ranch and move on to a group home.\n\nThey commit to eating well and regular sleep and exercise. They find jobs, and many eventually return to college. They also make \"bottom line\" promises to give up video games or any other problem content, as well as drugs and alcohol, if those are issues. They use monitored smartphones with limited function \u2014 calls, texts and emails and access to maps.\n\nThe young tech worker didn't go to reSTART. But he, too, has apps on his phone that send reports about what he's viewing to his 12-step sponsor, a fellow tech addict named Charlie, a 30-year-old reSTART graduate.\n\nAt home, the young man also persuaded his mom to get rid of Wi-Fi to lessen the temptation.\n\nHe still relapses every couple months, often when he's tired or upset or very bored. He tells himself that his problem isn't as bad as other tech addicts.\n\n\"Then,\" the young man says, \"I discover very quickly that I am actually an addict, and I do need to do this.\"\n\nHaving Charlie to lean on helps. \"He's a role model,\" he says.\n\n\"He has a place of his own.

That is probably unfortunate, but that shapes everything going forward,\u201d said McKee.\n\nGiven the political reset between Congress and the White House and the uncertainty of what the Russia investigation will find, what happens in 2019 could go a long way to determining whether Donald Trump is a one-term or two-term president."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump and Democrats Prepare for Reset in 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-and-democrats-prepare-for-reset-in-2019/4705272.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "The year 2018 proved to be one of change in U.S. politics.

Sue is much bulkier.\u201d\n\nThe belly ribs are not a new discovery\u2026 they\u2019ve existed since the fossil was recovered from obscurity in the rock formations of South Dakota in the early 1990s. That was the beginning of a long legal and physical journey for the world\u2019s largest Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton. Known as Sue, named for paleontologist Sue Hendrickson who discovered it, the well-preserved specimen arrived as the star attraction in Stanley Hall at the Field Museum in 2000.\n\nBut scientists only recently learned how the belly ribs fit onto the overall specimen, which now fundamentally changes what we know about the Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nAfter a nearly year-long transition to a new exhibit specifically designed for her, Sue will look different to the millions who have seen the dinosaur before.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize that Sue weighed nine tons in real life,\u201d says Hilary Hansen, project manager at the Field Museum. \u201cI think really adding this gastralia, these belly ribs, really changes the profile for Sue, and you can get a sense of how formidable and imposing it must have been to share an environment with this animal.\u201d\n\nHansen explains that the new exhibit doesn\u2019t just change our understanding of the animal itself, such as the fact it probably couldn\u2019t run, but it also show visitors Sue\u2019s natural environment, and place in history.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is bring together everything about Sue that was all over the museum into one space so our visitors can see this as a one stop shop for all things Sue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt pushes what we know about T-Rex forward,\u201d says Hoogstraten, including possible answers to how Sue met her fate.\n\n\u201cOne possibility is that there was an infection, and that she possibly starved to death.\u201d\n\nThe Field museum typically welcomes over one million visitors a year, a number Hilary Hansen expects to spike when the new Sue exhibit opens to the public just in time for the holiday rush.\n\n\u201cFor the next three weeks or so, we\u2019re expecting between seven to ten thousand visitors coming through a day.\u201d Some, revisiting an old friend with a new look.\n\nBut even though science marches on, one mystery about Sue remains.\n\nDespite the name, experts are still not sure if the dinosaur behind this fossil was male or female."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "In South Africa, HIV's Patients Survive Disease But Are Weary of Its Toll", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4713593.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "South Africa has the world's largest antiretroviral therapy program with over 4 million people receiving treatment.

He spoke on the condition that he not be identified, fearing he might harm his career in an industry he's long loved.\n\nAs a toddler, he sat on his dad's lap in their Seattle area home as they played simple video games on a Mac Classic II computer. By early elementary school, he got his first Super Nintendo system and spent hours playing Yoshi's Story, a game where the main character searched for \"lucky fruit.\"\n\nAs he grew, so did one of the world's major tech hubs. Led by Microsoft, it rose from the nondescript suburban landscape and farm fields here, just a short drive from the home he still shares with his mom, who split from her husband when their only child was 11.\n\nAs a teen, he took an interest in music and acting but recalls how playing games increasingly became a way to escape life. \"I go online instead of dealing with my feelings,\" he says.\n\nHe'd been seeing a therapist for depression and severe social anxiety. But attending college out of state allowed more freedom and less structure, so he spent even more time online. His grades plummeted, forcing him to change majors, from engineering to business.\n\nAfter graduating in 2016 and moving home, he'd go to a nearby restaurant or the library to use the Wi-Fi, claiming he was looking for a job but having no luck.\n\nInstead, he was spending hours on Reddit, an online forum where people share news and comments, or viewing YouTube videos.

He agreed to speak only if identified by first name, as required by the 12-step tenets.\n\nHelp is found at facilities like reSTART. Clients \"detox\" from tech at a secluded ranch and move on to a group home.\n\nThey commit to eating well and regular sleep and exercise. They find jobs, and many eventually return to college. They also make \"bottom line\" promises to give up video games or any other problem content, as well as drugs and alcohol, if those are issues. They use monitored smartphones with limited function \u2014 calls, texts and emails and access to maps.\n\nThe young tech worker didn't go to reSTART. But he, too, has apps on his phone that send reports about what he's viewing to his 12-step sponsor, a fellow tech addict named Charlie, a 30-year-old reSTART graduate.\n\nAt home, the young man also persuaded his mom to get rid of Wi-Fi to lessen the temptation.\n\nHe still relapses every couple months, often when he's tired or upset or very bored. He tells himself that his problem isn't as bad as other tech addicts.\n\n\"Then,\" the young man says, \"I discover very quickly that I am actually an addict, and I do need to do this.\"\n\nHaving Charlie to lean on helps. \"He's a role model,\" he says.\n\n\"He has a place of his own.

Tiralla and her husband are young farmers managing a 115-acre farm that has been in his family for nearly a century.\n\nBy April Simpson\n\nPRINCE FREDERICK, Md. \u2014 In some ways, Jamie Tiralla and her family represent farming\u2019s past and future.\n\nTiralla, 36, grew up in rural Calvert County, Maryland, but didn\u2019t know anything about farming. Her husband\u2019s family, meanwhile, has had its hobby farm for nearly a century.\n\nThey moved onto the rolling, 115-acre farm 12 years ago, immediately after celebrating their wedding reception in a barn on the property.\n\n\u201cWhen he said he wanted to move to the farm and start farming, I was wholeheartedly supportive, but I didn\u2019t have any idea what it meant,\u201d Tiralla said.\n\nAnd if the young couple hadn\u2019t had Benson Tiralla\u2019s family land, they might have chosen to do something else entirely.\n\nAccess to affordable land is a chief barrier across the country for young farmers, especially those who are new to agriculture and lack the resources and institutional knowledge of those who grew up on family farms they may inherit.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Jamie Tiralla feeds her St. Croix sheep that crowd around the container for food.\n\nYoung farmers such as Tiralla are in the minority as America\u2019s family farmers have been graying for 40 years.\n\nSince 1978, the share of principal farm operators who are 65 and older has grown, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Census of Agriculture. Meanwhile the share of younger farmers has declined.\n\nJust 4 percent of America\u2019s family farms have principal operators younger than 35, while nearly a third are led by someone age 65 or older, according to the federal government\u2019s 2012 Agricultural Resource Management Survey. The average principal farm operator in 2012 was 58 years old.\n\nFacing high farmland prices and a capital-intensive industry, farmers under the age of 40 are at a unique disadvantage in becoming the next generation of landowners.\n\nOne-tenth of America\u2019s farmland, or 91.5 million acres, is expected to have changed hands between 2015 and 2019, census of agriculture data shows. In the Northeast, Plains and West, a larger share is expected to be transferred than in other regions.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of farmland increased almost 2 percent from 2017 to 2018 to a national average of $3,140 an acre, with average prices as high as $8,080 in Iowa, $9,000 in California and $12,700 in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about significant capital expenditures before you even plant a seed,\u201d said Andrew Bahrenburg, national policy director with the National Young Farmers Coalition. The Hudson, New York-based nonprofit advocates for policy changes and connects young farmers through local chapters.\n\n\u201cPack on to that difficulty with student loan debt and lack of experience,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019ve got some significant structural barriers to getting young people in.\u201d\n\nMany young farmers are new to the agriculture industry. They didn\u2019t grow up as \u201cfarm kids,\u201d raised on family farms and among elders who passed down knowledge collected over generations. In states like Rhode Island, which has the country\u2019s most expensive farmland at $13,800 an acre, it\u2019s tough for young, landless farmers to compete.\n\nBut young farmers are helping themselves through advocacy, entrepreneurship and innovative practices. They pushed for recognition in the federal farm bill, which tends to be geared toward large-scale commodity producers.\n\nThe farm bill, which Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month, will increases funding for farmland financing and training for young farmers, the coalition said.\n\nYoung farmers also are sharing resources through their organizations and promoting agriculture education, which Tiralla, former vice president of the Calvert County Farm Bureau and former chairwoman of the Maryland Farm Bureau Young Farmers Committee, said will be a primary focus for the group\u2019s young farmers committee in 2019.\n\n\u2018Shark Tank\u2019 for ag\n\nAgriculture education can focus on more than just farming. Earlier this month, an agriculture summit drew students from Maryland high schools alongside a business-casual crowd of farmers, investors, owners of small food businesses, and state and county agriculture representatives.\n\nThe summit highlighted a range of agriculture opportunities. Tiralla, a leader in the Maryland Farm Bureau who owns the marketing company All Ag Media in addition to working the family farm, helped organize the daylong event.\n\n\u201cNo matter how good of a farmer you are, you can\u2019t be successful if you\u2019re not part of a community,\u201d Tiralla said.\n\nThe summit focused on opportunities for so-called \u201cvalue-added agriculture,\u201d which includes turning raw agricultural commodities to products with higher economic values, such as making cucumbers into pickles. The summit also included discussion about agritourism, which includes all those corn mazes and pick-your-own operations.\n\nThe summit promoted innovation through a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style pitch competition for entrepreneurs. MADTECH, a Huntington, Maryland, company that won $7,500 in the contest, operates drones that allow farmers to survey crops and monitor their land.\n\nThe company boasted that its technology provides real-time remedies to save fertilizer and relieves farmers from canvassing fields with pencil and paper in bad weather. The drone presentation was 14-year-old Jenna Seiss\u2019 favorite thing she saw at the summit.\n\n\u201cI liked how they said that it could measure the soil and if it\u2019s bad or not,\u201d said Seiss, a ninth-grader at Smithsburg High School in Smithsburg, Maryland. \u201cA lot of farmers, they don\u2019t really know the source of the problem and drones really help solve it faster.\u201d\n\nSeiss was among the six high school students brought by agriculture teacher Lee Ruark. Ruark said he knows his students won\u2019t become farmers, so he aims to instill a passion for agriculture. \u201cA lot of the kids today, they want high-tech, they want high-wage jobs,\u201d Ruark said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see agriculture as either one of those.\u201d\n\nSeiss helps on her grandfather\u2019s cattle farm but has not yet decided on a profession. She\u2019s torn between becoming a doctor and a veterinarian.\n\nAgriculture is very different than it was when Ruark, 48, grew up on his family\u2019s poultry and cattle farm in Princess Anne, Maryland. Back then, he recalled, family farms were more common.\n\nRuark left home in 1988 to study agriculture at Virginia Tech with plans to return home and manage the farm. But by the time he graduated, his parents had filed for bankruptcy. The farm was gone. He became a teacher instead.\n\nOf his six immediate neighbors who were farmers when he was growing up, only one remains on their farm, Ruark said.\n\nSeveral types of agriculture-related businesses are growing, however. Wineries, craft breweries and distilleries are examples of that trend, while younger industries such as agritourism are expected to expand, according to a study by the Business, Economic and Community Outreach Network at Salisbury University and commissioned by summit organizers Grow & Fortify.\n\n\u201cFor people who earn their living from Mother Earth, one way or the other, value-added agriculture doubles their take-home pay on the average,\u201d said the founding director of the outreach network, Memo Diriker, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s good for them and that\u2019s good for the state, because that money churns the economy.\u201d\n\nMarshal Cahall, a 29-year-old grain farmer on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, learned the importance of business diversity in agriculture as a teenager. He recalled his family losing money on its dairy farm for three consecutive years before selling their milk cows and making farming a second source of income.\n\nThe experience didn\u2019t dissuade him from entering what he described as a \u201ctradition-based business.\u201d Instead, he said he\u2019s open to different opportunities.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it: We can\u2019t all be 10,000-acre farmers,\u201d Cahall said. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding your way to be successful as a member of the agriculture community, finding a way to a successful business model, and I think that\u2019s going to be different for everyone.\u201d\n\nHelping young farmers access land\n\nCahall has benefited from one of several programs that help young farmers access land and incentivize older farmers to share their resources. He purchased a 171-acre Maryland farm through a USDA Farm Service Agency loan, often an entry point for beginning farmers.\n\nThe National Young Farmers Coalition pushed for the farm bill to increase support for the USDA Conservation Reserve Program\u2019s Transition Incentives Program. The program offers money to retired or retiring landowners who sell or rent the land to a beginning farmer or rancher or a member of a socially disadvantaged group.\n\nBahrenburg from the coalition said the group is pleased the compromise farm bill increases program funding to $50 million annually and directs up to $5 million for outreach and technical assistance for beginning farmers and eligible landowners.\n\nSome states offer their own financing programs for new farmers. In 2018, Minnesota began offering tax credits to landowners when they rent or sell farmland to beginning farmers. Nebraska and Iowa also are among states that provide landowners tax credits when they rent agricultural equipment or assets to beginning farmers. Rhode Island is starting a program to buy farms and sell them to farmers at a lower cost, although the state retains development rights.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Jamie Tiralla, her daughter, Caroline, 8, and her son Isaac, 3, feed the goats.\n\nLast year, the Maryland Agricultural and Resource-Based Industry Development Corporation, a quasi-public economic development organization known as MARBIDCO, started its Next Generation Farmland Acquisition Program with $2.5 million in state funding. Annual program funding has been renewed through 2022.\n\nSince it began, Next Gen, as the program is known, has invested nearly $3.5 million in nine purchases in six Maryland counties. The program is geared toward beginning farmers, defined as people who don\u2019t own a farm or own less than 20 acres and have limited experiences working on one. Young and beginning farmers can receive up to $500,000 for a down payment at a real estate transfer settlement.\n\nSome experts say policy makers can get creative in crafting programs to help young farmers.\n\n\u201cMy dream has always been to have a policy-supported sweat equity arrangement,\u201d said Kathleen Merrigan, executive director of the Swette Center for Sustainable Food Systems at Arizona State University. \u201cA new farmer would be coupled with an old farmer, and they would build equity in the farm through some period of years while they\u2019re learning the ropes, which would be a risk mitigation strategy for everyone involved. But we don\u2019t really have those mechanisms.\u201d\n\nFarm kids\n\nShould Tiralla\u2019s children, ages 8, 6 and 3, take over the family farm, they\u2019ll continue a long local history. Their ancestors arrived in Calvert County in the 1700s.\n\nTheir days begin in the two-story Cape Cod house that was gifted to their father\u2019s great-grandmother in 1920. The children roam freely, careful to stay a safe distance from a native azalea bush their great-grandfather planted next to the house for his mother.\n\nOn a recent morning, Tiralla got her elder children off to school, and Isaac to her in-laws, who live on a 35-acre farm next door. She fed the 60 breeding ewes and dozen goats. About 16 cows grazed in the distance.\n\nWeekends are spent helping to feed the animals and making farm rounds with their father. Isaac, 3, often runs into the middle of the herd of sheep and giggles when they scatter. Caroline, 8, and Henry, 6, do their homework at a seasonal farmers market, where the Tirallas sell the family\u2019s Monnett Farms meat products.\n\nThere\u2019s hope that one of the children will want to continue the family business, Tiralla said. But if not, their upbringing is teaching them life lessons, such as processing life and death, and how interconnected they are to their surroundings."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "These Service Members Will Work Without Paychecks During The Government Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-service-members-will-work-without-paychecks-during-the-government-shutdown_us_5c23b4a7e4b0407e907f558f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Coast Guard members who are living paycheck to paycheck may have to take out loans if the government shutdown drags on.\n\nThe Coast Guard is the only branch of the military directly affected by the partial shutdown that began Saturday because it\u2019s funded through the Department of Homeland Security.

That means they won\u2019t be working and any pay for the shutdown period would have to come retroactively, through an act of Congress.\n\nA Coast Guard spokesman said active-duty members are usually paid on the first and 15th of each month.

Although Republicans still control both the House and Senate, they don\u2019t have enough votes for a deal on wall funding without Democrats.\n\nTrump will have an even harder time rounding up votes for his wall when the new Congress takes office next week, with Democrats taking over as the House majority on Jan. 3.\n\nAn estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and roughly 380,000 have been furloughed as a quarter of the government remains closed. After previous shutdowns, Congress has passed laws to pay furloughed workers for the time they missed, and it\u2019s likely lawmakers would do the same after this one.\n\nAs HuffPost previously detailed, government shutdowns are quite expensive, forcing agencies to develop contingency plans and throwing hundreds of thousands of government employees off their normal work. The work stoppages also can damage consumer confidence in the overall economy and take a bite out of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nMany workers who are guaranteed backpay when the government reopens still must worry about how they\u2019ll cover their bills in the meantime. A woman describing herself as the wife of an active-duty Coast Guard member said on Twitter that she fears not being able to cover the family\u2019s rent. She was one of many using the #ShutdownStories hashtag:\n\nMy husband is active duty Coast Guard.

In 2013, Lystra sued her OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he had sexually harassed her.\n\nBy Barbara Feder Ostrov and Harriet Blair Rowan\n\nThe doctor instructed his patient to stand in front of him. He cupped her crotch and inserted his fingers into her vagina through her clothes, moving his hand repeatedly to her rectal area. Then he squeezed her breasts, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of California.\n\nThe patient, accompanied to the appointment by her 4-year-old granddaughter, asked why that was necessary to diagnose a urinary tract infection, according to the documents. He told her to let him do his job.\n\nIn three other cases, the board alleged that the family doctor, Ramon Fakhoury of California\u2019s Inland Empire, touched patients\u2019 genitals for no medical reason. In 2016, the board handed him 35 months of administrative probation, requiring him, among other things, to have a chaperone when treating females.\n\nFakhoury did not admit to the allegations, according to his attorney, and criminal charges against him were dropped. If he successfully completes probation next year, he\u2019ll be able to practice without restriction.\n\nWith a mission of patient protection and doctor rehabilitation \u2014 not punishment \u2014 California\u2019s medical board and those in other states make decisions under laws and norms that can seem discordant in the #MeToo era.\n\nCalifornia is often cited as one of the more rigorous states in overseeing doctors. But, according to the medical board, very few sexual misconduct complaints are reported to the board in the first place, historically under 200 a year. Even fewer result in a formal accusation against a doctor. And when discipline is found to be warranted \u2014 typically in fewer than 20 cases a year \u2014 the board tends toward leniency, sometimes granting a few years of probation even in instances of severe misconduct, according to a KHN analysis of medical board records.\n\nMore than a third of doctors sanctioned by California\u2019s board in cases that alleged sexual misconduct received probation in the past 10 years \u2014 some more than once. The terms of probation \u2014 which is not a criminal court action but places conditions on a physician\u2019s license \u2014 often required temporary chaperones, as well as psychotherapy and courses in \u201cprofessional boundaries\u201d and ethics. (Through probation, the medical board can only place conditions or restrictions on a doctor\u2019s license in civil proceedings; it does not take criminal court actions.)\n\n\u201cThey love giving second chances\u201d to physicians, said Marian Hollingsworth of San Diego, a frequent critic of the California medical board. \u201cIt makes you wonder where their priorities are \u2026 Their first loyalty is supposed to be patient safety and that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nThe recent, shocking reports about years of abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar and University of Southern California gynecologist George Tyndall \u2014 as well as national expos\u00e9s about physician misconduct by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Associated Press \u2014have only intensified concerns about whether sexual abuse is taken seriously enough in medicine.\n\nNassar, accused of abuse by scores of girls and women under the guise of medical treatment, is now serving what amounts to a life sentence. Prosecutors are considering criminal charges against Tyndall in more than 50 cases, and the state medical board has suspended his license while seeking revocation. He has denied the allegations.\n\nAnd just last week, 17 women sued Columbia University and its affiliated hospitals, alleging that the facilities engaged in covering up decades of sexual abuse by one of its OB-GYNs.\n\nResearch has shown that many doctors who sexually exploit patients, like other perpetrators of abuse, don\u2019t stop with one victim. They \u201cperpetrate such behavior for years before being stopped,\u201d said the authors of one study.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, California Gov. Jerry Brown in September signed landmark patient protection legislation requiring doctors who are on probation for sexual and other serious misconduct to notify patients of their status and the terms under which they must practice. It will take effect next July. The bill had failed twice before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said the bill\u2019s lead author, Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo). \u201cThe #Me Too movement has really made it very clear that there are individuals even in the most respected professions who abuse their authority.\u201d\n\nEven as sexual abuse complaints filed with the medical board rose significantly in the past year to coincide with the rise of #MeToo, board officials say they plan no major changes in how the board dispenses discipline in sexual misconduct cases.\n\nThe #MeToo movement \u201chas not changed us,\u201d said the board\u2019s executive director, Kimberly Kirchmeyer. Cracking down on sexual misconduct has always been \u201cone of the board\u2019s top priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nDigging into the records\n\nKHN examined all 135 cases of alleged sexual abuse investigated by the board that resulted in sanctions from July 2008 through June 2018. (The analysis did not include discipline based on proceedings in other states.)\n\nMore than a third of sanctions were for sexual misconduct with more than one victim, and the vast majority of alleged perpetrators were men accused of exploiting women.\n\nDoctors\u2019 licenses were revoked in 39 cases and voluntarily surrendered in 38. Several doctors received public reprimands \u2014 a minor sanction.\n\nThe largest share of sanctions \u2014 49 cases, or more than a third \u2014 were for probation.\n\nAccording to the board\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, the minimum probation period is seven years for a doctor found to have engaged in sexual misconduct \u2014 whether it is a sexual relationship with a patient, sexualized touching during exams or inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nBut those \u201cminimums\u201d were not applied in more than half of the probation cases, according to the KHN analysis. The guidelines allow exceptions based on \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d the age of cases, the quality of evidence and other factors.\n\nKirchmeyer noted that the board treats every case as unique and places a high value on a doctor\u2019s remorse and acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nIn eight cases, KHN found, a doctor sanctioned for sexual misconduct had previously been sanctioned for similar misconduct.\n\nDr. Patrick Mark Sutton, a Pasadena obstetrician-gynecologist, received probation twice \u2014 the first time for four years after investigators alleged sexual misconduct in 2002. In 2011, he was placed on probation again \u2014 this time for three years \u2014 following allegations that he improperly rubbed a patient\u2019s thigh and engaged in inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nHe denied all sexual misconduct allegations in 2002 and 2011, admitting only to medical record-keeping violations in both cases.\n\nThis September, after he had completed mandated ethics and \u201cboundaries\u201d courses, the medical board filed a new accusation against Sutton, saying that he had called a patient \u201chairy\u201d and asked the patient, who was naked from the waist down under a drape and in stirrups exposing her genitals: \u201cDo you enjoy orgasms? You are a very beautiful woman,\u201d according to the documents. That case is pending.\n\nSutton\u2019s lawyer, Gary Wittenberg, said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe allegations in the pending accusation are untrue and we will prove that in court.\u201d\n\nIn several cases, the board granted probation knowing the doctor had been convicted of misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse investigations.\n\nFakhoury, the Inland Empire doctor, had faced felony sexual abuse-related charges but was not convicted due to a hung jury, according to San Bernardino County Superior Court records.\n\nHis lawyer, Courtney Pilchman, told Kaiser Health News that the criminal charges were dismissed afterward and that the doctor \u201cdid not stipulate\u201d to \u2014 or admit to \u2014 the medical board accusation.\n\nBy contrast, Ohio\u2019s medical board, upon learning of California\u2019s sanction, in 2012 revoked his state license.\n\nThe number of disciplinary actions taken over the decade is strikingly small given the size of California\u2019s practicing physician population of more than 100,000. Alleged victims of sexual abuse by physicians are significantly less likely to come forward than sexual abuse victims in general, some research indicates.\n\nHowever, numbers provided by the medical board suggest that many of the complaints that are filed \u2014 whether by victims themselves or other sources \u2014 do not result in formal accusations against doctors. From October 2013 through June 2018, 838 complaints were designated by the board as possible sexual misconduct. During that same period, 74 accusations were filed. (Multiple complaints could be filed about one doctor.)\n\nExperts and lawyers familiar with the board offered various explanations: Some complaints may be false. Doctor sexual misconduct can be hard to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as required in medical board cases. Accused physicians often hire experienced lawyers who aggressively fight back, leading to delays and deals. Victims may decline to testify or present poorly as witnesses.\n\nSome victims, for instance, have psychiatric disorders or believe that they were engaging in a \u201cconsensual\u201d relationship, according to medical board documents.\n\nBoard staff have worked hard to treat alleged victims sensitively, Kirchmeyer said. Expert reviewers are instructed to read complaints as if the person is telling the truth, she said, and the board plans weeklong training sessions to help investigators work better with alleged victims and prepare them for testifying.\n\nThe cases often drag on. It can take years for victims to come forward in the first place \u2014 and more time for cases to wind their way through the state\u2019s complex bureaucracy. Evidence can go stale.\n\n\u201cPhysicians have to have due process,\u201d Kirchmeyer said. \u201cAnyone can make a complaint about anyone at any time.\u201d\n\nHeidi de Marco/KHN Tracy Lystra at her home in Aguanga, Calif.\n\n\u2018Slap in my face\u2019\n\nFacing what they see as an uphill battle, lawyers from the state Department of Justice, who handle administrative hearings, will sometimes pre-emptively recommend probation \u2014 even in serious sexual misconduct accusations \u2014 to avoid the possibility a doctor will get no sanction at all from a judge, said Laura Sweet, a former deputy director who retired in 2015.\n\nSweet, who worked for the medical board for 23 years, said the legal process focuses on the doctors and does not always give sufficient weight to the pain of alleged victims. \u201cYou\u2019re sending a message that\u2019s potentially minimizing what the victim endured.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Tracy Lystra sees it, too. In 2013, Lystra sued her Fallbrook, California OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he harassed her with comments about her body and how she aroused him, whispering into her ear as she lay on a gurney before surgery that she looked like a \u201csexy librarian.\u201d She said the case, which also alleged medical negligence, was settled for $150,000 in 2016. Bianchi, who could not be reached for comment, denied the allegations in court documents.\n\nThrough her attorney, Lystra filed a complaint to the medical board shortly after settling with Bianchi. This past July, she received a letter from the board saying it would not be able \u201cestablish grounds for discipline\u201d against Bianchi in her case, \u201cconsidering all the evidence and mitigating factors.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she learned that the board had received complaints from other women.\n\nIn 2014, Bianchi had been put on five years\u2019 probation after the board accused him of making inappropriate sexual remarks to two patients, telling one he dreamed of having oral sex with her and couldn\u2019t stop staring at her breasts. After learning of these cases, another woman came forward, alleging Bianchi several years earlier had blocked his office door with a chair, inserted his fingers into her vagina, exposed his penis and asked her for sex.\n\nThe board\u2019s penalty was another five years\u2019 probation. But the two probation terms overlap \u2014 and Bianchi, who agreed not to contest the allegations as part of the settlements in each case, could go back to work as an OB-GYN without restrictions in 2021. In the meantime, he is not allowed to treat female patients.\n\nLearning that Bianchi received such a light punishment \u2014 and that the board would not take action on her own complaint \u2014 was crushing, Lystra said, noting that it had been so difficult to get anyone, including her family, to believe her.\n\n\u201cI really wanted him stopped. It was so disappointing when medical board responded the way it did,\u201d Lystra said.\u201cIt was a slap in my face.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nIn its analysis, KHN requested every sanction for sexual misconduct issued by the Medical Board of California over the past 10 years, the name of each doctor involved and his or her license number. The board responded with 181 actions against 175 doctors from fiscal year 2008-09, beginning in July, through fiscal year 2017-2018, ending in June. (The records were designated by the board as primarily for sexual misconduct but often included other allegations.)\n\nKHN used the board\u2019s document lookup search on its website to review its available public records on each doctor. KHN mentioned sanctions outside the 10-year period when records showed the doctors were repeat offenders.\n\nThe analysis excluded cases in which the board took action in response to sanctions issued by other states\u2019 medical boards for sexual misconduct outside California.\n\nFor each sanction, KHN determined the number of alleged victims identified in the board\u2019s accusations, their gender, type of sanction, length and terms of probation, type of alleged sexual misconduct and whether the board took note of any previous or concurrent criminal proceedings.\n\nKHN also requested the number of complaints the board received alleging sexual misconduct, and how many formal accusations the board filed each year after the allegations were investigated and merited disciplinary action. The board did not have data for all 10 years, but provided the number of complaints received and the number of accusations filed from October 2013 through the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Don Jr. Mocked With Birthday Party Starring Alleged Ex", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr_us_5c233c3be4b0407e907ec24b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler magazine and tireless troll of President Donald Trump, has taken his obsession to new heights, hosting a party for Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s 41st birthday where the star guest will be his alleged ex-girlfriend.\n\nFlynt, who once vowed to give $10 million to anyone offering enough dirt on the president to get him impeached, will throw the soir\u00e9e at his Las Vegas club on New Year\u2019s Eve, where Aubrey O\u2019Day, formerly of pop group Danity Kane, will perform.\n\nThe venue\u2019s website displays a promotional poster for the event, featuring O\u2019Day in a lacy black leotard and noting she\u2019ll be singing three songs on stage with a meet and greet to follow.\n\nHowever, it seems Flynt might already have a hunch Donnie will be a no-show.\n\nSpeaking to The New York Post\u2019s Page Six, Flynt\u2019s spokesman David Bryant admitted: \u201cLarry cannot stand Donald.

And there is no end in sight.\n\nSo far, the public and federal workers have largely been spared inconvenience and hardship because government is closed on weekends and federal employees were excused from work on Christmas Eve and Christmas, a federal holiday. The shutdown began at midnight last Friday.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the closed parts of the government will remain that way until Democrats agree to wall off the U.S.-Mexico border to deter criminal elements. He said he\u2019s open to calling the wall something else as long as he ends up with an actual wall.\n\nAsked when the government would reopen fully, Trump said he couldn\u2019t say.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you when the government\u2019s going to be open. I can tell you it\u2019s not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they\u2019d like to call it,\u201d Trump said, referring to Democrats who staunchly oppose walling off the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call it whatever they want, but it\u2019s all the same thing,\u201d he told reporters after participating in a holiday video conference with representatives from all five branches of the military stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.\n\nTrump argued that drug flows and human trafficking can only be stopped by a wall.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do it without a barrier. We can\u2019t do it without a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to do it is to have a physical barrier, meaning a wall. And if you don\u2019t have that then we\u2019re just not opening\u201d the government.\n\nDemocrats oppose spending money on a wall, preferring instead to pump the dollars into fencing, technology and other means of controlling access to the border. Trump argued that Democrats oppose a wall only because he is for one.\n\nThe stalemate over how much to spend and how to spend it caused the partial government shutdown that began Saturday following a lapse in funding for departments and agencies that make up about 25 percent of the government.\n\nSome 800,000 government workers are affected. Many are on the job but must wait until after the shutdown to be paid again.\n\nTrump claimed that many of these workers \u201chave said to me and communicated, \u2018stay out until you get the funding for the wall.\u2019 These federal workers want the wall. The only one that doesn\u2019t want the wall are the Democrats.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t say how he\u2019s hearing from federal workers, excluding those he appointed to their jobs or who work with him in the White House. But many rank-and-file workers have gone to social media with stories of the financial hardship they expect to face because of the shutdown.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "You Can\u2019t Understand The Brutal Reality Of Gun Violence Until You Hear It From Doctors", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-gun-violence-this-is-our-lane_us_5c1c1203e4b08aaf7a86a67b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "Christmas Eve, for Dr. Mary Brandt, will forever be associated with saving the life of a little girl who nearly died from a gunshot more than 25 years ago.\n\nTeams were in the middle of changing shifts when a 6-year-old came to a Texas county hospital ER with massive gunshot wounds to her shoulder and chest. Her mother had been fatally shot by her boyfriend. When the girl tried to call 911, the man turned his shotgun on her.\n\nAfter hours of surgery, Brandt saved the child. Since then, Brandt, now a pediatric surgeon at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston, has operated on many more child shooting victims. \u201cAll of us have some patients who we can\u2019t forget,\u201d Brandt said of the young girl. \u201cIn terms of being able to not be sad about it, it took months and months. I\u2019m still probably a little sad about it.\u201d\n\nFew people in the world are more familiar with gun violence than emergency room doctors and surgeons like Brandt. But until recently they\u2019ve largely kept quiet about their experiences on the front line of this public health crisis.\n\nThat changed in November after the American College of Physicians issued new guidelines on how doctors can help protect patients from gun violence \u2015 and the National Rifle Association responded by telling physicians to \u201cstay in your lane.\u201d\n\nIn effect, the NRA wanted these doctors to shut up about an issue that touches their lives daily, leading to a record high of nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and around twice as many injuries each year.\n\nThe NRA retort was enough to lead many physicians to break their silence. Under the banner of \u201cThis is our lane,\u201d surgeons and other doctors thrust themselves into the gun debate, sharing photos from inside operating rooms and telling stories about the agony of treating an unending flow of shooting victims.\n\nMedical organizations also doubled down, calling for additional gun violence research and further pushing measures like universal background checks, waiting periods to buy guns, safe storage initiatives and so-called red flag laws designed to keep firearms away from people who may be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nNow, in a series of interviews with HuffPost, doctors are shedding additional light on the topic, painting a diverse portrait of a problem that afflicts communities in a variety of forms, including mass shootings, assaults, accidents, intimate partner violence and suicide.\n\nTheir accounts describe exhausting work that doctors have traditionally shouldered in private. Many doctors told HuffPost they feel it\u2019s their moral duty to show the public the truth: Gun violence is ubiquitous in emergency rooms all over the country.\n\nExposing people to that reality could resonate in a way that general facts and figures about gun violence haven\u2019t and show Americans that it\u2019s necessary to begin taking steps to address the crisis, Brandt said.\n\n\u201cHuman beings don\u2019t just change their minds because of data.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something I wish I could do something about, but I feel helpless. Dr. Adam Schechner, University of Maryland Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center\n\nWhen doctors see patients with gunshot wounds on a daily basis, it\u2019s hard to keep track of how many they\u2019ve treated.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew. Too many,\u201d said Dr. Adam Schechner, a trauma surgeon at the University of Maryland Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center in Cheverly.\n\nSchechner estimates he\u2019s tended to hundreds of shooting victims, the majority of them young men from Washington and the Maryland suburb of Prince George\u2019s County. Schechner recalled a case in which a young man died of his injuries. When Schechner informed the patient\u2019s mother, she broke down. The woman gathered herself long enough to explain that the son she\u2019d lost was the only family she had left. Her other son had been shot and killed a few years prior. She was alone.\n\n\u201cThat one really, really got to me,\u201d Schechner said.\n\nEven when his patients survive, it can feel as if he\u2019s working against a tide that will ultimately erase his work, Schechner said. Many of the gunshot victims that come into the hospital have been shot before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening because most of the time it seems like they just don\u2019t care, [like] they don\u2019t seem to appreciate the second chance they\u2019ve been given,\u201d Schechner said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the hardest part of my job: working to save somebody\u2019s life and then having them not appreciate that life.\u201d\n\nLast year, the hospital Schechner works at launched a program to help survivors who\u2019ve been shot or stabbed multiple times, providing wraparound care and social services designed to target the root causes of violence. The evidence so far suggests it\u2019s working.\n\nThe program is a critical step toward prevention, but it\u2019s hardly a catchall solution to gun violence, Schechner said. The more shooting victims he treats, the more he realizes this issue affects him not just as a doctor but also as the father of young children, who he fears he could someday find on an operating table with a gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cIt makes my life outside the hospital that much sadder, because it\u2019s something I wish I could do something about, but I feel helpless,\u201d Schechner said.\n\nIt was like a scene from hell. Dr. John Fildes, University Medical Center of Southern Nevada\n\nEven two decades as a trauma surgeon couldn\u2019t truly prepare Dr. John Fildes for the terror he encountered on Oct. 1, 2017.\n\nFildes began his shift at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas just minutes after the gunfire stopped at the Route 91 music festival, the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. There were already 35 people with gunshot wounds waiting in the trauma area, he said.\n\n\u201cThere was blood all over the floors and the gurneys, and there were patients that were holding pressure on their own wounds telling me to take care of the sicker patients,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cIt was like a scene from hell.\u201d\n\nFildes and his colleagues scrambled to get the most severely injured patients into the operating room and worked to stabilize the others. Most of the team managed to work through the paralyzing horror of the moment, though a handful of staffers were so emotionally jarred that they had to be briefly pulled away to compose themselves, Fildes said.\n\nDespite the circumstances, Fildes and the surgery department he chairs saved every one of the 104 patients connected to the shooting who arrived at the hospital alive.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Mourners gather at a makeshift memorial after the Route 91 shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nAny sense of triumph was short-lived, Fildes said. He still struggles to find words to describe what transpired that night.\n\n\u201cThis was 1,100 rounds of military-grade ammunition showered on 22,000 people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another one of these cases.\u201d\n\nAlthough the medical center began interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder the next day, in the year since the shooting, staffers have reported sleeplessness and repeated nightmares, Fildes said. A handful have required more serious care.\n\nThe Route 91 Harvest festival shooting was a horrific outlier, and Fildes said he hopes no surgeon will have to witness another massacre of this scale. But even doctors lucky enough to avoid mass shootings can\u2019t escape the constant drumbeat of more ordinary firearm injuries and deaths, he said. For many, that bloodshed is reason enough to speak out on gun violence.\n\n\u201cDoctors don\u2019t have a gun problem; they have a bullet hole problem,\u201d Fildes said, adding that a renewed focus on firearm safety, prevention and enforcing existing gun laws would go a long way toward saving lives.\n\nThere\u2019s only one degree of separation between you and everybody else. Dr. Christopher Barsotti, Berkshire Medical Center and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center\n\nWhen Dr. Christopher Barsotti, an emergency physician, moved to southern Vermont from a busy Chicago hospital known for treating shooting victims, he hoped he\u2019d be leaving gun violence behind. Instead, it became more personal.\n\nBarsotti sometimes recognizes patients he treats in the emergency room, or has at least met their family members or neighbors, he said. That can make cases even harder as he learns about the often tragic circumstances that precede shootings.\n\nBeyond self-inflicted gunshot wounds and instances of people \u201csettling scores,\u201d rural hospitals see plenty of hunting accidents, domestic violence or shootings involving children who\u2019ve accessed unsecured firearms, said Barsotti, who is a gun owner himself. In the worst cases, it may fall to Barsotti to deliver bad news to a person he knows.\n\n\u201cWhen you live out here, there\u2019s like 2 degrees separation between you and everybody else,\u201d Barsotti said. \u201cWhen you are actually working and taking care of people, there\u2019s only 1 degree of separation.\u201d\n\nSometimes the unthinkable happens. Dr. Richard Miskimins, a trauma surgeon at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, recalled operating on a patient who\u2019d been shot in the face. Hours later, he found out he knew the man.\n\n\u201cHe was so horribly disfigured that I didn\u2019t realize,\u201d Miskimins said.\n\nAlbuquerque is hardly a rural town, but as home to the state\u2019s only Level I trauma center, Miskimins and his colleagues treat a number of patients transferred from smaller counties in the state. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds are particularly common, Miskimins said. Although the vast majority of people who attempt to kill themselves with a firearm will die, those who don\u2019t are typically left with debilitating neurological or physical injuries that require intensive care.\n\nA few years ago, Miskimins treated a patient who\u2019d intentionally shot himself. After completing a lengthy recovery, including a facial reconstruction, the young man began visiting the ICU regularly to thank the staff, said Miskimins. The patient has since gotten involved in national suicide prevention efforts.\n\n\u201cSuicide is so often just an impulsive thing, where, in the depths of despair, they act,\u201d he said, citing studies showing that many people who survive suicide attempts don\u2019t go on to try again. When a gun is available, those impulses are far more likely to end in death.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the person who sustains the injury. Dr. Richard Miskimins, University of New Mexico Hospital\n\nGun violence isn\u2019t just a story of victims and perpetrators, Miskimins said. Whether fatal or not, every shooting ripples outward, touching not only the individuals directly involved but also their families, friends and loved ones, as well as the medical professionals who serve as intermediaries during these painful ordeals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the person who sustains the injury that has a significant psychological impact on them; it\u2019s also on their family that comes and sees them,\u201d Miskimins said.\n\nAs challenging as it can be for everyone to recover after a shooting, it pales in comparison to the alternative. Telling a parent that their child has been fatally shot never gets easier, said Dr. Mark Seamon, a trauma surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine. He said he changes into clean scrubs and takes a few deep breaths before giving the news.\n\n\u201cYou never know what their reaction will be,\u201d Seamon said. \u201cI\u2019ve had reactions where the mother would say, \u2018Well, we knew this was coming,\u2019 and just walk out.\u201d\n\nSo, a lot of folks have asked me about this photo: the chair. Why? Well, I have a chair for all the things I ROUTINELY do: my dinner chair, my reading chair, the chair where I rock my kids to sleep. And the chair where I tell parents their kids are dead. #ThisisOurLane pic.twitter.com/MNDutybXwC \u2014 Stephanie Bonne (@scrubbedin) November 17, 2018\n\nEven when a family fears the worst, they\u2019re never really prepared for it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain tenor, there\u2019s a certain pitch to their voices or the cry that they give when you tell them that their loved one has died,\u201d Barsotti said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound that hits you in the pit of your stomach.\u201d\n\nThe day you don\u2019t cry is the day you should quit. Dr. Mary Brandt, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nThe emotional burden of gun violence weighed heavily on the mind of every doctor HuffPost spoke with. When asked how they deal with it, there was less agreement.\n\nSome emergency rooms do their best to address grief in real time. When someone dies in the trauma bay at the University of New Mexico Hospital, they\u2019ll hold a brief moment of silence to reflect on the loss and acknowledge the staff, said Dr. Stephen Lu, a trauma surgeon.\n\n\u201cIt takes like 30 seconds, then we go on with the rest of the night,\u201d Lu said.\n\nTo handle the stress of a life-or-death job in the operating room, many doctors said they must be able to compartmentalize. For some, that may mean simply trying to bury the brutal reality of what they\u2019ve witnessed.\n\nSchechner, the doctor from Maryland, rarely talks about how his job affects him personally, he said, noting that surgeons are generally wary of showing any sign of weakness related to their work.\n\n\u201cEvery person that I pronounce dead from a gunshot wound takes a little piece of me,\u201d Schechner said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019re human, too, and we\u2019re not supposed to act like it.\u201d\n\nDespite perceptions of physicians as being unshakable, or even stolid, those qualities are just one part of the job, said Brandt, the pediatric surgeon from Texas. The other half involves being human. In the operating room, surgeons must focus on saving lives. \u201cAfterwards, we allow it to hit us,\u201d Brandt explained. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve always felt, and I have taught, is the day you don\u2019t cry is the day you should quit.\u201d\n\nTo the @NRA, this is what it looks like to stay in #mylane. We will not be silent about the toll of #gunviolence. I speak out for this patient, for their parents who will never be the same, for every person who came after this one and didn\u2019t have to #thisiseveryoneslane pic.twitter.com/B5mo6pC4dV \u2014 Kristin Gee, MD (@kmgee9) November 10, 2018\n\nDoctors manage these emotions with varying degrees of success. Traditionally, the medical profession has viewed self-care as selfish, maintaining that a physician\u2019s own needs are secondary to the patient\u2019s, said Dr. Jo Shapiro, director of the Center for Professionalism and Peer Support at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter three decades of practicing surgery, Shapiro was struck by the lack of attention paid to the people doing the work. It eventually became clear that physicians couldn\u2019t continue putting themselves last. Studies have shown that burnout, depression and other mental health problems plague the health care profession. And the doctors HuffPost spoke to were quick to note that the cascading effects of gun violence don\u2019t stop at physicians. They can touch everyone from nurses, to hospital support staff, to the custodians who clean blood off the floor of the ER.\n\nShapiro now directs a program that trains physicians how to support each other when they experience trauma on the job, whether it\u2019s an acute response to a particular case or the cumulative weight of unceasing gun violence.\n\n\u201cSomebody has to be there to help patients who have been shot, but it\u2019s very frustrating, saddening [and] hard to do over and over again,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt can be demoralizing.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019ve had someone die in your hands, that\u2019s easy to say. Dr. Stephen Lu, University of New Mexico Hospital\n\nSome doctors see the \u201cThis is our lane\u201d movement as an outlet not only to begin processing their grief but also to channel it toward solutions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such joy in thinking I\u2019m not just treating the end result, I\u2019m helping prevent this,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201d[It\u2019s] letting us bring our humanity back into our work.\u201d\n\nThis focus on prevention is also well-trod in the field of medicine, with doctors using similar methods to tackle past public health crises, such as HIV, smoking, motor vehicle deaths or environmental hazards and pollution. First, they study a problem to identify its patterns and root causes. Then they work to design policies in an effort to reduce those negative effects, rather than just treat them as they arise.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of firearm deaths and injuries, the political polarization has made many doctors hesitant to speak up, said Lu, the New Mexico trauma surgeon. By not speaking out, he said, doctors may have unintentionally sanitized the shootings that rip through American streets, homes, schools and ultimately hospitals tens of thousands of times each year.\n\n\u201cAmericans are shielded from death in general,\u201d Lu said, adding that it\u2019s one reason for the lack of compassion and empathy in the gun debate.\n\nYet it\u2019s people who lack this exposure, who likely have never seen a gunshot up close and hopefully never will, who are now telling doctors that gun violence is none of their business."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Mike Huckabee On Backlash To Trump's Santa Call: He Didn't Boil The Girl\u2019s Bunny", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-huckabee-trump-santa-boil-bunny_us_5c23961ae4b08aaf7a8d0538", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "Mike Huckabee made an unexpected comparison to the movie \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d Wednesday while weighing in on the media response to President Donald Trump\u2019s Christmas call with a 7-year-old girl where he questioned her belief in Santa Claus.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with people?\u201d the former Arkansas governor said on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d telling the hosts that Trump \u201ccan\u2019t catch a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he was boiling the little girl\u2019s bunny rabbit in a pot on the stove or something.

In 2013, Lystra sued her OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he had sexually harassed her.\n\nBy Barbara Feder Ostrov and Harriet Blair Rowan\n\nThe doctor instructed his patient to stand in front of him. He cupped her crotch and inserted his fingers into her vagina through her clothes, moving his hand repeatedly to her rectal area. Then he squeezed her breasts, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of California.\n\nThe patient, accompanied to the appointment by her 4-year-old granddaughter, asked why that was necessary to diagnose a urinary tract infection, according to the documents. He told her to let him do his job.\n\nIn three other cases, the board alleged that the family doctor, Ramon Fakhoury of California\u2019s Inland Empire, touched patients\u2019 genitals for no medical reason. In 2016, the board handed him 35 months of administrative probation, requiring him, among other things, to have a chaperone when treating females.\n\nFakhoury did not admit to the allegations, according to his attorney, and criminal charges against him were dropped. If he successfully completes probation next year, he\u2019ll be able to practice without restriction.\n\nWith a mission of patient protection and doctor rehabilitation \u2014 not punishment \u2014 California\u2019s medical board and those in other states make decisions under laws and norms that can seem discordant in the #MeToo era.\n\nCalifornia is often cited as one of the more rigorous states in overseeing doctors. But, according to the medical board, very few sexual misconduct complaints are reported to the board in the first place, historically under 200 a year. Even fewer result in a formal accusation against a doctor. And when discipline is found to be warranted \u2014 typically in fewer than 20 cases a year \u2014 the board tends toward leniency, sometimes granting a few years of probation even in instances of severe misconduct, according to a KHN analysis of medical board records.\n\nMore than a third of doctors sanctioned by California\u2019s board in cases that alleged sexual misconduct received probation in the past 10 years \u2014 some more than once. The terms of probation \u2014 which is not a criminal court action but places conditions on a physician\u2019s license \u2014 often required temporary chaperones, as well as psychotherapy and courses in \u201cprofessional boundaries\u201d and ethics. (Through probation, the medical board can only place conditions or restrictions on a doctor\u2019s license in civil proceedings; it does not take criminal court actions.)\n\n\u201cThey love giving second chances\u201d to physicians, said Marian Hollingsworth of San Diego, a frequent critic of the California medical board. \u201cIt makes you wonder where their priorities are \u2026 Their first loyalty is supposed to be patient safety and that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nThe recent, shocking reports about years of abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar and University of Southern California gynecologist George Tyndall \u2014 as well as national expos\u00e9s about physician misconduct by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Associated Press \u2014have only intensified concerns about whether sexual abuse is taken seriously enough in medicine.\n\nNassar, accused of abuse by scores of girls and women under the guise of medical treatment, is now serving what amounts to a life sentence. Prosecutors are considering criminal charges against Tyndall in more than 50 cases, and the state medical board has suspended his license while seeking revocation. He has denied the allegations.\n\nAnd just last week, 17 women sued Columbia University and its affiliated hospitals, alleging that the facilities engaged in covering up decades of sexual abuse by one of its OB-GYNs.\n\nResearch has shown that many doctors who sexually exploit patients, like other perpetrators of abuse, don\u2019t stop with one victim. They \u201cperpetrate such behavior for years before being stopped,\u201d said the authors of one study.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, California Gov. Jerry Brown in September signed landmark patient protection legislation requiring doctors who are on probation for sexual and other serious misconduct to notify patients of their status and the terms under which they must practice. It will take effect next July. The bill had failed twice before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said the bill\u2019s lead author, Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo). \u201cThe #Me Too movement has really made it very clear that there are individuals even in the most respected professions who abuse their authority.\u201d\n\nEven as sexual abuse complaints filed with the medical board rose significantly in the past year to coincide with the rise of #MeToo, board officials say they plan no major changes in how the board dispenses discipline in sexual misconduct cases.\n\nThe #MeToo movement \u201chas not changed us,\u201d said the board\u2019s executive director, Kimberly Kirchmeyer. Cracking down on sexual misconduct has always been \u201cone of the board\u2019s top priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nDigging into the records\n\nKHN examined all 135 cases of alleged sexual abuse investigated by the board that resulted in sanctions from July 2008 through June 2018. (The analysis did not include discipline based on proceedings in other states.)\n\nMore than a third of sanctions were for sexual misconduct with more than one victim, and the vast majority of alleged perpetrators were men accused of exploiting women.\n\nDoctors\u2019 licenses were revoked in 39 cases and voluntarily surrendered in 38. Several doctors received public reprimands \u2014 a minor sanction.\n\nThe largest share of sanctions \u2014 49 cases, or more than a third \u2014 were for probation.\n\nAccording to the board\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, the minimum probation period is seven years for a doctor found to have engaged in sexual misconduct \u2014 whether it is a sexual relationship with a patient, sexualized touching during exams or inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nBut those \u201cminimums\u201d were not applied in more than half of the probation cases, according to the KHN analysis. The guidelines allow exceptions based on \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d the age of cases, the quality of evidence and other factors.\n\nKirchmeyer noted that the board treats every case as unique and places a high value on a doctor\u2019s remorse and acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nIn eight cases, KHN found, a doctor sanctioned for sexual misconduct had previously been sanctioned for similar misconduct.\n\nDr. Patrick Mark Sutton, a Pasadena obstetrician-gynecologist, received probation twice \u2014 the first time for four years after investigators alleged sexual misconduct in 2002. In 2011, he was placed on probation again \u2014 this time for three years \u2014 following allegations that he improperly rubbed a patient\u2019s thigh and engaged in inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nHe denied all sexual misconduct allegations in 2002 and 2011, admitting only to medical record-keeping violations in both cases.\n\nThis September, after he had completed mandated ethics and \u201cboundaries\u201d courses, the medical board filed a new accusation against Sutton, saying that he had called a patient \u201chairy\u201d and asked the patient, who was naked from the waist down under a drape and in stirrups exposing her genitals: \u201cDo you enjoy orgasms? You are a very beautiful woman,\u201d according to the documents. That case is pending.\n\nSutton\u2019s lawyer, Gary Wittenberg, said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe allegations in the pending accusation are untrue and we will prove that in court.\u201d\n\nIn several cases, the board granted probation knowing the doctor had been convicted of misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse investigations.\n\nFakhoury, the Inland Empire doctor, had faced felony sexual abuse-related charges but was not convicted due to a hung jury, according to San Bernardino County Superior Court records.\n\nHis lawyer, Courtney Pilchman, told Kaiser Health News that the criminal charges were dismissed afterward and that the doctor \u201cdid not stipulate\u201d to \u2014 or admit to \u2014 the medical board accusation.\n\nBy contrast, Ohio\u2019s medical board, upon learning of California\u2019s sanction, in 2012 revoked his state license.\n\nThe number of disciplinary actions taken over the decade is strikingly small given the size of California\u2019s practicing physician population of more than 100,000. Alleged victims of sexual abuse by physicians are significantly less likely to come forward than sexual abuse victims in general, some research indicates.\n\nHowever, numbers provided by the medical board suggest that many of the complaints that are filed \u2014 whether by victims themselves or other sources \u2014 do not result in formal accusations against doctors. From October 2013 through June 2018, 838 complaints were designated by the board as possible sexual misconduct. During that same period, 74 accusations were filed. (Multiple complaints could be filed about one doctor.)\n\nExperts and lawyers familiar with the board offered various explanations: Some complaints may be false. Doctor sexual misconduct can be hard to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as required in medical board cases. Accused physicians often hire experienced lawyers who aggressively fight back, leading to delays and deals. Victims may decline to testify or present poorly as witnesses.\n\nSome victims, for instance, have psychiatric disorders or believe that they were engaging in a \u201cconsensual\u201d relationship, according to medical board documents.\n\nBoard staff have worked hard to treat alleged victims sensitively, Kirchmeyer said. Expert reviewers are instructed to read complaints as if the person is telling the truth, she said, and the board plans weeklong training sessions to help investigators work better with alleged victims and prepare them for testifying.\n\nThe cases often drag on. It can take years for victims to come forward in the first place \u2014 and more time for cases to wind their way through the state\u2019s complex bureaucracy. Evidence can go stale.\n\n\u201cPhysicians have to have due process,\u201d Kirchmeyer said. \u201cAnyone can make a complaint about anyone at any time.\u201d\n\nHeidi de Marco/KHN Tracy Lystra at her home in Aguanga, Calif.\n\n\u2018Slap in my face\u2019\n\nFacing what they see as an uphill battle, lawyers from the state Department of Justice, who handle administrative hearings, will sometimes pre-emptively recommend probation \u2014 even in serious sexual misconduct accusations \u2014 to avoid the possibility a doctor will get no sanction at all from a judge, said Laura Sweet, a former deputy director who retired in 2015.\n\nSweet, who worked for the medical board for 23 years, said the legal process focuses on the doctors and does not always give sufficient weight to the pain of alleged victims. \u201cYou\u2019re sending a message that\u2019s potentially minimizing what the victim endured.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Tracy Lystra sees it, too. In 2013, Lystra sued her Fallbrook, California OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he harassed her with comments about her body and how she aroused him, whispering into her ear as she lay on a gurney before surgery that she looked like a \u201csexy librarian.\u201d She said the case, which also alleged medical negligence, was settled for $150,000 in 2016. Bianchi, who could not be reached for comment, denied the allegations in court documents.\n\nThrough her attorney, Lystra filed a complaint to the medical board shortly after settling with Bianchi. This past July, she received a letter from the board saying it would not be able \u201cestablish grounds for discipline\u201d against Bianchi in her case, \u201cconsidering all the evidence and mitigating factors.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she learned that the board had received complaints from other women.\n\nIn 2014, Bianchi had been put on five years\u2019 probation after the board accused him of making inappropriate sexual remarks to two patients, telling one he dreamed of having oral sex with her and couldn\u2019t stop staring at her breasts. After learning of these cases, another woman came forward, alleging Bianchi several years earlier had blocked his office door with a chair, inserted his fingers into her vagina, exposed his penis and asked her for sex.\n\nThe board\u2019s penalty was another five years\u2019 probation. But the two probation terms overlap \u2014 and Bianchi, who agreed not to contest the allegations as part of the settlements in each case, could go back to work as an OB-GYN without restrictions in 2021. In the meantime, he is not allowed to treat female patients.\n\nLearning that Bianchi received such a light punishment \u2014 and that the board would not take action on her own complaint \u2014 was crushing, Lystra said, noting that it had been so difficult to get anyone, including her family, to believe her.\n\n\u201cI really wanted him stopped. It was so disappointing when medical board responded the way it did,\u201d Lystra said.\u201cIt was a slap in my face.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nIn its analysis, KHN requested every sanction for sexual misconduct issued by the Medical Board of California over the past 10 years, the name of each doctor involved and his or her license number. The board responded with 181 actions against 175 doctors from fiscal year 2008-09, beginning in July, through fiscal year 2017-2018, ending in June.

De Shay has lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that makes every pregnancy more risky for both her and the fetus.\n\n\u201cI was told that there was a high likelihood I would never have kids in the first place,\u201d De Shay said. \u201cBut my understanding of that, and the way it was communicated to me, was because my body wasn\u2019t going to get pregnant, not because my body was going to get pregnant and then try to kill me or the babies in the process.\u201d\n\nDe Shay also struggles to find high-quality, low-cost health insurance. She\u2019s one of the almost 9 million Americans who buy insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace every year. And as funding for the marketplace and federal subsidies continue to shrink, so too do her choices.\n\nDe Shay has no guarantee that the plan she purchases will still exist a year later, or stay the same price, when the next enrollment session begins. For instance, in 2017, one insurer canceled her policy after it claimed she didn\u2019t pay the premium \u2015 something De Shay disputes. Once the bill got sorted out, she was advised to move to a different plan altogether because the original one wouldn\u2019t be available the next year.\n\nOne University of Michigan study in 2015 found that more than half of marketplace buyers in Michigan that year had switched plans since 2014, either leaving the market, becoming uninsured or picking a different plan on the marketplace.\n\nOver the past decade, she estimates she\u2019s been on nine different insurance plans. This churn impedes her from managing her lupus with a long-term doctor that she trusts, and it makes it more difficult to obtain specialized prenatal care when she is pregnant.\n\nOn this episode of IVFML, we look at infertility that is exacerbated by manmade policies \u2015 not just a result of our bodies, but of the health care system we live with.\n\nListen to Episode 10 of \u2018IVFML Becoming Family\u2019 below.\n\nIn addition to learning about De Shay\u2019s personal story, we spoke to HuffPost senior writer Jonathan Cohn, who\u2019s an expert on health insurance coverage in the U.S. Cohn said that constantly churning through insurance plans makes chronic conditions like lupus even more difficult to manage, which in turn harms health.\n\nCohn said that the best way to deliver high-quality health care is to have continuity \u2015 the same primary doctor who sees you every year, coordinates specialist care and keeps tabs on your overall health. But switching plans every year also means switching provider networks, and that means you\u2019re likely to be restricted to a new group of doctors every single time.\n\n\u201cSo you get these situations where the physicians you\u2019re seeing don\u2019t know your history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to get tests taken over and over again, because the records from the last one didn\u2019t make it over to the new hospital you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nFor example, over the course of her adult life, De Shay had learned to recognize the signs of an impending pregnancy loss. First, her lupus symptoms would begin to intensify. Sometimes her hair would fall out, one side of her body would swell or become numb and she would faint. Then, the bleeding would start.\n\nAnd because she had learned to recognize the signs so well, dealing with new sets of doctors and health care providers for every single pregnancy who didn\u2019t know her history, and didn\u2019t know her as a person, became incredibly frustrating.\n\n\u201cAnd at no point does anybody even acknowledge what has really happened to you, much less the part that they played in it,\u201d she said about her losses, which she feels could have been avoided.\n\nDe Shay, who is black, suspected that her race may have played a role in the way her health care was mismanaged.\n\nIt\u2019s a concern familiar to ProPublica reporter Nina Martin, who interviewed hundreds of mothers and families for her 2017 project \u201cLost Mothers,\u201d an in-depth look at the rising maternal mortality rate in the U.S. \u2014 which is driven mostly by black women.\n\nMartin tells us in this episode that one of the most pressing refrains she kept hearing from the women was that their near-death experience wasn\u2019t their fault \u2015 and that they had told health care providers early and often about their symptoms.\n\n\u201cThey knew something was wrong, and they would tell their doctors, they would tell their nurses, they would try to tell people there is something the matter with me,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAnd people would say, no, no, no, you\u2019re wrong, this is just what it\u2019s like to be pregnant. This is what it\u2019s like to have a baby. There\u2019s nothing the matter with you.\u201d\n\nDuring De Shay\u2019s last pregnancy, she had to be hospitalized in the final trimester because of a lupus flare-up, and then she switched to a second hospital because her health insurance policy demanded it. She feels this final switch unnecessarily complicated her lupus, pregnancy and birth \u2015 and that the poor relationships she had with her new doctors almost cost her life."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Released From Hospital After Cancer Surgery", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-bader-ginsburg-released-from-hospital_us_5c238a87e4b05c88b6fcded3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been released from a hospital after undergoing surgery on Friday.\n\nThe 85-year-old underwent a pulmonary lobectomy in New York City to remove two malignant cancer growths from her left lung.

Her mother had been fatally shot by her boyfriend. When the girl tried to call 911, the man turned his shotgun on her.\n\nAfter hours of surgery, Brandt saved the child. Since then, Brandt, now a pediatric surgeon at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston, has operated on many more child shooting victims. \u201cAll of us have some patients who we can\u2019t forget,\u201d Brandt said of the young girl. \u201cIn terms of being able to not be sad about it, it took months and months. I\u2019m still probably a little sad about it.\u201d\n\nFew people in the world are more familiar with gun violence than emergency room doctors and surgeons like Brandt. But until recently they\u2019ve largely kept quiet about their experiences on the front line of this public health crisis.\n\nThat changed in November after the American College of Physicians issued new guidelines on how doctors can help protect patients from gun violence \u2015 and the National Rifle Association responded by telling physicians to \u201cstay in your lane.\u201d\n\nIn effect, the NRA wanted these doctors to shut up about an issue that touches their lives daily, leading to a record high of nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and around twice as many injuries each year.\n\nThe NRA retort was enough to lead many physicians to break their silence. Under the banner of \u201cThis is our lane,\u201d surgeons and other doctors thrust themselves into the gun debate, sharing photos from inside operating rooms and telling stories about the agony of treating an unending flow of shooting victims.\n\nMedical organizations also doubled down, calling for additional gun violence research and further pushing measures like universal background checks, waiting periods to buy guns, safe storage initiatives and so-called red flag laws designed to keep firearms away from people who may be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nNow, in a series of interviews with HuffPost, doctors are shedding additional light on the topic, painting a diverse portrait of a problem that afflicts communities in a variety of forms, including mass shootings, assaults, accidents, intimate partner violence and suicide.\n\nTheir accounts describe exhausting work that doctors have traditionally shouldered in private. Many doctors told HuffPost they feel it\u2019s their moral duty to show the public the truth: Gun violence is ubiquitous in emergency rooms all over the country.\n\nExposing people to that reality could resonate in a way that general facts and figures about gun violence haven\u2019t and show Americans that it\u2019s necessary to begin taking steps to address the crisis, Brandt said.\n\n\u201cHuman beings don\u2019t just change their minds because of data.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something I wish I could do something about, but I feel helpless. Dr. Adam Schechner, University of Maryland Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center\n\nWhen doctors see patients with gunshot wounds on a daily basis, it\u2019s hard to keep track of how many they\u2019ve treated.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew. Too many,\u201d said Dr. Adam Schechner, a trauma surgeon at the University of Maryland Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center in Cheverly.\n\nSchechner estimates he\u2019s tended to hundreds of shooting victims, the majority of them young men from Washington and the Maryland suburb of Prince George\u2019s County. Schechner recalled a case in which a young man died of his injuries. When Schechner informed the patient\u2019s mother, she broke down. The woman gathered herself long enough to explain that the son she\u2019d lost was the only family she had left. Her other son had been shot and killed a few years prior. She was alone.\n\n\u201cThat one really, really got to me,\u201d Schechner said.\n\nEven when his patients survive, it can feel as if he\u2019s working against a tide that will ultimately erase his work, Schechner said. Many of the gunshot victims that come into the hospital have been shot before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening because most of the time it seems like they just don\u2019t care, [like] they don\u2019t seem to appreciate the second chance they\u2019ve been given,\u201d Schechner said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the hardest part of my job: working to save somebody\u2019s life and then having them not appreciate that life.\u201d\n\nLast year, the hospital Schechner works at launched a program to help survivors who\u2019ve been shot or stabbed multiple times, providing wraparound care and social services designed to target the root causes of violence. The evidence so far suggests it\u2019s working.\n\nThe program is a critical step toward prevention, but it\u2019s hardly a catchall solution to gun violence, Schechner said. The more shooting victims he treats, the more he realizes this issue affects him not just as a doctor but also as the father of young children, who he fears he could someday find on an operating table with a gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cIt makes my life outside the hospital that much sadder, because it\u2019s something I wish I could do something about, but I feel helpless,\u201d Schechner said.\n\nIt was like a scene from hell. Dr. John Fildes, University Medical Center of Southern Nevada\n\nEven two decades as a trauma surgeon couldn\u2019t truly prepare Dr. John Fildes for the terror he encountered on Oct. 1, 2017.\n\nFildes began his shift at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas just minutes after the gunfire stopped at the Route 91 music festival, the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. There were already 35 people with gunshot wounds waiting in the trauma area, he said.\n\n\u201cThere was blood all over the floors and the gurneys, and there were patients that were holding pressure on their own wounds telling me to take care of the sicker patients,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cIt was like a scene from hell.\u201d\n\nFildes and his colleagues scrambled to get the most severely injured patients into the operating room and worked to stabilize the others. Most of the team managed to work through the paralyzing horror of the moment, though a handful of staffers were so emotionally jarred that they had to be briefly pulled away to compose themselves, Fildes said.\n\nDespite the circumstances, Fildes and the surgery department he chairs saved every one of the 104 patients connected to the shooting who arrived at the hospital alive.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Mourners gather at a makeshift memorial after the Route 91 shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nAny sense of triumph was short-lived, Fildes said. He still struggles to find words to describe what transpired that night.\n\n\u201cThis was 1,100 rounds of military-grade ammunition showered on 22,000 people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another one of these cases.\u201d\n\nAlthough the medical center began interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder the next day, in the year since the shooting, staffers have reported sleeplessness and repeated nightmares, Fildes said. A handful have required more serious care.\n\nThe Route 91 Harvest festival shooting was a horrific outlier, and Fildes said he hopes no surgeon will have to witness another massacre of this scale. But even doctors lucky enough to avoid mass shootings can\u2019t escape the constant drumbeat of more ordinary firearm injuries and deaths, he said. For many, that bloodshed is reason enough to speak out on gun violence.\n\n\u201cDoctors don\u2019t have a gun problem; they have a bullet hole problem,\u201d Fildes said, adding that a renewed focus on firearm safety, prevention and enforcing existing gun laws would go a long way toward saving lives.\n\nThere\u2019s only one degree of separation between you and everybody else. Dr. Christopher Barsotti, Berkshire Medical Center and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center\n\nWhen Dr. Christopher Barsotti, an emergency physician, moved to southern Vermont from a busy Chicago hospital known for treating shooting victims, he hoped he\u2019d be leaving gun violence behind. Instead, it became more personal.\n\nBarsotti sometimes recognizes patients he treats in the emergency room, or has at least met their family members or neighbors, he said. That can make cases even harder as he learns about the often tragic circumstances that precede shootings.\n\nBeyond self-inflicted gunshot wounds and instances of people \u201csettling scores,\u201d rural hospitals see plenty of hunting accidents, domestic violence or shootings involving children who\u2019ve accessed unsecured firearms, said Barsotti, who is a gun owner himself. In the worst cases, it may fall to Barsotti to deliver bad news to a person he knows.\n\n\u201cWhen you live out here, there\u2019s like 2 degrees separation between you and everybody else,\u201d Barsotti said. \u201cWhen you are actually working and taking care of people, there\u2019s only 1 degree of separation.\u201d\n\nSometimes the unthinkable happens. Dr. Richard Miskimins, a trauma surgeon at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, recalled operating on a patient who\u2019d been shot in the face. Hours later, he found out he knew the man.\n\n\u201cHe was so horribly disfigured that I didn\u2019t realize,\u201d Miskimins said.\n\nAlbuquerque is hardly a rural town, but as home to the state\u2019s only Level I trauma center, Miskimins and his colleagues treat a number of patients transferred from smaller counties in the state. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds are particularly common, Miskimins said. Although the vast majority of people who attempt to kill themselves with a firearm will die, those who don\u2019t are typically left with debilitating neurological or physical injuries that require intensive care.\n\nA few years ago, Miskimins treated a patient who\u2019d intentionally shot himself. After completing a lengthy recovery, including a facial reconstruction, the young man began visiting the ICU regularly to thank the staff, said Miskimins. The patient has since gotten involved in national suicide prevention efforts.\n\n\u201cSuicide is so often just an impulsive thing, where, in the depths of despair, they act,\u201d he said, citing studies showing that many people who survive suicide attempts don\u2019t go on to try again. When a gun is available, those impulses are far more likely to end in death.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the person who sustains the injury. Dr. Richard Miskimins, University of New Mexico Hospital\n\nGun violence isn\u2019t just a story of victims and perpetrators, Miskimins said. Whether fatal or not, every shooting ripples outward, touching not only the individuals directly involved but also their families, friends and loved ones, as well as the medical professionals who serve as intermediaries during these painful ordeals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the person who sustains the injury that has a significant psychological impact on them; it\u2019s also on their family that comes and sees them,\u201d Miskimins said.\n\nAs challenging as it can be for everyone to recover after a shooting, it pales in comparison to the alternative. Telling a parent that their child has been fatally shot never gets easier, said Dr. Mark Seamon, a trauma surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine. He said he changes into clean scrubs and takes a few deep breaths before giving the news.\n\n\u201cYou never know what their reaction will be,\u201d Seamon said. \u201cI\u2019ve had reactions where the mother would say, \u2018Well, we knew this was coming,\u2019 and just walk out.\u201d\n\nSo, a lot of folks have asked me about this photo: the chair. Why? Well, I have a chair for all the things I ROUTINELY do: my dinner chair, my reading chair, the chair where I rock my kids to sleep. And the chair where I tell parents their kids are dead. #ThisisOurLane pic.twitter.com/MNDutybXwC \u2014 Stephanie Bonne (@scrubbedin) November 17, 2018\n\nEven when a family fears the worst, they\u2019re never really prepared for it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain tenor, there\u2019s a certain pitch to their voices or the cry that they give when you tell them that their loved one has died,\u201d Barsotti said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound that hits you in the pit of your stomach.\u201d\n\nThe day you don\u2019t cry is the day you should quit. Dr. Mary Brandt, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nThe emotional burden of gun violence weighed heavily on the mind of every doctor HuffPost spoke with. When asked how they deal with it, there was less agreement.\n\nSome emergency rooms do their best to address grief in real time. When someone dies in the trauma bay at the University of New Mexico Hospital, they\u2019ll hold a brief moment of silence to reflect on the loss and acknowledge the staff, said Dr. Stephen Lu, a trauma surgeon.\n\n\u201cIt takes like 30 seconds, then we go on with the rest of the night,\u201d Lu said.\n\nTo handle the stress of a life-or-death job in the operating room, many doctors said they must be able to compartmentalize. For some, that may mean simply trying to bury the brutal reality of what they\u2019ve witnessed.\n\nSchechner, the doctor from Maryland, rarely talks about how his job affects him personally, he said, noting that surgeons are generally wary of showing any sign of weakness related to their work.\n\n\u201cEvery person that I pronounce dead from a gunshot wound takes a little piece of me,\u201d Schechner said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019re human, too, and we\u2019re not supposed to act like it.\u201d\n\nDespite perceptions of physicians as being unshakable, or even stolid, those qualities are just one part of the job, said Brandt, the pediatric surgeon from Texas. The other half involves being human. In the operating room, surgeons must focus on saving lives. \u201cAfterwards, we allow it to hit us,\u201d Brandt explained. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve always felt, and I have taught, is the day you don\u2019t cry is the day you should quit.\u201d\n\nTo the @NRA, this is what it looks like to stay in #mylane. We will not be silent about the toll of #gunviolence. I speak out for this patient, for their parents who will never be the same, for every person who came after this one and didn\u2019t have to #thisiseveryoneslane pic.twitter.com/B5mo6pC4dV \u2014 Kristin Gee, MD (@kmgee9) November 10, 2018\n\nDoctors manage these emotions with varying degrees of success. Traditionally, the medical profession has viewed self-care as selfish, maintaining that a physician\u2019s own needs are secondary to the patient\u2019s, said Dr. Jo Shapiro, director of the Center for Professionalism and Peer Support at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter three decades of practicing surgery, Shapiro was struck by the lack of attention paid to the people doing the work. It eventually became clear that physicians couldn\u2019t continue putting themselves last. Studies have shown that burnout, depression and other mental health problems plague the health care profession. And the doctors HuffPost spoke to were quick to note that the cascading effects of gun violence don\u2019t stop at physicians. They can touch everyone from nurses, to hospital support staff, to the custodians who clean blood off the floor of the ER.\n\nShapiro now directs a program that trains physicians how to support each other when they experience trauma on the job, whether it\u2019s an acute response to a particular case or the cumulative weight of unceasing gun violence.\n\n\u201cSomebody has to be there to help patients who have been shot, but it\u2019s very frustrating, saddening [and] hard to do over and over again,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt can be demoralizing.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019ve had someone die in your hands, that\u2019s easy to say. Dr. Stephen Lu, University of New Mexico Hospital\n\nSome doctors see the \u201cThis is our lane\u201d movement as an outlet not only to begin processing their grief but also to channel it toward solutions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such joy in thinking I\u2019m not just treating the end result, I\u2019m helping prevent this,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201d[It\u2019s] letting us bring our humanity back into our work.\u201d\n\nThis focus on prevention is also well-trod in the field of medicine, with doctors using similar methods to tackle past public health crises, such as HIV, smoking, motor vehicle deaths or environmental hazards and pollution. First, they study a problem to identify its patterns and root causes. Then they work to design policies in an effort to reduce those negative effects, rather than just treat them as they arise.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of firearm deaths and injuries, the political polarization has made many doctors hesitant to speak up, said Lu, the New Mexico trauma surgeon. By not speaking out, he said, doctors may have unintentionally sanitized the shootings that rip through American streets, homes, schools and ultimately hospitals tens of thousands of times each year.\n\n\u201cAmericans are shielded from death in general,\u201d Lu said, adding that it\u2019s one reason for the lack of compassion and empathy in the gun debate.\n\nYet it\u2019s people who lack this exposure, who likely have never seen a gunshot up close and hopefully never will, who are now telling doctors that gun violence is none of their business."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Arms Sales to Saudis Leave American Fingerprints on Yemen\u2019s Carnage", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/world/middleeast/yemen-us-saudi-civilian-war.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cIn the end, we concluded that they were just not willing to listen,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state and an incoming member of Congress from New Jersey. \u201cThey were given specific coordinates of targets that should not be struck and they continued to strike them. That struck me as a willful disregard of advice they were getting.\u201d\n\nYet American military support for the airstrikes continued.\n\nWhile American officials often protested civilian deaths in public, two presidents ultimately stood by the Saudis. President Obama gave the war his qualified approval to assuage Saudi anger over his Iran nuclear deal. President Trump embraced Prince Mohammed and bragged of multibillion-dollar arms deals with the Saudis.\n\nAs bombs fell on Yemen, the United States continued to train the Royal Saudi Air Force. In 2017, the United States military announced a $750 million program focused on how to carry out airstrikes, including avoiding civilian casualties. The same year, Congress authorized the sale of more than $510 million in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, which had been suspended by the Obama administration in protest of civilian casualties.\n\nNearly 100 American military personnel are advising or assisting the coalition war effort, although fewer than 35 are based in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAmerican support for the war met stiff headwinds this fall, when congressional fury over the murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi combined with worries over civilian deaths in Yemen.\n\nIn response, the Trump administration ended American air-to-air refueling of coalition warplanes over Yemen in November but has otherwise continued to support the war. This month, the Senate voted to end American military assistance to the war altogether, a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, but the bill died when the House refused to consider it.\n\nThe civilian toll is still rising. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, November was the most violent month in Yemen since the group began tracking casualties in January 2016. There were 3,058 war-related fatalities in November, it said, including 80 civilians killed in airstrikes."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Stocks Bounce Back From Edge of Bear Market", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/business/business-stock-markets.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "Worries about the White House\u2019s response to the meltdown in the financial markets have dovetailed with other concerns \u2014 including weakness in global trade and the economic impact of a potentially lengthy government shutdown \u2014 to feed the volatility on Wall Street.\n\n\u25a0 Trading was volatile, and stocks initially swung between modest gains and small losses.

Neither CZ nor its American subsidiary has been accused of a crime by federal authorities.\n\nIn a 2013 executive order, Mr. Obama called wildlife trafficking a national security issue because of its devastation of African wildlife and its destabilizing effect on local communities. Another order signed by Mr. Trump last year directed law enforcement agencies to increase their efforts to dismantle transnational smuggling organizations, including wildlife traffickers.\n\nThe American government has also stationed law enforcement officers from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in several African countries, including Botswana, to help local officials fight poachers. Over all, the American government spends about $150 million a year in efforts to fight wildlife trafficking and poaching.\n\nNow agents from the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security are investigating whether CZ or its subsidiary violated American laws by exporting rifles to Mozambique and whether the company continued to sell weapons even after being warned as early as 2015 that the rifles were used by poachers to kill protected wildlife in South Africa.\n\nThis fall, the House Foreign Affairs Committee began its own investigation into the use of possible illegally exported rifles in poaching crimes, requesting from federal agencies \u201cany and all information related to CZUB and its subsidiary CZ-USA and the selling of rifles to transnational criminal organizations,\u201d according to a staff member on the committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: Marburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/health/marburg-virus-fruit-bats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:59", "body_paragraphs": "The Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, has been isolated in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the first time it has been found in West Africa.\n\nFive bats caught in three health districts tested positive for the virus, according to two teams of scientists.

A vaccine is now available, and experimental treatments appear to be helping to save lives. With international help, Congo was able to quickly snuff out an earlier outbreak in its \u00c9quateur Province this year.\n\nYet eastern Congo, teeming with no fewer than 100 armed groups, has been gripped by near-constant conflict since the uprising that led to its independence in 1960, as well as the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda and the civil war soon after that eventually established the regime of Joseph Kabila.\n\nMillions are thought to have died from the chronic violence, many of them at the hands of government forces.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy drivers cause 16.5 percent of fatal crashes.\n\nA survey released last year by the National Safety Council found that 97 percent of workers have at least one risk factor for fatigue, with 27 percent reporting having unintentionally fallen asleep on the job in the previous month and 16 percent that they had experienced at least one safety incident because of fatigue.\n\n\u201cWe have a 24/7 society, so we knew fatigue was definitely affecting part of our work force,\u201d said Emily Whitcomb, senior program manager of the council\u2019s fatigue initiative. \u201cBut we did not anticipate that fatigue was going to be affecting almost 100 percent of our work force.\u201d\n\nSleep deprivation may even lead to ethical breaches at work. In a 2014 experiment, Christopher Barnes of the University of Washington and colleagues asked 142 people with extreme chronotypes to show up at their laboratory either at 7 a.m. or at midnight for a dice-rolling game that offered a $500 prize. Reporting was on the honor system. Morning people lied 18 percent more when they did the task at midnight than when they did it in the morning, whereas night owls lied 16 percent more when doing the task at 7 a.m.\n\nDr. Roenneberg has collected data from 300,000 people and found that chronotypes plot as a bell-shaped curve, with a few individuals at each extreme and most falling somewhere in the middle. According to Dr. Roenneberg\u2019s research, the most frequent chronotype \u2014 held by about 13 percent of the population \u2014 sleeps from around midnight to 8 a.m. Thirty-one percent of people have an earlier natural bedtime, and 56 percent have a later one. That means for at least 69 percent of the population, getting to the office by 8 or 9 a.m. requires waking up before their body is ready."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Take a Number: Long-Acting Contraceptives Gaining Acceptance Among U.S. Women", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/health/women-contraceptives.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 19:01:59", "body_paragraphs": "More than two-thirds of women of childbearing age in the United States use contraceptives, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlmost all American women turn to contraception at some point in their lives.

The best available evidence has shown that most of us would probably be best off aiming for moderation with regard to serum levels of HDL.\n\nA series of studies, large and small, in this country and abroad shows that the relationship of HDL levels to heart disease and overall mortality forms a U-shaped curve: too little and too much of this blood lipid are, on average, associated with an elevated risk of heart disease, cancer and premature death."}]
