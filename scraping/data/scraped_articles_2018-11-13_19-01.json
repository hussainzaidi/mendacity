Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nBut the President's intervention did underline how Washington's calendar seems to have already flipped to 2019.\n\nTrump and Democratic leaders are making calculations and staking out positions that will shape the new political environment, set the stage for the 2020 election, and could ultimately dictate Trump's political fate.\n\nThe arrival of a new class of lawmakers for orientation Tuesday will exacerbate the feeling of a fresh start, though critical business remains in the lame duck twilight of the GOP-led House \u2014 that could even degenerate into a government shutdown before year's end.\n\nOn talk shows in recent days, incoming Democratic committee chairmen fleshed out earlier promises to look into Trump's policies and personal affairs.\n\nAt the same time, the likely next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to keep talk of impeachment f rom bubbling over.\n\nSome Washington veterans are already seeking parallels from the past, including the period after the 1994 midterms, when a new GOP majority that came to be seen as overzealous gave President Bill Clinton a foil that he used to win re-election two years on.\n\nWith that in mind, House Democrats know they have to do enough to appease their voters outraged by Trump, 77% of whom, according to exit polls, support impeachment.\n\nBut moving too fast could harm the credibility of Democratic oversight and foster an impression it is motivated by purely political motives rather than being in the national interest, and could offer Trump an opening.\n\nThe party must also keep faith with the policy agenda that helped them win last week. That involves passing bills on securing coverage for Americans with pre-existing health conditions, acting to control the cost of college, and possibly working on infrastructure, even if most such measures hit a brick wall in the GOP Senate.\n\n\"I think the key word is balance in this,\" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank.\n\n\"There needs to be aggressive oversight of this administration,\" Kessler said. \"There has been no oversight for two years. I think the watchword would be -- make these investigations in the taxpayers' interests.\"\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman, one of Trump's most aggressive critics on Russia, says the political delicacy of the coming clash is one reason Democrats should retain Pelosi as leader, and speaker, even if more radical members of the new class want change.\n\n\"We need the strongest general that we have,\" Schiff said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend. \"We need the best tactician, we need the best organizer.\"\n\nPelosi wants her party to stay unified and temperate as they erect the new checks and balances against the President.\n\n\"We are responsible. We are not scatter shot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose but to seek the truth,\" she said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, a message she repeated in a letter to members Monday\n\n\"I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic,\" she told CBS.\n\nTrump's new reality\n\nThe President has been in a dark place since election day, as Democratic gains in slow moving counts underscored his rebuke by voters.\n\nHe and his top officials will soon be facing Democratic probes, hearings and potentially subpoenas on everything from his unreleased tax returns to the family separations storm, from his alleged obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe to his family finances.\n\nHe is already seeking to brand Democrats as a party obsessed with attacking him, while ignoring the challenges he believes many Americans care about, like the humming economy and what he sees as an immigration crisis.\n\nHe is leaving open the door to cooperation on some issues but warning that once Democrats crank up investigations, he is ready to use his power to target them, and grind government to a halt.\n\n\"I would blame them because they now are going to be coming up with policy. They're the majority in the House,\" the President said at a post midterm election news conference last week.\n\nTrump's first goal is to curate the battlefield ahead of his re-election bid in 2020 after Democratic gains repaired gaps in the party's blue wall in the Midwest that Trump tore down in 2016.\n\nBut, with the possibility of impeachment looming, depending on the contents of Mueller's final report, the President knows he must also act to shore up his support base in Congress, especially in the Senate.\n\nThere is no sign at this stage that there would be a two-thirds majority in the GOP-led chamber to convict him after any successful impeachment push in the House -- a factor that may convince Democratic leaders to avoid such a route.\n\nBut the most dangerous threat to his presidency -- as unlikely as it seems now -- would lie in any gathering political weakness that would erode his support among Senate Republicans.\n\nAfter all, President Richard Nixon resigned during Watergate not after admitting guilt, but after concluding that he no longer had \"strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing\" in office.\n\nTrump's desire to avoid a similar fate seems to lie behind his own obsessive efforts to bolster his political \"base\" and to show Republican lawmakers they would face a terrible price in their districts from deserting him. It also helps explain the aggressive campaign to discredit Mueller's \"witch hunt\" undertaken with the enthusiastic aid of conservative media.\n\nThe opening shots between Trump and resurgent Democrats show that the political battle between each end of Pennsylvania Avenue will be bitter and prolonged.\n\nAt the outset of this existential clash, it is less clear whether, given the polarization in Congress and the nation, there is any potential resolution, however it turns out, that will spare the stressed political system even more blows to its tattered legitimacy."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: Why McSally conceded before all votes were counted", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/H4qkMIgCzF0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Arizona Republican Rep. Martha McSally, curled up on the couch with her dog, announcing via a video on Twitter that she had conceded the state's Senate race to fellow Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat.\n\n\"I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate,\" said McSally of Sinema. \"I am convinced Arizona is the best state in the country and our best days are still yet to come.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nIt was a strikingly different tone than President Donald Trump took toward the race in a tweet over the weekend.\n\n\"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!,\" Trump tweeted , despite zero actual evidence of election fraud or even the allegation of the fraud. And a very different approach than that of the Senate Republican campaign arm, which emailed reporters after the election suggesting that election officials in Maricopa County (Phoenix) were trying to \"cook the books\" for Sinema.\n\nAnd the McSally concession came before all the votes were counted. According to CNN figures , Sinema held a 38,000-vote lead (out of more than 2 million cast).\n\nSo why did she do it -- particularly given that the President of the United States seemed convinced that she should have kept fighting?\n\nThe answer is that McSally is playing the long game. Or given the timing, the medium-ish game.\n\nRemember that Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, when accepting Gov. Doug Ducey's appointment to fill the seat of John McCain following the late senator's passing, made very clear that he wasn't planning to stick around the Senate all that long. \"I have committed to serving at least through the second session of the 115th Congress,\" Kyl said\n\n\"I do know I will not seek this seat in 2020, nor any other office in the future.\" Kyl told the Arizona Republic earlier this month that he planned to talk to Ducey about his future plan soon. \"I have family needs, as well, and so, we'll decide what to do at that point,\" said Kyl. \"I'll talk to the governor.\"\n\nAt a minimum then, we know that there will be another open-seat special election in Arizona in 2020. (That race will be for the remaining two years left on McCain's term; he was re-elected in 2016 and the race for the next full 6-year term will be in 2022.) And McSally, with an eye on that race, likely wants to not look like a sore loser or to keep up a nasty fight in a race she is very unlikely to win. Most voters like their election to end somewhere close to the actual vote and with a clean result -- either way. Continuing to charge at the electoral windmill rarely behooves a candidate's long-term political prospects.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that McSally may not even have to wait that long. Kyl's quotes about his future plans make clear that he was only wiling to pledge to serve until the end of the 115th Congress, which will come to an end shortly. If Kyl resigns his seat in early 2019, it would, again, be up to Ducey, who just got reelected, to appoint a successor to serve until the 2020 special election. McSally is far and away the likeliest pick for Ducey.\n\nAnd it's not hard to imagine that Kyl wanted to wait and see what happened in the 2018 election before making a decision on when he will walk away from the Senate. With McSally losing, Kyl now likely is further incentivized to leave before 2020 so as to give a Republican the best chance to hold the seat.\n\n\"Republican Martha McSally soon could be called Sen. McSally. More than one million Arizona voters wanted to see the former fighter-pilot-turned-southern-Arizona congresswoman in the Senate. Gov. Doug Ducey could grant them their wish. ... Ducey, with one stroke of a pen, could apply some desperately needed salve to the open, gaping wound that is post-election Arizona.\"\n\nSeen through the lens of her future political prospects, McSally's decision not to fight until the last vote makes a whole lot more sense. She's got an even-money (and maybe better) chance at making it to the Senate sometime in 2019. Why even risk jeopardizing that by fighting out a race that she almost certainly can't win?"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "CNN reporter explains why McSally lost", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/66E8V6UpbWo/arizona-senate-race-kyrsten-sinema-wins-martha-mcsally-concedes-ac360-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Republicans led in Florida, Nevada, Montana and Arizona. The only \"good\" news for Democrats was that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) had been re-elected in a overwhelmingly Republican state -- and even that news wasn't all that great given that Manchin is anything but a reliable Democratic vote.\n\nBoy, can a week change things.\n\nLate Monday, Rep. Martha McSally (R) conceded defeat to Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) in the Arizona Senate race , a pickup for Democrats. It was the latest in a series of positive developments for Senate Democrats over the past week -- from come-from-behind wins in Montana and Nevada to an ever-shrinking deficit (and an ongoing recount) in the Florida race between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Gov. Rick Scott (R).\n\nAt the moment, Democrats have lost a total of one seat from where they were before the 2018 election. The worst they will do is a net loss of two seats -- assuming Scott's 12,000-ish vote lead stands after the recount and appointed Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is doing herself no favors , wins the November 27 runoff against former Rep. Mike Espy (D). The best-case scenario for Democrats -- and, to be clear, this is NOT likely -- is a net gain of a single seat; that would mean Nelson somehow comes from behind in Florida and Espy wins the runoff in an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nLet's say that at the start of the next Congress Senate Republicans have gained two seats, expanding their majority from 51 to 53 seats. Which is, obviously, good for Republicans because, um, controlling more Senate seats is usually a better thing than a worse one.\n\nBut, context! Everyone seems to forget that the 2018 election cycle was a once-in-a-generation sort of map for Republicans. Democrats had to defend 26 seats as compared to just 9 for Republicans. Of those 26 Democratic seats, 10 -- 10! -- were in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016 including five (Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia) he won by double digits. When the 2018 cycle began, there was not-crazy talk among Republicans that they had an outside chance at controlling 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority -- at the start of 2019.\n\nFrom that to a modest gain (at best) is a big, big difference. And the reason that's important is that the battle for control of the Senate majority isn't a one-cycle affair. It's about minimizing your losses in bad cycles (when you have lots and lots of vulnerable seats up) and maximizing your gains in good ones.\n\nWhich brings us to the 2020 Senate map , in which 22 Republicans are up for re-election as compared to just 12 Democrats. Two Senate Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado -- will have to win reelection in states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Democrats are also likely to target Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, the Arizona seat (Sen. Jon Kyl is expected to resign sometime in early 2019 and will be replaced by an appointee chosen by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey) and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. For Democrats, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones is their biggest problem, and Republicans may seek to target Michigan Sen. Gary Peters as well.\n\nGo forward even two more years and you see another advantageous map for Democrats. Republicans will be defending 21 seats as compared to just 12 for Democrats. Democrats will take a very hard run at Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and the possible open seat currently held by Iowa's Sen. Chuck Grassley. Democratic vulnerabilities are somewhat limited, with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Colorado's Sen. Michael Bennet on the top of the list.\n\nHere's the point: If Democrats had lost, say, seven Senate seats in the 2018 election -- which was not an impossible thing to imagine back in January 2017 -- then the 2020 and 2022 cycles would be about shrinking the GOP majority rather than trying to take back control of the Senate. But with Republicans' best-case scenario looking like 53 seats, Democrats can now make a plausible case that they can retake the world's greatest deliberative body as soon as 2020.\n\nIf they do, the roots of that success were planted in 2018 -- and specifically how the party survived what could have been a generational wipeout that might have taken a decade or more to recover from. In politics, winning is always the goal. But minimizing your losses can be a kind of win too -- even if you have to wait for the ultimate reward."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Cooper to Trump: That's not how things work", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/9iheUibrfJI/anderson-cooper-trump-florida-fraud-claim-no-evidence-kth-ac-monologue-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nUS intelligence has long assessed that the North Koreans have stored much of their weapons capability, including mobile missile launchers, in underground mountain bunkers.\n\nSpecifically, the images focus on the Sakkanmol missile base, which \"currently houses a unit equipped with short-range ballistic missiles but could easily accommodate more capable medium-range ballistic warheads.\"\n\n\"Despite the difference in interpretation between the US government and the North Koreans over what these declarations have meant, the Singapore declaration and the new Korean declaration, for North Korea watchers it has been pretty clear that the North has not been willing to give up its entire nuclear program,\" Lisa Collins a fellow with the Korea Chair at CSIS and one of the authors of the report, told CNN.\n\nHowever, an official with South Korea's Blue House called the report \"nothing new\" and told media Tuesday \"the United States and South Korean intelligence service hold more detailed information using the military satellites,\" and that nuclear sites couldn't be \"undeclared\" as there had been no agreement with North Korea to declare them.\n\nThe official went on to say that North Korea had not previously pledged to close the Sakkanmol Missile Base, the focus of CSIS's report, saying, \"There had been no treaty or negotiation that mandated closing the missile base.\"\n\nMonday's report comes days after Trump told reporters his administration is \"very happy with how it's going with North Korea\" despite the administration's announcement, in the middle of the night as last week's midterm elections results were coming in, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been postponed.\n\nTrump has conveyed a starkly different image than the one painted by US military officials, foreign diplomats and sources familiar with developments who told CNN that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is \"really angry\" about the US refusal to offer sanctions relief and that personal friction between US and North Korean negotiators may be slowing progress.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang previously told CNN that North Korea's stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nBut the US appears unwilling to oblige, at the moment, according to a US official, who said the Trump administration wants to move away from the \"tit-for-tat\" approach of the past.\n\n\"There has been a move away from past administrations' approach to North Korea in terms of 'we will give you a little here if you give us a little there' ... kind of a tit-for-tat piece. ... We haven't seen that work in the past, so the President is insistent on holding the full pressure campaign until he gets the full denuclearization,\" a US official told CNN.\n\nNorth Korea has often argued it is unable to provide comprehensive details about the locations of its nuclear and missile sites because that could serve as a target list should the situation escalate into an armed conflict. But Collins said that the hope is that \"this type of analysis and data would help to push forward the negotiations rather than cause more blockage.\"\n\n\"It would actually get rid of one of the primary excuses or reasons why North Korea has not produced a list,\" she said, adding that \"open source and independent data\" can help the process as US officials might be wary of publicly disclosing information that they believe could compromise sources and methods.\n\nWhen asked about Monday's new report, a State Department spokesperson implored Kim to \"follow through on his commitments -- including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs.\"\n\n\"President Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments \u2014 including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs \u2014 a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people,\" the spokesperson told CNN.\n\nBut experts point out that Kim has not offered to stop producing ballistic missiles, let alone unilaterally give them up, and said on New Year's Day that he would continue to mass-produce ballistic missiles and deploy those that have already been tested.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Monday that the images once again show that Trump's comments on North Korea have been a \"fabrication.\"\n\n\"The North Koreans have not signed any document working out, laying out, what steps they are going to take to denuclearize,\" Hagel said. \"There has been nothing stated, agreed to, framed signed, except what President Trump says they've said ... but now ... we have a whole different story, and it is the reality, it is not fantasy,\" he added.\n\nVipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNN that Kim's actions do not amount to \"deception since he said on New Year's Day that North Korea would mass-produce and deploy its missiles that it already tested.\"\n\nNarang added that the images released Monday identify \"operating bases which, until and unless there is a deal, Kim can't eliminate without undermining his security.\"\n\nAsked about the State Department's response to Monday's report, Narang called the assertion that North Korea has committed to eliminating its ballistic missile programs is \"misleading.\"\n\n\"There has been no agreement or discussion remotely that detailed --- even on nuclear systems, and many of these are short range conventional missiles which North Korea has never said were on the table,\" he told CNN.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN that experts have known about these sites for years, and it is no surprise that they remain operational given Kim's declaration in January that North Korea would shift from research and development to the mass-production of nuclear systems.\n\n\"Kim didn't dupe Trump. Trump duped himself,\" Lewis said, noting that North Korea has never offered to unilaterally disarm.\n\nSakkanmol missile base is one of the facilities where North Korea deploys its mass produced systems, he said.\n\nStill, Trump has sought to convey the image that progress continues to be made and teased a possible second summit with Kim in the near future.\n\n\"We're in no rush. We're in no hurry,\" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference last week. \"The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes are home.\"\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nIn July, Trump touted indications that North Korea had begun dismantling \"a key missile site\" after the prominent monitoring group 38 North published images showing Pyongyang had begun decommissioning its Sohae Satellite Launching Station.\n\nBut while that step attracted significant media attention at the time, Monday's report states that the dismantling of the Sohae facility \"obscures the military threat to US forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases.\"\n\nCollins told CNN that she believes one reason North Korea canceled the latest round of talks with Pompeo is because they might be targeting \"the very top levels of negotiations\" -- another meeting between Trump and Kim.\n\nHowever, she also warned that \"you can't get anywhere without these working-level talks because that's where the nitty-gritty stuff happens.\"\n\n\"You can't get a verifiable list of anything unless nuclear weapons experts are part of the process,\" she said. \"Is President Trump going to create a list of all those facilities? Does he even know where some of these places are? I would be very skeptical.\"\n\n\"There have to be working-level talks, but the North Koreans are clearly targeting a big package deal, for them, which can only happen if President Trump is there to make the decision,\" Collins added. \"But I think the US has been very cautious and careful to keep the negotiations moving forward at the working level and try not to have President Trump jump every time there is an offer.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "'If you're going to die, die fighting.'

A lack of oxygen along with ash and hot embers getting into her eyes made it hard to escape.\n\n\"I put my hand out and I closed my eyes,\" she said. \"I ended up touching the back of a fire truck. I got over to the side of the fire truck, knocked on the doors ... and two firemen came out, picked me up and put me in their fire engine and put a fire blanket on the windows. It was just amazing.\"\n\nBut her ordeal wasn't over. The firefighters said they needed air support or they wouldn't make it.

She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"\n\nThe couple soon found themselves trapped with other evacuees in standstill traffic as the Camp Fire closed in.\n\n\"The flames were whipping and spreading so fast,\" Vaughan told CNN. \"It began to jump the road. There wasn't anywhere to go.\"\n\nPeople began to panic, Vaughan said. In the chaos, one driver backed up and slammed the front of Vaughan's SUV.\n\nMotorists began abandoning their cars, fleeing on foot with their children in tow.\n\n\"There were no firefighters in sight,\" Vaughan wrote on Facebook. \"I am hoping all of these people made it out.\"\n\nShe cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook.\n\nVaughan and her husband escaped before flames could engulf their car, she said.

He saw the smoke over Paradise on Thursday and said his intuition told him the fire was on a rapid path to destroy the town.\n\nHe was able to tell his wife, who took both children out of school before official evacuations began. As the family fled with their dog, cat and important documents, there were already spot fires near their home, Ratcliff told CNN.\n\nOnce they were safe, Ratcliff said, he had to make a decision: \"Do I go try to save other stuff (from our house) or do I go to try to let people know what was going on?\"\n\nHe chose the latter, evacuating residents from their houses and plucking them from the streets, putting them on Forest Service vehicles and racing them to points of protection set up by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nHe said it wasn't a difficult decision in the moment, but then he realized what things he lost forever in the house he left -- his children's handprints from kindergarten, and his wedding pictures.\n\n\"The guilt doesn't come until afterwards, when you realize you don't have that stuff anymore. ...

It burned through 20,000 acres in less than 14 hours on Thursday. By Monday, it had reached 113,000 acres.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties doubled in size in a 90-minute period Friday morning, to 8,000 acres. By Monday morning, it was up to more than 91,500 acres. The Hill Fire in Ventura County has torched 4,531 acres.\n\nHere's why the fires are moving so quickly:\n\nPowerful winds\n\nIn Southern California, the Santa Ana winds pushing the fires are expected to remain strong in Ventura and Los Angeles counties through Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said Monday.\n\nIn fact, the strongest winds for Southern California may come Tuesday and could reach near-hurricane gale force, he said.\n\nThese winds, which began in the middle of last week, may last through the end of this week.\n\nIn Northern California, the offshore winds that had been whipping the area for days are expected to die down Monday, Hennen said. The classic offshore flow was similar to the Santa Ana winds.\n\nLack of rain, dry conditions\n\nThough the drought in California has eased somewhat, all of the state is still abnormally dry, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. That makes a lot of dry vegetation for the fires to burn.\n\nMore than half the state is in a moderate drought or worse and 18% of the state, including the area near the Woolsey Fire, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nOver the past month, much of the state has received less than 5% of its normal rainfall.\n\nTim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, said the Camp Fire is \"unique to be this late in northern California.\"\n\nNormally, a series of storms would have dampened the woods and brush by now, he said Friday at a news conference. But it hasn't rained much this fall, he said, creating \"mid-summer-like conditions.\"\n\n\"It kind of lined up perfectly to have the large 90,000-plus acre fire run we had (Thursday),\" Chavez said. \"Fuels will continue to get drier and drier and drier until we do finally get a season-ending rainfall event.\"\n\nThe terrain makes it hard for firefighters\n\nThe hills and canyons of Southern California are beautiful, but they can make it difficult for firefighters to gain access to wildfires.\n\nThe fire that broke out Friday near the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens occurred on a steep hillside that could not be accessed by firetrucks, so firefighters had to approach the fire on foot, CNN affiliate KCBS reported.\n\nThe canyons can accelerate fires. They act as funnels for the wind, which pushes already heated air upward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Family prays as they drive through wildfire Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Family prays as they drive through wildfire 01:11\n\nClimate change may make things worse\n\nClimate change is not directly causing the fires to spread quickly, but it has created conditions conducive to feeding fires -- such as drier air and plant life. That's contributing to more days of extreme fires, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nCalFire says the five most destructive fires in California history have occurred since 2015. The organization has been keeping statistics for 100 years. The list does not include the Camp Fire, which would top the list.\n\nAnd a Columbia University study released in 2016 says human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the Western United States over the last 30 years.\n\nCalifornia's fourth climate change assessment, issued last August, said the state's forests will become more vulnerable to wildfires because of climate change.\n\nThe assessment says that by the year 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77%.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the state's number of most-destructive fires that have occurred since 2015.

Republicans led in Florida, Nevada, Montana and Arizona. The only \"good\" news for Democrats was that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) had been re-elected in a overwhelmingly Republican state -- and even that news wasn't all that great given that Manchin is anything but a reliable Democratic vote.\n\nBoy, can a week change things.\n\nLate Monday, Rep. Martha McSally (R) conceded defeat to Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) in the Arizona Senate race , a pickup for Democrats. It was the latest in a series of positive developments for Senate Democrats over the past week -- from come-from-behind wins in Montana and Nevada to an ever-shrinking deficit (and an ongoing recount) in the Florida race between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Gov. Rick Scott (R).\n\nAt the moment, Democrats have lost a total of one seat from where they were before the 2018 election. The worst they will do is a net loss of two seats -- assuming Scott's 12,000-ish vote lead stands after the recount and appointed Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is doing herself no favors , wins the November 27 runoff against former Rep. Mike Espy (D). The best-case scenario for Democrats -- and, to be clear, this is NOT likely -- is a net gain of a single seat; that would mean Nelson somehow comes from behind in Florida and Espy wins the runoff in an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nLet's say that at the start of the next Congress Senate Republicans have gained two seats, expanding their majority from 51 to 53 seats. Which is, obviously, good for Republicans because, um, controlling more Senate seats is usually a better thing than a worse one.\n\nBut, context! Everyone seems to forget that the 2018 election cycle was a once-in-a-generation sort of map for Republicans. Democrats had to defend 26 seats as compared to just 9 for Republicans. Of those 26 Democratic seats, 10 -- 10! -- were in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016 including five (Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia) he won by double digits. When the 2018 cycle began, there was not-crazy talk among Republicans that they had an outside chance at controlling 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority -- at the start of 2019.\n\nFrom that to a modest gain (at best) is a big, big difference. And the reason that's important is that the battle for control of the Senate majority isn't a one-cycle affair. It's about minimizing your losses in bad cycles (when you have lots and lots of vulnerable seats up) and maximizing your gains in good ones.\n\nWhich brings us to the 2020 Senate map , in which 22 Republicans are up for re-election as compared to just 12 Democrats. Two Senate Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado -- will have to win reelection in states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Democrats are also likely to target Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, the Arizona seat (Sen. Jon Kyl is expected to resign sometime in early 2019 and will be replaced by an appointee chosen by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey) and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. For Democrats, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones is their biggest problem, and Republicans may seek to target Michigan Sen. Gary Peters as well.\n\nGo forward even two more years and you see another advantageous map for Democrats. Republicans will be defending 21 seats as compared to just 12 for Democrats. Democrats will take a very hard run at Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and the possible open seat currently held by Iowa's Sen. Chuck Grassley. Democratic vulnerabilities are somewhat limited, with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Colorado's Sen. Michael Bennet on the top of the list.\n\nHere's the point: If Democrats had lost, say, seven Senate seats in the 2018 election -- which was not an impossible thing to imagine back in January 2017 -- then the 2020 and 2022 cycles would be about shrinking the GOP majority rather than trying to take back control of the Senate. But with Republicans' best-case scenario looking like 53 seats, Democrats can now make a plausible case that they can retake the world's greatest deliberative body as soon as 2020.\n\nIf they do, the roots of that success were planted in 2018 -- and specifically how the party survived what could have been a generational wipeout that might have taken a decade or more to recover from. In politics, winning is always the goal. But minimizing your losses can be a kind of win too -- even if you have to wait for the ultimate reward."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "2018 midterms update: What has changed since election night", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/qjfzVMRUzTM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The state of play in key races has shifted since election night almost one week ago, offering a different picture of where the balance of power will stand in Washington come January.\n\nDemocrats have taken the lead in a handful of key House races while the margin in Florida's senate race has narrowed, forcing a recount.\n\nA key US Senate race in Arizona was settled on Monday night -- six days after Election Day -- when Republican Rep.

The Senate race in Florida remains undecided and the Mississippi Senate race is going to a runoff later this month.\n\nThe win comes despite President Donald Trump and Republicans pushing false conspiracy theories about why ballots in Arizona were taking so long to count.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday that \"electoral corruption\" was taking place and suggested Arizona should have a new election. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, in an email to reporters, accused the Maricopa County recorder of trying to \"cook the books\" for Sinema.\n\nThe reality is about three-fourths of Arizona's ballots are cast by mail. Because of a state law requiring ballots to be sealed and signed, and signatures to match those on voter registration forms, it routinely takes the state longer than most to tally its results.\n\nMcSally's campaign and state-level GOP officials ignored national Republicans' tactics of casting doubt on the election's results.\n\nA shifting Sun Belt\n\nSinema's victory showed that Democrats are continuing to gain momentum in the rapidly diversifying Sun Belt and firmly places Arizona among the most important presidential and Senate battlegrounds.\n\nThe race was certain to deliver Arizona its first female senator. And it came at a time of major change in the state's delegation.\n\nTrump long sought to recruit a Republican to run in the primary against Sen. Jeff Flake, a critic of the President's incendiary rhetoric. At a 2017 rally in Phoenix, Trump huddled backstage with then-state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham and then-Rep. Trent Franks to discuss a potential primary.\n\nRather than face an all-but-certain loss to a Trump-aligned candidate in a primary, Flake retired, opening up the seat on this year's ballot.\n\nThen, in August, longtime GOP Sen. John McCain died. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Republican former Sen. Jon Kyl to the seat, but Kyl has committed to filling it only through this year -- leaving the possibility that Ducey could have to select another new senator in the coming weeks or months. Either way, McCain's seat is on the ballot in 2020 and is sure to be a top Democratic target.\n\nThe upheaval comes as Arizona, long a Republican bastion, emerges as a swing state in presidential elections. Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by just 4 percentage points there. The result, and the state's growing Latino population, solidified Arizona as a battleground moving forward.\n\nThe fight between McSally and Sinema was bitter, with both drastically shifting their previous positions.\n\nAttempting to prove her conservative bona fides during a primary fight with former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, McSally abandoned her previous support for moderate immigration bills.\n\nSinema's House record ranks her among the most centrist Democrats -- but McSally seized on her rival's past as an anti-war activist, airing a television advertisement featuring Sinema protesting in a pink tutu. McSally told The Arizona Republic that Sinema \"has a lot of explaining to do if you look at her Green Party-pink tutu, proud Prada socialist past and her extreme makeover.\"\n\nLatino Democratic strategists, meanwhile, groused that Sinema had moved too far right on immigration to appeal to a crucial, growing portion of the Democratic electorate.\n\nThe focal point of the contest, though, was health care -- particularly pre-existing conditions. Sinema and Democratic groups lambasted McSally's vote for a House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare, which nonpartisan experts said would weaken the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMcSally responded with advertisements claiming to be \"leading the fight\" to ensure those people are protected -- even though, under Obamacare, they already are, and the fight in Congress was over Republicans' efforts to change those protections."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: 'I want women to see that you do not get pushed around'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/fv_ZEQK-1Xg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Our series returns after a midterm election that delivered historic numbers of women to Congress.

It is how she got there -- excelling in a man's world and playing in what was traditionally a boy's club of politics -- as well as, and often better than, her male counterparts.\n\nShe's had plenty of detractors and naysayers, even among Democrats. But she is seen as effective, so much so that even her political opponents -- mostly men -- have repeatedly told me over the years that they marvel at her leadership of her caucus.\n\nFor all the interviews Pelosi does, she doesn't talk often about her struggles and challenges as a woman. But here, she spoke quite candidly about it all.\n\n\"I get some names called, because if you're effective as a woman, then they have to undermine you, because that's a real threat,\" Pelosi told us in an interview.\n\n\"I'm probably more of a target than anybody, except for somebody who runs for president,\" she said.\n\nTalk about an understatement. For years Pelosi has been the ultimate Republican boogeyman -- or boogeywoman, as it were. She's a frequent target of Republican ire for being too far to the left -- and she's also a target among progressives for not being far left enough.\n\nSome fellow Democrats are now distancing themselves from Pelosi, promising not to vote for her as House speaker again even though her party has won a majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections and shifted the power dynamics in President Donald Trump's Washington.\n\nSo far, no one has emerged to challenge her. And Pelosi is unmoved.\n\n\"I have a broad base of support in the country, financially, politically, and otherwise, which is valuable to our caucus,\" argued Pelosi.\n\n\"None of us is indispensable, but some of us are just better at our jobs than others,\" she added matter-of-factly.\n\nShe toots her own horn to show women how it's done\n\nAs she was telling me how qualified she is to be House speaker again, it struck me how unusual it is to hear a woman talk so confidently about how uniquely qualified she is for a job or position she is seeking. Though I am no shrinking violet, it is often hard for me to toot my own horn that way, something I admitted in the moment to Pelosi.\n\n\"For most women, frankly, myself included, it is hard to say those words, 'I am uniquely qualified. I deserve this. I earned this. I can do this better than anyone else,'\" I told Pelosi.\n\n\"You know why I do it? I do it, because I want women to see that you do not get pushed around. You don't run away from the fight,\" she responded.\n\nWhere it all started: Little Italy, Baltimore\n\nI have covered Pelosi for years, and always wondered how she learned to operate and excel in politics the way she does.\n\nFor the answer, we went with Pelosi back to where it all started: Little Italy, in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was born to US Rep. Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. and Anunciata D'Alesandro.\n\nWhen she was six years old, her father became Baltimore's first Catholic mayor.\n\n\"He leapfrogged over the Irish. That was a big deal, but it took political organizing to do that,\" Pelosi explained in an interview at Sabatino's, an Italian restaurant she frequented with her family growing up.\n\nMuch has been made of her father's influence on her. Less known is her mother's. Anunciata, who also went by Nancy, was an inventor who patented a device to apply steam to the face -- effectively an at home facial.\n\nBut she didn't pursue that passion. She was held back, Pelosi has said, by the times -- and by her father.\n\nInstead, Pelosi's mother helped her father in politics, who was a US representative from Maryland's 3rd Congressional District before he went on to be mayor.\n\n\"My mother was very much a part of the organizing. My father was the orator,\" recalled Pelosi.\n\nHer older brothers said their mother ran what they jokingly called her \"moccasin brigade\" of other women who would go to political events and get the message out.\n\n\"There are two things about what I bring with me from my family in this regard,\" Pelosi said. \"One is to know how to count. That's very important. Count your votes to win the election. Count your votes to win a vote on the floor. The other is listen to your constituents.\"\n\nBut Pelosi says the idea that because she grew up in politics, she always knew that was where she was headed is a myth.\n\n\"People are always saying, 'Oh, she knew when she was a little girl she wanted to run for office.' I never thought of that at all, ever, until I did,\" she insisted.\n\nAfter college, she wanted to go to law school. Instead, like many in her generation, she got married and started a family.\n\n\"When I got married and I had a baby, and then another baby, five in six years,\" Pelosi recalled.\n\nThe Pelosis moved back to husband Paul's hometown of San Francisco. Over the years, she became more and more active in the Democratic Party. But it wasn't until her youngest daughter, Alexandra, was a senior in high school that she ran for an open House seat.\n\nPelosi tells the story that she went to Alexandra and told her she had a chance to run for Congress. She said her daughter's response was \"get a life.\"\n\n\"And I did,\" Pelosi added.\n\nPelosi in 'awe' of female lawmakers with young children\n\nWhether she planned it or not, the path that Pelosi took to the House is the one most women used to follow. Women raised their kids, and then they went into politics. \"I was sequential,\" is how Pelosi explains her experience and that of the few women of her generation who actually ran for office.\n\nBut that's not the case anymore. Historic numbers of women with young children were already serving in the House and Senate before the election, and that will spike even more once the new 116th Congress is sworn in early next year.\n\nShe says she is in awe of the women she serves and works with who are in the throes of parenting.\n\n\"I want more young women in Congress who are in the course of raising their children, because it's important for women in that situation to see someone who shares their experience at the table,\" she said.\n\n\"Being a mom, what are you? You're a diplomat, interpersonal relationships. You're a chef. You're a chauffeur. You're a problem solver. You're a nurse. You're a health care provider. You have so much, and that's just with the children, not to mention the other aspects of family,\" said Pelosi, who notes that motherhood made her much more efficient.\n\n\"I don't think that before I had five children in six years that I used time as effectively as I did as a mom. ... I didn't even have time sometimes to wash my face,\" she laughed, knowing every mother can relate.\n\nThe young kids by her side now are her grandchildren. Two of them, Paul and Thomas, were at the podium for her election night victory speech when Democrats learned they'd retaken control of the House.\n\nNot long ago, Democratic men didn't think much of women in leadership\n\nRight now, a historic 102 women are set to be sworn into the House, and that number could rise even more as a handful of outstanding races are decided.\n\nWhen Pelosi got to the House in 1987, there were only 24 women serving. She says having five older brothers came in handy.\n\n\"Growing up in a family of boys helped me, because I was unimpressed,\" she said.\n\nWhen she first ran for House leadership 18 years ago, her male Democratic colleagues didn't get it.\n\n\"When people came to me and said, 'You should run for leadership,' and I agreed to look at it, then some of the men said, 'Who said she could run?' That was a real motivator.\"\n\nShe also remembers the men being told that \"a lot of the women are supporting Nancy to run.\"\n\nThe men responded by saying, \"'Well, why? Do the women have a list of things they want us to do? Why don't they just make a list and give us the list?' This is the Democratic Party in the year 2000,\" Pelosi recalls, a tone of disbelief still in her voice.\n\nHow does she wield power differently than a man?\n\nPelosi says that after meetings, people ask her, \"Do you understand how different that meeting would have been if a man were conducting it?\"\n\nShe says she is told that she listens more carefully than men who conduct meetings.\n\n\"You build consensus,\" Pelosi adds.\n\nShe used that female sensibility to gather votes for hard-to-pass legislation many times over the years, but passing the Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as Obamacare, is probably the prime example.\n\nIt has been widely reported that in January 2010, after Senate Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority when Republican Scott Brown won a special election, many thought passing the Affordable Care Act, which was not going to get GOP votes, was a lost cause. But Pelosi convinced then-President Barack Obama and others in the White House that it was doable -- and, along with then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, they got it done.\n\nTo be sure, the GOP backlash contributed to Democrats losing control of the House in 2010 and Pelosi losing the speakership. But it hasn't been repealed, and she still counts that -- getting Democrats to vote yes despite, for many, the political peril, as one of her biggest legislative accomplishments.\n\nHer advice for women transcends politics\n\n\"Have you ever been to a meeting when you're at the table, and a woman makes a suggestion, and then they go to the next person, and then two persons later a man makes the same suggestion, the other gentleman at the table say, 'That's a great idea'\"? Pelosi asked me.\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, because, what woman hasn't had that experience?\n\n\"What I have learned later in life, I've concluded, that the reason that they didn't recognize the merit when a woman suggested it is they didn't even listen. They did not even listen to the woman. That's why I say to people, 'Make sure that you have a give-and-take on what you suggest, because some man's going to get the credit for your idea.'\"\n\nShe says she likely would have stepped down had Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton become president. But when Clinton lost, Pelosi felt compelled to stay on so that there would still be a woman at the table for high-level meetings.\n\nShe calls President Donald Trump \"respectful of the office that I have,\" but notes they didn't have many bipartisan meetings to date.\n\nTrump praised Pelosi last week during his post-midterms news conference in the White House.\n\n\"I gave her a lot of credit, she works very hard and she's worked long and hard,\" he said when asked about opportunities for bipartisanship and working across the aisle. \"I give her a great deal of credit for how she's worked and what she's accomplished.\"\n\nWith her on track to hold the speaker's gavel again next year, that's likely to change -- and it will be up Pelosi to take her own advice for women.\n\n\"You know what the subjects are,\" she said. \"You know how to get it done. Be your authentic self. Be yourself. Know your power.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Kirstjen Nielsen could be asked to resign soon, officials predict", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/p7RuQxhgO5s/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump has been eyeing potential replacements for several senior positions in his administration -- both inside the West Wing and across the Cabinet , multiple officials familiar with the matter said.\n\nWith the exception of his family working inside the White House, few aides feel completely secure as he considers a major shakeup, the officials said.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen, his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is potentially the next to go, multiple officials with knowledge of the matter said. Her departure could portend another high-profile exit: chief of staff John Kelly, Nielsen's top advocate in the administration.\n\nTrump could ask Nielsen to resign in the coming days, multiple officials familiar with the matter predicted, describing the President's continued frustration at her handling of his signature issue: immigration and border security.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly is also on the list of possible resignations, despite Trump saying earlier this year he is welcome to stay in the post until the end of the President's term. Trump has been discussing a handful of replacements, including Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff. The President had a long conversation with him on midterm election night last week, and has grown to like him, two officials said, but they cautioned it is far from certain whether Trump will dismiss Kelly and elevate Ayers.\n\nAyers is not traveling with the vice president in Asia this week.\n\nIn recent weeks, the President has resumed polling advisers on potential replacements, as he did several months ago before ultimately announcing that Kelly would remain on as his chief of staff through his 2020 re-election campaign\n\nAyers has told at least two friends he is in the running for the position, but it's unclear whether he knows his true standing in the volatile West Wing. He has grown close to the President and key members of the administration, including the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and is valued for his political acumen -- something Trump allies have long grumbled that Kelly lacks.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House questioned how serious Ayers was under consideration. Other top aides, such as adviser Johnny DeStefano and budget director Mick Mulvaney, are also being discussed -- as well as others outside the administration.\n\nDeStefano has presided over a growing portfolio inside a White House known for its complicated internal dynamics. He started out overseeing of the Office of Presidential Personnel, and has since been placed in charge of the political shop and the Office of Public Liaison.\n\nA source close to Mulvaney said he is no longer interested in the chief of staff position. He is now far more interested in a Cabinet position as a next move, the source said.\n\nSome Trump allies are urging the President to bring someone in from the outside, but it's an open question how attractive the position would be.\n\nTrump hints at change\n\nJUST WATCHED Jeff Sessions out as attorney general Replay More Videos ...

Bush's administration, never overcame internal skepticism about her allegiance to Trump. She joined the administration as chief of staff to John Kelly, who was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary.\n\nWhen Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff, Nielsen followed, becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff.\n\nNielsen is widely viewed as an acolyte of Kelly, the retired Marine general who has his own complicated relationship with the President. Kelly has staunchly defended Nielsen against criticism of her performance on immigration-related matters. He's also been forced to defend her to the President, who has expressed suspicion over the jobs she held in the Bush administration.\n\nTrump has angrily aired his frustrations with Nielsen's handling of border security during contentious meetings at the White House, claiming she isn't up to the task of fulfilling the campaign promises he made to curb illegal immigration. That, in turn, has led to an internal dynamic where some officials have griped to the President about Nielsen's performance in order to gain favor with him.\n\nThe President has not sought to quell that dynamic, believing that pitting camps of aides against each other is a way to produce better results.

In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 80 confirmed cases of the illness, and 219 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Freakshakes contain \"grotesque\" levels of sugar, say campaigners", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/gt9K3m_NJAI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) It will come as no surprise that milkshakes loaded with sweets, chocolate bars, cream and cake, known as freakshakes, contain \"grotesque levels\" of sugar.\n\nBut now one campaign group wants them to be labeled with a nutrition warning and the worst offenders banned.\n\nAction on Sugar, based at Queen Mary University of London in the UK, conducted a survey of 140 drinks at UK fast-food chains and restaurants and found they contained \"alarming\" levels of sugar and calories.\n\nThe \"Unicorn Freakshake\" sold by UK restaurant chain Toby Carvery was the worst of those surveyed, containing more than six times the recommended daily amount of sugar for children between the ages of 7 and 10.\n\nAt 1,280 kilocalories it contains more than half the recommended 2500 calorie intake for an adult.\n\n\"An average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories!\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe drinks are popular on Instagram, where the general rule is that the bigger the tower of sugary items, the more delicious the drink.\n\nThe perfect cool down... pic.twitter.com/MegaWgyGE6 \u2014 Toby Carvery (@tobycarvery) August 22, 2018\n\nThe next worst offender on Action on Sugar's list was Five Guys' banana and chocolate shake with 1,073 calories -- the equivalent of more than four cans of cola.

Others that were surveyed included Handmade Burger Company and TGI Fridays, both of which were among several companies that do not publish nutrition information about their shakes.\n\nBattling obesity\n\nThe UK has been battling the rising tide of childhood obesity, with almost a third of children aged 12-15 overweight or obese. This is not only associated with social and psychological problems but also a host of serious diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer.\n\nIn August 2016, Public Health England (PHE) set out its approach to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by launching a structured sugar reduction program to remove sugar from everyday products. All sectors of the food and drinks industry were challenged to cut sugar content by at least 20% by 2020.\n\n\"Despite milkshakes being incorporated into Public Health England's sugar reduction program as part of the government's childhood obesity plan, it is clear from our survey that much more needs to be done than a 20% reduction, said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar. \"These very high-calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffer from tooth decay -- that is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe group is urging health authorities to go further by calling for mandatory traffic light colored nutrition labeling across all menus. In addition, the group has called for an outright ban on the sale of milkshakes containing more than 300 calories per serving.\n\nAccording to the charity's research, nine out of 10 milkshakes sold in UK supermarkets would be eligible for a red label for the excessive level of sugar they contain. Nevertheless, these products contained far less sugar than the freakshakes sold in fast-food outlets.\n\n\"Milkshakes can contain significant amounts of sugar,\" said Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE in response to the report. \"The food and drink industry -- including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers -- has a key role in helping to tackle this by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nA spokesman for Toby Carvery said: \"Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children.\"\n\nThe chain is \"very mindful of our role in helping guests make informed decisions\" and makes public the nutrition information for its menu, the spokesperson said.

The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides.

And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled. But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: UK and EU 'agree text' of draft withdrawal agreement", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46188790", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ministers are to be called in to see the prime minister this evening\n\nUK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement in a significant breakthrough for the talks.\n\nA cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week.\n\nA special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing.\n\nThe prime minister is currently meeting ministers for one-to-one talks as they are given sight of the draft agreement.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Chief Whip Julian Smith are among those who have been seen entering Downing Street.\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell said he had yet to see the detail but he was \"encouraged\" by the progress made.\n\nBut leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, have urged the cabinet to reject the draft agreement - which includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\".\n\nThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been the last major outstanding issue to be settled amid disagreements over how to guarantee that there will not be physical checks reintroduced after Brexit.\n\nCabinet ministers were briefed on the state of the negotiations earlier on Tuesday, when they were told a \"small number of outstanding issues\" remained to be sorted.\n\nNo 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to \"consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps\".\n\nBefore they do so, they will be able to read relevant \"documentation\".\n\nCranking into action\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAgreement is finally in Number 10's grasp.\n\nThe text that's taken months of officials' blood, sweat and tears has been agreed, at least at a technical level.\n\nNow a paper's being drafted to present to the Cabinet tomorrow ready for the government's hoped-for next step - political approval from Theresa May's team, even though many of them have deep reservations.\n\nRemember in the last 24 hours some of them have been warning privately that what's on the table is just not acceptable, and will never get through Parliament.

The Premier League means so much to so many people,\" said Dinnage, who will begin her new job early in 2019.\n\n\"It represents the pinnacle of professional sport and the opportunity to lead such a dynamic and inspirational organisation is a great privilege.\n\n\"With the support of clubs and the team, I look forward to extending the success of the league for many years to come.\"\n\nDinnage will become just the third person to lead the Premier League, after Scudamore and his predecessor Rick Parry.\n\nPrior to joining Discovery in January 2009, Dinnage worked for 10 years at Channel Five and she started her career at MTV.\n\n\"We are very pleased to appoint such a capable leader to this important role,\" said Bruce Buck, Chelsea's chairman and chair of the Premier League's nominations committee.\n\n\"We had a very strong field, but Susanna was the outstanding choice given her track record in managing complex businesses through transformation and digital disruption.\n\n\"She is a leading figure in the broadcasting industry, a proven business executive and a great developer of people. She is ideally suited to the role and we are confident she will be able to take the Premier League on to new heights.\n\n\"Richard Scudamore, having provided exceptional stewardship for almost 20 years, will leave us at the end of the year in great shape and with an excellent executive team and board able to fully support Susanna.\"\n\nScudamore was the Premier League's executive chairman but the top-flight clubs had already agreed to split his role. The search for a non-executive chair will now begin, the league said.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhen she takes up her role in the new year, Susanna Dinnage will become the most senior female leader in the world's major professional sports leagues. And because of the commercial wealth, global popularity and cultural influence of the Premier League, arguably the most powerful figure in British sport.\n\nAlthough she is a Fulham season-ticket holder, Dinnage does not have experience within the football industry, and some traditional match-going fans will worry that the appointment of a media executive reinforces the sense that professional football is in thrall to television.\n\nBut with sports audience habits shifting, a decrease in the value of the latest domestic TV rights deal, and new digital challengers emerging in the market, Dinnage's experience of tough negotiations at Discovery should also be useful.\n\nHowever, with the biggest clubs jostling for more of a share of overseas TV revenue, the task of emulating outgoing Richard Scudamore and keeping the cosmopolitan league's billionaire owners unified will be a challenging one.\n\nWith Brexit looming, relations with the FA and the government will be priorities, along with the regulation of agents, and reviewing the sport's close relationship with the gambling industry. And after the recent collapse of the sale of Wembley to Shahid Khan, many in the game will hope that Dinnage also persuades the clubs to invest more of their wealth towards grassroots facilities and player welfare at academies."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Border officer caught smuggling drugs and guns", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46194650", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:38", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright CPS Image caption Simon Pellett, David Baker and Alex Howard will be sentenced on Friday\n\nA corrupt UK border officer has been found guilty of attempting to smuggle firearms and drugs into the country.\n\nSimon Pellett, from Dover, was on duty when he was arrested by French officers in October last year.\n\nJurors at Isleworth Crown Court heard he was caught with holdalls containing eight pistols, two revolvers, ammunition, and heroin and cocaine with a combined street value of \u00a33.4m.\n\nPellet, 37, will be sentenced on Friday alongside two accomplices.\n\nImage copyright CPS Image caption These items were loaded by David Baker and Alex Howard onto an unmarked Border Agency van driven by Simon Pellett\n\nThe arrests were made following a joint investigation involving the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and French police.\n\nThe NCA had placed a listening device in the work van Pellett collected from his office in Folkestone before he got on a Channel Tunnel shuttle service.\n\nHe was recorded making arrangements to meet other members of the crime group in Loon Plage, between Calais and Dunkirk.\n\nHe met Alex Howard, 35, from Sittingbourne, and David Baker, 55, from Eltham, for a handover in a supermarket car park.\n\nThe two men had just placed three holdalls in the back of his van when French officers moved in to arrest them.\n\nThe firearms included self-loading and machine pistols, revolvers and silencers.\n\nThere was also ammunition for a submachine gun.\n\nImage copyright NCA Image caption French police discovered these drugs and weapons after a joint investigation with the National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police\n\nA spokesman for the NCA said investigators believe Pellet would have been paid about \u00a320,000 for the smuggling run.\n\nAll three men were extradited from France back to the UK for trial.\n\nOn Monday Pellett and Baker were found guilty of attempting to import firearms, heroin and cocaine.\n\nPellett was also found guilty of misconduct in a public office.\n\nOn Tuesday morning Howard was found guilty of drug importation charges but cleared of the firearms charge.\n\nKate Mulholland, a specialist prosecutor for the London Crown Prosecution Service complex casework unit, said afterwards: \"This was a sophisticated operation using a UK Border Agency employee who was supposed to be protecting the UK from these offences.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: UK and EU 'agree text' of draft withdrawal agreement", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46188790", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ministers are to be called in to see the prime minister this evening\n\nUK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement in a significant breakthrough for the talks.\n\nA cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week.\n\nA special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing.\n\nThe prime minister is currently meeting ministers for one-to-one talks as they are given sight of the draft agreement.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Chief Whip Julian Smith are among those who have been seen entering Downing Street.\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell said he had yet to see the detail but he was \"encouraged\" by the progress made.\n\nBut leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, have urged the cabinet to reject the draft agreement -

What does she mean?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019. The reason the UK is leaving is because people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice and what post-Brexit relations will look like. A deal has to agreed by negotiators but also by Theresa May's cabinet, then MPs and, finally, by the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWill there really be a deal this week?\n\nA cabinet source has told BBC the text of the withdrawal agreement has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive talks this week. Theresa May is holding a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the agreement.\n\nWhy is the PM so keen to get a deal by Wednesday?\n\nAny hopes of an EU summit to sign off on a withdrawal agreement this month will apparently be hit if the talks go on much longer - there will not be enough time to set up a meeting of the 28 leaders.\n\nThe next possible date for a meeting of EU leaders is in December, which could result in the Commons vote on any deal being delayed until after Christmas.\n\nWith uncertainty over whether MPs would back a deal, missing this week's deadline would increase the chances of the UK leaving without one. The UK government would then step up no-deal preparations and spending.\n\nWhat were they still arguing about in Brussels?\n\nThe sticking point over the Irish border. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with border posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nBut the two sides have not been able to agree how they can guarantee this - with the EU insisting on a \"backstop\" arrangement which will kick in to avoid a physical border if whatever future trade deal the UK and EU agree does not manage to maintain the current border arrangements.\n\nWhat about a trade deal?\n\nThe two sides are hoping to agree a rough outline of a trade deal to be signed off at the same time as the withdrawal agreement. If all goes as planned, the details will be hammered out after the UK leaves.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nEven if she does get her top team to sign off on a Brexit withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it.\n\nShe does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them.\n\nIf the only choice presented to MPs is her plan or a no-deal scenario it could frighten enough waverers into backing her. Labour and some Tories are trying to ensure other options are put to the vote.\n\nIf she loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope she will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Pound surges on hopes of Brexit breakthrough", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46200297", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:00:44", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe pound has surged against the dollar and the euro amid growing optimism a Brexit deal is close to being agreed.\n\nSterling leapt 1.4% to trade at $1.3036 against the dollar in afternoon trade, whilst against the euro it jumped to a near seven-month high of \u20ac1.1542.\n\nThe move came after a significant breakthrough in talks between UK and EU officials with the draft text of a Brexit deal agreed.\n\nBut analysts warned the pound's rally could be short lived.\n\n\"With the UK Cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans, we are clearly not out of the woods yet,\" said Capital Economics economist Ruth Gregory.\n\nShe said she would not be surprised if a deal wasn't secured until \"well into\" next year, with the pound likely to \"pull back\" again by the end of the year.\n\nPound surges against the dollar\n\nNeil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, was also wary, warning Prime Minister Theresa May still had to convince party members as well as the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.\n\n\"Ms May's proposals are tasked with healing an increasingly divided Conservative party while also keeping the party's DUP allies onside,\" he said.\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments political economist Stephanie Kelly. cautioned this wasn't a \"foregone conclusion\".\n\n\"The devil will be in the detail of the Irish border issue.

According to Prof Godfray he was \"explicitly asked\" not to look at the effectiveness of the current culls.\n\nInstead Prof Godfray and his team drew on the results of the Randomised Badger Control Trials carried out between 1998 and 2007.\n\nNatural boundaries\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nThese showed that culling tended to increase TB in badgers because of increased movement.\n\nIt did, however, find that a reduction of between 12% and 16% in the rate of new cases of cattle TB was theoretically possible, but with significant caveats: the culling had to be carried out over a large area with natural boundaries for between eight to twelve days each year for four years and that more than 70% of badgers had to be killed.\n\nSince culling began in 2013, scientists and campaigners have expressed concerns that the culls that have been rolled out by Defra have not been in accordance with the strict criteria set out by the expert group because they have proved too expensive or too difficult.\n\nThey say that improperly conducted trials could actually increase cattle TB rates.\n\nBut Prof Godfray notes that, in principle, culling is one of the tools ministers have at their disposal and it should be up to them whether its marginal benefit was worthwhile.\n\n\"We conclude that culling does have an effect on the disease. The phrase we use is 'a real but modest effect',\" he said.\n\n\"If nothing else is involved then one would obviously cull, because if one does not cull one is throwing away one of the tools. But of course there are many other factors involved.\"\n\nAnother argument Prof Godfray puts forward in favour of culling is that it makes affected farmers more amenable to carry out unpopular and costly disease control measures on their farms and in transporting their cattle.\n\n\"It is likely that the farming industry would be more willing to accept other interventions that could negatively affect dairy and beef profitability if they believed that the threat of transmission from badgers was being robustly addressed,\" he said.\n\nThe report warns however that continued culling \"would not be acceptable to some (possibly large) sections of the public, and the costs of policing could be substantial\" and says that a shift away from culling is \"highly desirable\".\n\nSpecifically, it emphasises the need for a proper evaluation of badger vaccination.\n\nTesting regime\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nProf Godfray's report also states that infections from cattle to cattle is higher than had been thought, possibly because the current so called skin test used to test for the disease is less reliable than experts once believed. It therefore urges that Defra adopts more sensitive tests.\n\nThe farming minister welcomed the report and said that Defra would give its response by next summer.\n\n''We welcome this review of the government's 25-year Bovine TB strategy and I extend my thanks to Sir Charles Godfray and his team for their hard work in producing the report.\n\n\"Sir Charles' report is an important contribution that will inform next steps in the strategy to achieve officially TB free status for England by 2038.''\n\nProf Rosie Woodroffe of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said that the report had many good ideas but said nothing about the effectiveness of the current badger culls.\n\n\"The report contains little critical evaluation of whether the current farmer-led culls are effectively reducing cattle TB,\" she said.\n\n\"It reports results from the first two years of monitoring without mentioning any of the caveats included by the original authors. It makes no mention of more recent data, which have suggested incidence might be falling in two areas but rising in a third.\"\n\nProf Lord John Krebs from Oxford University, who led the Randomised Badger Control Trials, said that the report indicated that Defra and farmers need to do more if cattle TB is to be stamped out.\n\n\"Currently, much of the spread of TB in cattle arises from a combination of disappointingly low uptake of measures to prevent cattle coming into contact with badgers, trading of infected cattle, and the low sensitivity of the standard skin test for TB, which means that there is likely to be a hidden reservoir of infection in many cattle herds in high risk areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless the government and the farming industry tackle these problems now, TB will not be eradicated or controlled.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mystery monkey: history of unique Xenothrix fossil revealed", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46187670", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The monkey, called the xenothrix, was closely related to the titi monkey which lives in the Amazon\n\nA mysterious extinct monkey from Jamaica that is unlike any other in the fossil record has South American roots, according to new evidence.\n\nDNA extracted from fossilised bones suggests the monkey first colonised the island 11 million years ago.\n\nIt had no predators there and it evolved strange features not seen in living monkeys today.\n\nBut the animal went extinct a few hundred years ago, likely due to hunting and habitat loss.\n\nScientists say the discovery highlights how vulnerable unique island animals are to extinction.\n\n\"It was a really weird animal indeed,\" Prof Samuel Turvey from international conservation charity, Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News.\n\n\"Possibly with legs like a rodent; body maybe like a slow loris.

The problem is what happens to them next.\n\nWet wipes are behind up to 80% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to water companies.\n\nThey say it costs \u00a3100m a year to deal with them.\n\nSkips full of wipes are caught by the filters at water treatment works and end up in landfill.\n\nFrom their treatment sites across the North West, United Utilities collect around 12,000 tonnes of wipes and other rubbish every year.\n\nImage caption Wet wipes causing a blockage at a house on the outskirts of Manchester\n\nTony Griffiths, from United Utilities, said: \"It's extremely frustrating. The amount of money that gets spent on dealing with blockages and disposing of this material could be reinvested in our ageing infrastructure.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we're not spending all this money, we could actually work to reduce customer bills.\"\n\nSome in the water industry are losing patience.\n\nMatt Wheeldon, a director at Wessex Water, has been pushing for action to prevent wipes being labelled as flushable.\n\nHe said: \"I think they're a complete scourge on our society.\n\n\"Whoever came up with the bad idea didn't think about the impact they're going to have on the environment.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"technically illegal to put anything down the toilet that's going to block up the sewer\".\n\n\"Despite what the label says, these wipes definitely shouldn't be flushed down the toilet,\" agrees Natalie Fee, founder of campaign organisation City to Sea.\n\nShe points out that most manufacturers specify that so-called flushable wipes should only be flushed \"one at a time\".\n\n\"Manufacturers clearly know this is a problem. We need to start seeing them change what they say [on the packaging]. It can be confusing for consumers,\" she told BBC News.\n\nDeadly consequences\n\nMeanwhile, wipes which escape the filters have an even greater environmental impact, ending up in rivers and on beaches.\n\nThe wipes contain tiny plastic fibres which go on to harm fish and other marine life as the fibres are released and ingested, sometimes with deadly consequences.\n\nIn addition, the plastic fibres might then go on to be consumed by other animals potentially entering the human food chain.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wet wipes clogging up London sewers\n\nThames21 is an environmental charity which organises clear-ups of wet wipes from the banks of the Thames.\n\nIn the first six months of 2018, volunteers picked up around 120,000 wet wipes from one stretch of the riverbank near Hammersmith Bridge.\n\nAJ McConville, from the charity, said: \"The wet wipes are changing the shape of the foreshore.\n\n\"What seems to be happening is that wet wipes are getting snagged on something, and then they will slow down the water around them by creating turbulence, and by doing that they therefore attract even more wet wipes and more sediment to accumulate around them.\"\n\nImage caption Wet wipes on the riverbed of the Thames at low tide\n\nManufacturers have made efforts to improve the packaging of non-flushable wipes, making the \"do not flush\" logo larger and more prominent.\n\nBut it is the wipes marked \"flushable\" where there is disagreement.\n\nScientists at WRC, a water-testing laboratory in Swindon, carry out tests on wet wipes to assess their ability to disintegrate when they are flushed into the sewers.\n\nThey put wipes into conical flasks full of water and rotate them on a shaking platform - which they believe mimics the turbulence of water conditions in a sewer.\n\nUsing this technique, they have found that none of the wipes marked \"flushable\" which are currently available for sale in the UK pass the test.\n\nThere is hope on the horizon though. They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market.\n\nThe manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly.\n\nSome water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it didn't realistically reflect what happened in the sewers.\n\nImage caption There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as 'flushable'\n\nBut the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked \"flushable\" weren't the problem.\n\nLast year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard.\n\nBut these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.\n\nHear more on Costing The Earth on BBC Radio 4 on 13 November at 15:30 BST, repeated on 14 November at 21:00."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Surgeon General Confirms A Bit Of Blow Here And There Won\u2019t Kill Ya", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/surgeon-general-confirms-a-bit-of-blow-here-and-there-w-1830412735", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON\u2014In a statement marking a reversal of opinion on a previously maligned narcotic stimulant, United States surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams confirmed Tuesday that occasionally indulging in a bit of blow here and there would not, in fact, kill you. \u201cWhile it should go without saying that the surgeon general\u2019s office strongly advises against habitual cocaine use\u2014I mean, c\u2019mon, who are we kidding here, no one wants to be the coke guy, we hate that guy\u2014but the truth of the matter is, if we\u2019re being honest, really, there\u2019s no harm in a little bump when the night starts dragging a little, just to get things rolling again, find your groove, you know, just don\u2019t make your whole weekend about the chop and you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Adams during a press conference originally held to discuss the future of municipal public health in small cities. \u201cYou definitely have to make sure you\u2019re spacing that stuff out.

She also ordered the secretary of state's office to review, or have county election officials review, the eligibility of voters who had to cast a provisional ballot because of registration issues for counties with 100 or more provisional ballots.\n\nTotenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5pm local time (22:00 GMT), which falls before the November 20 deadline set by state law.\n\nState elections director Chris Harvey testified at a hearing last week that the state had planned to certify the election results on Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any necessary runoff contests, including one already projected in the race for the next secretary of state.\n\nUnofficial returns show Kemp with a lead just shy of 60,000 votes out of more than 3.9 million cast; Abrams would need a net gain of about 21,000 votes to force a December 4 runoff.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThe secretary of state's office had said there were an estimated 21,190 provisional ballots cast last week, but the Abrams campaign says that number could be more than 27,000, the Washington Post reported.\n\nProvisional ballots are given to those who showed up to polling places, but their name is not on that precinct's list, or to voters who did not have proper identification. The individual's identity and eligibility are then confirmed before the vote is counted.\n\nVoter suppression claims\n\nTotenberg acted in response to a lawsuit filed on November 5 by Common Cause Georgia. The suit accuses Kemp, the state's top elections official until he resigned as secretary of state last week, of acting recklessly after a vulnerability in Georgia's voter registration database was exposed shortly before the election.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nPrior to the election, Kemp's critics pointed to the 1.5 million voter rolls purged under his watch between 2012 and 2016, according to a watchdog group. An Associated Press investigation also found that his office stalled 53,000 voter applications - the majority of whom were from African Americans - in the lead up to the elections. Abrams is vying to become the US's first black female governor.\n\nAccording to the November 5 lawsuit, Kemp's actions increased the risk that eligible voters could be illegally removed from the voter registration database or have registration information illegally altered. Kemp has denied any allegations of voter suppression.\n\nSara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said in an emailed statement to the Associated Press that the ruling helps increase voter confidence in elections.\n\nThe secretary of state's office was reviewing the order and considering its options, spokeswoman Candice Broce said in an email.\n\nTotenberg's order does not change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results. But Abrams's campaign filed a lawsuit on Sunday asking a federal court to push that deadline to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for \"arbitrary reasons\".\n\n\"I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it. I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,\" Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid.\n\nKemp's campaign retorted that Abrams's latest effort is \"a disgrace to democracy\" and ignores mathematical realities.\n\n\"Clearly, Stacey Abrams isn't ready for her 15 minutes of fame to end,\" said Kemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney.\n\nRaces in Georgia and Florida undecided\n\nThe Georgia race, along with Florida's gubernatorial and Senate matchups that are requiring recounts, is among the final measures of a midterm election cycle that already has allowed Democrats to deal serious blows to President Donald Trump.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nDemocrats won the House, flipped seven governor's seats and reclaimed more than 300 state legislative seats in statehouses around the country. Republicans maintained their Senate majority, and could still expand it. But it's looking to hold the governor's spots in Florida and Georgia to deny Democrats important gains in presidential battlegrounds in advance of the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans have been governor in Georgia since 2003 and in Florida since 1999, and Trump has put a premium on the two states, endorsing both Kemp and Florida's Republican nominee Ron DeSantis when they were in competitive Republican primaries and then campaigning in person for them before the November 6 election."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump: Report of N.

Gathered in the atrium of the AFL-CIO down the street from the White House, they appeared as the newest members of the ascendant House Progressive Caucus, dedicated to universal health care and new climate policy. The incoming majority, including a gain of at least 32 seats, will be fighting a Republican-led\n\nSenate and a president with a history of tweeting trouble for people who displease him.\n\nAnd the newly elected Republicans are on the same side as Trump, at least in theory.\n\nBut for both parties of newcomers, those big questions are for later. The first votes on Pelosi, for example, won't unfold until after Thanksgiving. And the new Congress, the 116th session, doesn't convene until Jan. 3.\n\nNow, for many newcomers, it's a scramble to stand up offices in the warren of Capitol Hill and back home in House districts that each represent more than 700,000 people. Every office has a budget. And every freshman who doesn't already have a home in pricey Washington will have to figure out how to rent an apartment, or maybe just keep a rollaway bed in the office, on a $174,000 salary.\n\n\u201cWe focus on getting them to appreciate that there are certain activities that they have to do in the next 90 days,\u201d said Bradford Fitch, president and CEO of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, which is among those briefing new members.\n\nThe new crop of lawmakers includes a lot of firsts.\n\nFor the first time, two Native American women are headed to the House, in addition to two Muslim congresswomen-elect. Massachusetts and Connecticut also will send black women to Congress as firsts for their states.\n\nBut not every freshman is new to Washington.\n\nRep.-elect Donna Shalala of Florida was health and human services secretary to president Bill Clinton.\n\nFormer NFL linebacker Colin Allred of Texas is a civil rights lawyer who worked in president Barack Obama's housing department. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, is an Obama administration alumnus who served as a civilian adviser in Iraq.\n\nWhatever their background, every newly elected member is heading for a job as one of 435 colleagues in Washington juggling what can sometimes be a seven-day-a-week job of votes, constituent requests and committee meetings. All the while, those who intend to return are already thinking about \u2014 and soon will be fundraising for \u2014 their 2020 re-election campaigns.\n\nBut first things first, Fitch said. At the progressive caucus briefing for new members on Monday, he handed out a 300-page book, \u201cSetting Course: A Congressional Management Guide,\u201d updated for the incoming Congress. It sets out everything from hiring a core staff in November and December to the culture of Congress.\n\nChapter One talks about Dos and Don'ts of these first days. Do learn to delegate, for example.

Sunday sermons in the back of a bar. Pleas to struggling souls to surrender to God. Funerals for members of their flock who didn\u2019t make it.\n\nClergy members have become spiritual first responders in the opioid crisis, often leaving the pulpit to minister on the streets.\n\nThey can be reverends, rabbis, priests or pastors. Though their faiths differ, they invariably approach people with addiction as equals. No Bible-thumping, no blaming. Quite a few are in recovery themselves.\n\nDespite some signs of a slowdown, the nation\u2019s all-time deadliest drug overdose epidemic endures. Opioids were involved in most of the deaths, killing nearly 48,000 people last year.\n\nA spiritual element to recovery is familiar to people who have worked 12-step programs, with their references to an undefined higher power. Scientific studies have found evidence that religious faith can help substance abusers with their recovery.\n\nWorking with addicted people means trips to hospital rooms and fresh graves. But there are flashes of light in the darkness, too.\n\nThree dispatches from the front lines:\n\nA CHURCH FOR IMPERFECT PEOPLE\n\nNine minutes into his sermon, Pastor Brad Hill made a confession.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest. I ask myself a lot of the times, \u2019God, why did you allow me to be an addict?\u201d Hill says from the pulpit of his Grace Downtown Church. \u201cWhy are my friends dying of an overdose? ... I gotta ask God, \u2018Why, God, do you allow this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \u201ca church for imperfect people.\u201d\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \u201cDo those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\u201d\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like this person. There is a way out.\u201d\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man\u2019s grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\u201cThey lost one of ...\u201d Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \u201cThey lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker\u2019s for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They\u2019d drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn\u2019t ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cYou come as you are, whether you\u2019re struggling, or whether you don\u2019t believe, or whether you\u2019re just curious.\u201d\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\u201cI have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI\u2019ve got folks that overdosed the night before. I\u2019ve got folks who have lost everything.\u201d\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peets said.\n\n\u201cSurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you\u2019re your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\u201d he told Peets. \u201cSo what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\u201d\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \u201cCHAPLAIN\u201d on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren\u2019t home or weren\u2019t answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it\u2019s about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \u201cif you save one life, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine\u2019s friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey\u2019s suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he\u2019ll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\u201d\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\u201cI shoot heroin daily,\u201d Sessine explained a few minutes later, \u201cand it\u2019s coming to the point where enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \u201clove people back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend and I, we made a deal,\u201d Casey said, his voice catching. \u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Promise me we\u2019ll never stop getting our hands dirty,\u2019 And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\u201cWhen we approach the people on the street, whether they\u2019re addicted, whether they\u2019re even drunk, or whether they\u2019re high at the moment or they\u2019re a prostitute, whatever\u2019s going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\u201d Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev. Antonio Maria Diez de Medina, the pair greeted men on a street corner, a mom on her front steps and kids on scooters. Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThere been a few times where I\u2019ve come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, \u2018Hi. How are you? How you doing,\u2019\u201d Siniscalchi says. \u201cThey kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\u201d\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets. The rubber-wheeled cart sports a Jesus flag and a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a resonant image in a city with a robust Hispanic population.\n\nAfter two years, the sight of robed men with long beards chatting up people barely draws second glances. Quite a few people chat.\n\nOn one walk, a middle-aged bicyclist asked, \u201cYou guys Catholics or something?\u201d He then had his silver crucifix blessed. A passing woman took a blue plastic crucifix that matched her clothes. At one point, Siniscalchi sat down next to a downcast woman, pulled out a crucifix and told her Jesus loves her.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, looking down.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t matter, he said, Jesus does.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the friars said goodbye to go greet more souls."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Incoming House Members Prep for Dos and Don'ts on The Hill", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-incoming-house-members-orientation/4656614.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Don't hire someone you can't fire, like the son of a campaign donor or the child of the mayor.

And every freshman who doesn't already have a home in pricey Washington will have to figure out how to rent an apartment, or maybe just keep a rollaway bed in the office, on a $174,000 salary.\n\n\u201cWe focus on getting them to appreciate that there are certain activities that they have to do in the next 90 days,\u201d said Bradford Fitch, president and CEO of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, which is among those briefing new members.\n\nThe new crop of lawmakers includes a lot of firsts.\n\nFor the first time, two Native American women are headed to the House, in addition to two Muslim congresswomen-elect. Massachusetts and Connecticut also will send black women to Congress as firsts for their states.\n\nBut not every freshman is new to Washington.\n\nRep.-elect Donna Shalala of Florida was health and human services secretary to president Bill Clinton.\n\nFormer NFL linebacker Colin Allred of Texas is a civil rights lawyer who worked in president Barack Obama's housing department. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, is an Obama administration alumnus who served as a civilian adviser in Iraq.\n\nWhatever their background, every newly elected member is heading for a job as one of 435 colleagues in Washington juggling what can sometimes be a seven-day-a-week job of votes, constituent requests and committee meetings. All the while, those who intend to return are already thinking about \u2014 and soon will be fundraising for \u2014 their 2020 re-election campaigns.\n\nBut first things first, Fitch said. At the progressive caucus briefing for new members on Monday, he handed out a 300-page book, \u201cSetting Course: A Congressional Management Guide,\u201d updated for the incoming Congress. It sets out everything from hiring a core staff in November and December to the culture of Congress.\n\nChapter One talks about Dos and Don'ts of these first days. Do learn to delegate, for example. Don't \u201cskip the House/Senate orientations and party organizational activities.\u201d\n\nAnd don't \u201ctry to do everything.\u201d\n\nDuring this period, \u201cthey don't have to come up with a solution to the Middle East crisis,\u201d Fitch said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Assails France, Macron in Salvo of Tweets", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-assails-france-emmanuel-macron/4656462.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump launched verbal assaults Tuesday on France and President Emmanuel Macron, citing his low voter approval ratings and attacking French tariffs on U.S. wine exports and failure to meet NATO's defense spending goal.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump said first in a salvo of Twitter comments. \"But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\"\n\nTrump has frequently attacked U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the West's main defense alliance forged after World War II, for not yet meeting its 2024 goal of each country spending 2 percent of their national economies on defense, chiefly weapons and armed forces.\n\nEight of the 29 NATO countries are now meeting the 2 percent goal. French defense spending is at 1.82 percent of its gross domestic product, but Paris has announced plans to gradually boost military funding to reach the NATO goal by 2025. By comparison, U.S. defense spending is at 3.1 percent of its world-leading $19.4-trillion economy.\n\nTrump has declared himself a \"nationalist,\" with an America First outlook on international relations. But Macron, with Trump listening nearby at Sunday's centenary of the end of World War I in Paris, deplored rising nationalism throughout the world, declaring it a \"betrayal of patriotism.\"\n\nTrump retorted Tuesday, \"The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so! MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nTrump, whose family business empire includes a Virginia vineyard that sells a variety of wines, also complained about French tariffs on U.S. wine exports.\n\nFrance does charge higher tariffs on U.S. wines, but the monetary difference is relatively small, with five- to 14-cent tariffs on bottles of French wine imported into the U.S. versus 11 to 29 cents on U.S. exported wines headed to France.\n\nSocial media critics of Trump in the U.S. have mocked him for skipping a Saturday visit to a U.S. cemetery of World War I casualties because it was raining. Other world leaders in Paris visited their national cemeteries the same day and Trump White House chief of staff John Kelly, accompanied by other U.S. officials, made it to the American graveyard to lay a wreath honoring the war dead.\n\nBy way of explanation, Trump tweeted, \"By the way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving. Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown. Speech next day at American Cemetary in pouring rain!

Cory Booker worked the phones with Democratic luminaries in Iowa. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock courted high-dollar donors in New York. Other Democrats openly mused about their White House ambitions on live television.\n\nMotivated by an urgency to unseat President Donald Trump and the prospect of a historically large primary field, Democrats see little incentive to delay or downplay their 2020 presidential hopes. Their more transparent approach is upending one of Washington's favorite \u201cwill they or won't they\u201d parlor games and pushed the campaign calendar up earlier than ever before.\n\n\u201cNo one is waiting for anyone in the race to run for president,\u201d said Jim Messina, who managed President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign. \u201cThose days are long, long over.\u201d\n\nRunning for president used to involve a familiar routine, with potential candidates spending months publicly demurring about their ambitions and professing to be content in their current roles. Advisers labored to keep meetings with donors and potential staff under wraps ahead of formal, carefully choreographed campaign announcements.\n\nThis time around, many Democrats believe it would be too risky to wait much longer before making their intentions known, particularly those with lower national profiles who could quickly be overshadowed by a field that could have more than two dozen candidates.\n\nThere are practicalities to consider, given the limited supply of money and top-flight staff available to run a campaign. But another driving factor is more visceral: Democrats are simply eager to take on the president.\n\n\u201cThis is starting very fast,\u201d said former Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Sue Dvorsky. She said that given the imperative to beat Trump, \u201cit kind of needs to.\u201d\n\nTwo long-shot Democrats have already declared their candidacy.\n\nWest Virginia state Sen. Richard Ojeda, a retired Army paratrooper who lost a race for Congress last week, announced his plans to run for president on Monday. Ojeda joins Maryland Rep. John Delaney, who has been running for the Democratic nomination since July 2017, and has already traveled to Iowa 19 times and made 12 trips to New Hampshire.\n\nDelaney said he believes that his early start will help put him at an advantage ahead of would-be rivals.\n\n\u201cWe not only know what the talent is, but they know us and they know about our message,\u201d said Delaney, whose campaign currently has about 10 staffers in Iowa. He expects that number to grow to at least 20 by January and 100 by June.\n\nHigher-profile Democrats have also started to lift the veil on their White House hopes.\n\nOn Monday, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, said he was \u201cseriously looking at\u201d a presidential campaign, saying in an interview that his election to a third term shows \u201ca strong progressive can win.\u201d He called his Senate campaign \u201ca blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nRestoring \u2018moral decency\u2019\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was also up front about her White House ambitions, telling ABC's \u201cThe View\u201d Monday that she was indeed considering a campaign.\n\n\u201cI believe right now every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents, to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans,\u201d Gillibrand said.\n\nUnlike in 2016, when Hillary Clinton's shadow loomed large over the party, Democrats enter the 2020 campaign without a clear favorite. Former vice president Joe Biden occupies the most similar role, with broad name recognition and a deep political network.\n\nBut Biden associates say he is still conflicted about whether to run, and he has pointedly said other would-be 2020 candidates should not defer to his plans. Biden is expected to make a decision by January.\n\nBooker has been among the most aggressive in courting supporters in early-voting states. After the midterms, he called each member of the Iowa Democratic statewide ticket, for whom the New Jersey senator campaigned ahead of the midterm, the day after the election.\n\nBooker was in touch with former Gov. Tom Vilsack, a veteran Democrat in the early-voting state, as well as candidates and operatives in other early-voting states he visited this fall.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, who would be considered an early favorite in the White House race, also called candidates she campaigned for in early-voting presidential states, including Deidre DeJear, who was Iowa's first African-American woman nominated for statewide office but lost in her bid for secretary of state.\n\nMontana's Bullock, who has made several stops in Iowa this year, traveled to New York after Election Day to meet with potential donors. Though Bullock has a lower profile than many possible Democratic contenders, he has an experienced team of political advisers, including chief of staff Tom Lopach \u2014 the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2014 and Nick Baldick, a veteran Democratic strategist.\n\nBullock also sent a staffer to Iowa to work for Tim Gannon, who lost his race for state agriculture secretary last week, a move aimed at giving Bullock an early foothold in the crucial caucus state.\n\nAnd while the midterms showed that Trump remains a powerful force in the GOP, at least two Republicans are considering taking Trump on: retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nKasich will be in New Hampshire on Thursday for a speech at a First Amendment event. Ahead of his remarks, Kasich will have private meetings with several prominent New Hampshire Republicans, including state and county GOP chairs."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Florida Recount Chugs Along as More Irregularities Surface", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-recount-chugs-along-as-more-irregularities-surface/4656494.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Florida\u2019s election recount is chugging along as more irregularities are uncovered and a judge asked the warring sides to \u201cramp down the rhetoric,\u201d saying it erodes public confidence in the election for Senate and governor.\n\nOne county revealed Monday that it had allowed some hurricane-displaced voters to cast their ballots by email \u2014 a violation of state law. Another had to restart its recount after getting about a quarter finished because someone forgot to push a button.\n\nPalm Beach said it won\u2019t finish its recount by the Thursday deadline. And in oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff\u2019s deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, even though a judge said no Republican who has publicly alleged fraud in the county\u2019s process \u2014 a list that includes President Donald Trump and Gov. Rick Scott \u2014 has presented any evidence to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible\u201d in Florida, Trump declared Monday, without elaborating. He demanded that the election night results \u2014 which showed the Republicans leading based upon incomplete ballot counts \u2014 be used to determine the winner.\n\nTrump went on to allege that \u201cnew ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged\u201d and that \u201cballots (are) massively infected.\u201d It was unclear what he was referring to.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered. All 67 counties face a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to finish their recounts.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came just hours before Broward Chief Circuit Judge Jack Tuter held an emergency hearing on a request by Scott\u2019s lawyers that deputies be put in charge of ballots and voting machines that aren\u2019t being used until the recount is over.\n\nAn attorney for Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes described layers of security including keycard and password access to rooms where ballots are kept, secured by deputies and monitored by security cameras and representatives of both campaigns and parties.\n\nScott\u2019s lawyers had alleged in court documents that Snipes was engaging in \u201csuspect and unlawful vote counting practices\u201d that violate state law and that she might \u201cdestroy evidence of any errors, accidents or unlawful conduct.\u201d\n\nThe judge said he could see no evidence of any violations, and said \u201cI am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor\u2019s office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cIf the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit, but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say. Words mean things these days.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s motion was supported by lawyers representing the state Republican Party and opposed by Snipes\u2019 office, Nelson\u2019s campaign and the state Democratic Party. After Tuter told all sides to meet to discuss a compromise, they agreed to add three deputies to the elections office.\n\nMeanwhile, Elections Supervisor Mark Andersen in heavily Republican Bay County told the Miami Herald on Monday that he allowed about 150 people to cast ballots by email, which is illegal under state law. The county was devastated by a Category 4 hurricane in October, and Scott ordered some special provisions for early voting there.\n\nManatee County, south of Tampa Bay, had to restart its recount Monday because a needed button on the machine wasn\u2019t pushed. The error was caught after about a quarter of the county\u2019s nearly 165,000 votes had been recounted, said Michael Bennett, the county\u2019s Republican elections supervisor. It shouldn\u2019t affect the county\u2019s ability to meet Thursday\u2019s deadline.\n\nIn Palm Beach, Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said the county\u2019s 11-year-old tallying machines aren\u2019t fast enough to complete the recount by Thursday. The county is doing the Senate race first and will then do the governor.

Though their faiths differ, they invariably approach people with addiction as equals. No Bible-thumping, no blaming. Quite a few are in recovery themselves.\n\nDespite some signs of a slowdown, the nation\u2019s all-time deadliest drug overdose epidemic endures. Opioids were involved in most of the deaths, killing nearly 48,000 people last year.\n\nA spiritual element to recovery is familiar to people who have worked 12-step programs, with their references to an undefined higher power. Scientific studies have found evidence that religious faith can help substance abusers with their recovery.\n\nWorking with addicted people means trips to hospital rooms and fresh graves. But there are flashes of light in the darkness, too.\n\nThree dispatches from the front lines:\n\nA CHURCH FOR IMPERFECT PEOPLE\n\nNine minutes into his sermon, Pastor Brad Hill made a confession.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest. I ask myself a lot of the times, \u2019God, why did you allow me to be an addict?\u201d Hill says from the pulpit of his Grace Downtown Church. \u201cWhy are my friends dying of an overdose? ... I gotta ask God, \u2018Why, God, do you allow this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \u201ca church for imperfect people.\u201d\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \u201cDo those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\u201d\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like this person. There is a way out.\u201d\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man\u2019s grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\u201cThey lost one of ...\u201d Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \u201cThey lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker\u2019s for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They\u2019d drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn\u2019t ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cYou come as you are, whether you\u2019re struggling, or whether you don\u2019t believe, or whether you\u2019re just curious.\u201d\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\u201cI have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI\u2019ve got folks that overdosed the night before. I\u2019ve got folks who have lost everything.\u201d\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peets said.\n\n\u201cSurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you\u2019re your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\u201d he told Peets. \u201cSo what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\u201d\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \u201cCHAPLAIN\u201d on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren\u2019t home or weren\u2019t answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it\u2019s about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \u201cif you save one life, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine\u2019s friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey\u2019s suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he\u2019ll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\u201d\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\u201cI shoot heroin daily,\u201d Sessine explained a few minutes later, \u201cand it\u2019s coming to the point where enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \u201clove people back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend and I, we made a deal,\u201d Casey said, his voice catching. \u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Promise me we\u2019ll never stop getting our hands dirty,\u2019 And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\u201cWhen we approach the people on the street, whether they\u2019re addicted, whether they\u2019re even drunk, or whether they\u2019re high at the moment or they\u2019re a prostitute, whatever\u2019s going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\u201d Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev. Antonio Maria Diez de Medina, the pair greeted men on a street corner, a mom on her front steps and kids on scooters. Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThere been a few times where I\u2019ve come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, \u2018Hi. How are you? How you doing,\u2019\u201d Siniscalchi says. \u201cThey kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\u201d\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets.

Stressed by this climate change hidden beneath the waves, fish and other marine species are facing enormous disruption.\n\nWhat can you do to try to lighten your effect on these animals? We talked to five people intimately involved with the sea: a Norwegian seafood chef with a locavore emphasis; an explorer fighting to ban fishing in two-thirds of the world's oceans; an environmental scientist concerned about the global boom in aquaculture; an entrepreneur training unemployed young people as \"sea rangers\" to protect marine reserves; and a New England sushi chef who focuses on invasive species.\n\nChristopher Haatuft, chef\n\nSlapping a 13-pound halibut as long his arm on his restaurant counter, Christopher Haatuft slips the tip of his knife in near the gills, then runs the blade tailward to slice off a fillet.\n\nThe snow-white flesh and its delicate texture are a favorite among customers at his Lysverket restaurant in the Norwegian port of Bergen, where Haatuft and fellow \"Neo-Nordic\" chefs are reimagining Scandinavian cuisine.\n\n\n\nBut Haatuft isn't merely concerned with the flavor. He also knows exactly where the halibut was raised: the Glitne farm on a fjord north of the city, which uses land-based tanks to avoid discharging fish waste into the sea.\n\n\"I like using it because it's a progressive way of farming fish,\" said Haatuft, whose arms are emblazoned with tattoos dating to younger days in the punk rock scene. \"I think chefs are starting to get very conscious about where the fish is coming from, and they want to make sure they represent the restaurant well by having sustainable fish.\"\n\nHis latest goal is to persuade langoustine fishermen to sell him the octopuses that stray into their traps instead of killing them and throwing them back.\n\n\"I would love to see the fishing industry at least branch out from the industrialization that's been going on into more artisanal, boutique types of suppliers,\" Haatuft said. \"There's no doubt in my mind that five to 10 years from now, you'll have more specialized wholesale fish suppliers that don't necessarily do mass market, but they do line-caught, very easily traceable fish.\"\n\nEnric Sala, marine ecologist\n\nEnric Sala is fighting for one of the most ambitious goals in the history of conservation: to turn almost two-thirds of the oceans into a marine reserve.\n\nSound like wishful thinking? Sala and his team, working with partners around the world, have persuaded governments to create 19 protected areas in the decade since they launched the Pristine Seas project, which the National Geographic Society calls its largest initiative dedicated to environmental preservation. Added together, these new parks cover waters equivalent to half the size of Canada.\n\nSala believes that the quickest way to begin to buffer the oceans against the effects of climate change would be by banning fishing on the high seas \u2014 the maritime no man's land not under any country's jurisdiction that covers almost half the surface of the Earth.\n\n\"We are in a planetary emergency: Global warming and acidification are going to damage ocean life in a way that we have never seen before,\" said Sala, a former professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"The science is clear, the economics are clear: Protecting the high seas could be the lowest hanging fruit for ocean conservation.\"\n\n\"It's easy to be depressed, but we should be enraged,\" he said. \"We need to redirect this anger, this energy, into positive action.\"\n\nJennifer Jacquet, environmental scientist\n\nMajestic orcas, playful dolphins and gimlet-eyed great whites: These creatures have all cast their spell on generations of ocean lovers.\n\nThe cockles, mussels and clams feeding unobtrusively on the seabed don't tend to ignite quite so much excitement. Jennifer Jacquet believes it's time they did.\n\nJacquet, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at New York University, believes that bivalves could hold the key to reducing pressure on ocean life under siege from fast-accelerating climate change.\n\nHer logic is simple: A global boom in the aquaculture industry is placing an unsustainable burden on the oceans by using vast quantities of wild-caught fish to feed salmon and other farmed carnivores. If the industry switched away from farming carnivorous fish and produced low-impact shellfish and seaweed instead, it would do a lot to ease the pressure, she argues.\n\n\"Our argument is that we need to farm lower on the food web,\" Jacquet said. \"We need to rethink what aquaculture is and will be in the future. Otherwise, it will remain part of the problem \u2014 and the worst part is, people think it's part of the solution.\"\n\nWietse van der Werf, entrepreneur\n\nIt's one of the big wins for environmentalists of the past decade: Governments in many parts of the world have created new marine reserves to protect ocean life. But Wietse van der Werf, who spent years campaigning against illegal fishing in the Mediterranean and North Africa, fears these victories will amount to little if no one is there to keep out the poachers.\n\nA Dutch environmental-activist-turned social-entrepreneur, Van der Werf believes he's found a solution: hire veterans from the navy and marines to train unemployed young people as \"sea rangers\" to patrol areas that governments don't have the resources to cover.\n\n\"The danger is that the legacy that we leave behind as a conservation movement is merely one on paper and it doesn't actually mean anything,\" Van der Werf said. \"The question is: How are you going to monitor these areas?\"\n\nWith backers including a foundation set up by former Google exec Eric Schmidt, his Sea Ranger Service works like this: Young people struggling with long-term unemployment apply for free training as maritime professionals. Applicants attend a five-week \"boot camp\" where one in four is selected to undergo months of training at sea. Once qualified, the crews then, for a fee, perform a wide range of tasks for government agencies, companies and research institutes.\n\nThe first team of 12 Sea Rangers is preparing to set sail next month in the North Sea.\n\n\"The maritime domain is changing very fast,\" Van der Werf said. \"If we're talking about growing food offshore, if we're talking about the energy transition, there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nBun Lai, chef\n\nChef Bun Lai had just cooked a meal of fried inch-long silverside fish and tiny invasive Asian shore crabs along with tempura wakame seaweed, all of which he had harvested from the nearby Long Island Sound earlier in the day. He was sitting at his dining room table, smoking a cigarette.\n\nIt was a jarring contradiction for a man whose restaurant, Miya's Sushi, is renowned for its heart-healthy sushi creations, often made with invasive species of marine life and seaweed as well as weeds scavenged from his overgrown garden. But Lai is a bundle of energetic contradictions.\n\nHe bills his restaurant, a few blocks from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, as the first sustainable sushi restaurant on Earth.\n\nThe menu includes invasive wild boar from Texas, a roll called sushi salaam dedicated to a \"world without violence and retribution,\" as well as a dish with dried crickets emerging from rice.\n\n\"This is our climate-change dish,\" he said. He had formed a six-inch-wide puck of frozen seawater from the Sound. It was mixed with invasive seaweed, also from the Sound, and salt from the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, which is struggling to stay above the rising sea levels. He placed the puck atop a water jug with a candle at the bottom. The puck glowed and cast green shadows onto a thinly sliced island of invasive lionfish.\n\nLionfish is native to Kiribati, Bun said, but the fish he serves was caught in Mexico. After being released into the wild by aquarium owners, the Pacific fish has spread to the U.S. Southeast and throughout the Caribbean. Without any natural predators, it is crowding out many native species.\n\nTo him, serving the lionfish speaks to eating animals and plants in concert with what nature provides rather than forcing nature to provide what we want."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Greater Paris to Ban Old Diesel Cars From Summer 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/greater-paris-to-ban-old-diesel-cars-from-summer-2019/4655978.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "The Greater Paris region will become a low-emission zone from next summer, which will limit the circulation of old diesel cars, the regional authority decided on Monday.\n\nThe Metropole du Grand Paris council said on its Twitter feed it had voted to ban diesel cars registered before Dec. 31, 2000 from the area within the A86 second ring-road, which includes Paris and 79 municipalities around it, a region with 5.61 million inhabitants.\n\nThe ban will use France's new \"Crit'Air\" vignette system, which identifies cars' age and pollution level with color-coded stickers.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nThe death toll from the wildfire that incinerated the town of Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas climbed to 29, matching the mark for the deadliest single blaze in California history. Statewide, the number of fire dead stood at 31, including two victims in Southern California.\n\nOne reason that scientists know that management isn't to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren't \"fuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\" Dennison said.\n\nIn those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said.\n\n\"It's not about forest management. These aren't forests,\" he said.\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled over the level from 30 years ago.\n\nAs of Monday, more than 13,200 square miles (34,200 square kilometers) have burned. That's more than a third higher than the 10-year average.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1999, the United States didn't reach 10,000 square miles burned annually. Since then, 11 of 19 years have had more than 10,000 square miles burned, including this year. In 2006, 2015 and 2017, more than 15,000 square miles burned.\n\nThe two fires now burning \"aren't that far out of line with the fires we've seen in these areas in recent decades,\" Dennison said.\n\n\"The biggest factor was wind,\" Dennison said in an email. \"With wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance of the fires.\"\n\nThese winds, called Santa Ana winds, and the unique geography of high mountains and deep valleys act like chimneys, fortifying the fires, Thornicke said.\n\nThe wind is so strong that fire breaks - areas where trees and brush have been cleared or intentionally burned to deprive the advancing flames of fuel - won't work. One of the fires jumped over eight lanes of freeway, about 140 feet (43 meters), Dennison said.\n\nSouthern California had fires similar to the Woolsey fire in 1982, when winds were 60 mph, but \"the difference between 1982 and today is a much higher population in these areas. Many more people were threatened and had to evacuated,\" Dennison said.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires, Thornicke said.\n\nAnd it's more than trees. Dead shrubs around the bottom of trees provide what is called \"ladder fuel,\" offering a path for fire to climb from the ground to the treetops and intensifying the conflagration by a factor of 10 to 100, said Kevin Ryan, a fire consultant and former fire scientist at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhile many conservatives advocate cutting down more trees to prevent fires, no one makes money by cutting dead shrubs, and that's a problem, he said.\n\nLocal and state officials have cleared some Southern California shrub, enough for normal weather and winds. But that's not enough for this type of extreme drought, said Ryan, also a former firefighter.\n\nUniversity of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flanigan earlier this year told The Associated Press that the hotter and drier the weather, the easier it is for fires to start, spread and burn more intensely.\n\nIt's simple, he said: \"The warmer it is, the more fire we see.\"\n\nFor every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit that the air warms, it needs 15 percent more rain to make up for the drying of the fuel, Flannigan said.\n\nFederal fire and weather data show the years with the most acres burned were generally a degree warmer than average.\n\n\"Everyone who has gardened knows that you must water more on hotter days,\" Overpeck said. \"But, thanks in part to climate change, California isn't getting enough snow and rain to compensate for the unrelenting warming caused by climate change. The result is a worsening wildfire problem."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "5G is Coming, Get Ready", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4656069.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "If you're really lucky and live in the U.S. cities of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles or Sacramento, you now have access to a 5G network.

But as in life, a bit of moderation goes a long way.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life,\u201d she added.\n\nHunt pointed out a few caveats to the study. First, it was done exclusively with 18- to 22-year-olds, and it is unclear if the depressing effects of social media will cross generational lines to older or younger people, Hunt said.

The Magen David Adom medical service said a man in his 40s was found dead under the rubble of a building in Ashkelon.\n\nHe was the first casualty in Israel from the current wave. The man was later identified as a man from Hebron, the West Bank\u2019s largest Palestinian city.\n\nThe eruption of fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war. But he will now be under intense pressure to retaliate given Hamas\u2019 unrelenting rocket barrages.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, marking an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. A 19-year-old soldier was critically wounded and rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation fire quickly ensued.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn Tuesday after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli warplanes, tanks and naval vessels were involved in strikes against military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the attacks \u2014 Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.\n\nHe said the Israeli military has enhanced its deployment along the border but had yet to mobilize its reserves. He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza\u2019s economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers.

Allred/The Deseret News via The Associated Press Mark Rodgers rides an electric scooter in Salt Lake City this summer. Cities and states are trying to figure out how to regulate dockless scooters and whether they should be allowed on streets, sidewalks or both.\n\nBy Jenni Bergal\n\nThousands of new riders have embraced the electric pay-per-minute scooters that have proliferated on America\u2019s streets.\n\nOther people have set them on fire, tossed them off buildings and decorated them with dog droppings.\n\nDepending on your point of view, the scooters are an environmentally friendly convenience or a mechanical menace. One thing is certain: Until now, most states have done almost nothing to regulate e-scooters, in large part because the scooter explosion happened after most legislatures adjourned for 2018.\n\nThat may be about to change.\n\nNext year, at least a dozen states are likely to take up e-scooter measures, according to Douglas Shinkle, who follows transportation issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only about 10 states specifically regulate them now, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on lawmakers\u2019 radar,\u201d Shinkle said. \u201cThere\u2019s controversy and consternation in some communities about where they should operate and whether they should be prohibited from sidewalks.\u201d\n\nThe rules are needed in part to address safety issues. While no government agency keeps national statistics on injuries related to motorized scooters, accidents have spiked. In September, a man riding a rented e-scooter was killed in the District of Columbia in a collision with an SUV.\n\nLast month, nine people filed a class-action lawsuit in Los Angeles County against the nation\u2019s two largest e-scooter rental companies, Lime and Bird, and their manufacturers, accusing them of \u201cgross negligence.\u201d\n\nThree of the plaintiffs claim they were injured by tripping over scooters left discarded on the sidewalk. Others, including a 7-year-old boy who suffered severe damage to eight of his front teeth and had to get his lip stitched back together, say scooters rammed into them from behind as they walked.\n\nThe suit alleges that the companies don\u2019t provide adequate safety instructions for riders and that some scooters\u2019 electronic and mechanical parts are defective.\n\nIn a suit against Bird, Lime and two cities, a California woman who is a paraplegic says the scooters left on sidewalks and curb ramps are creating barriers and hazardous conditions for people with disabilities.\n\nThe companies say their e-scooters are safe and stress that rider safety is a top priority. They typically instruct riders about the rules of the road and other protocols. Lime, for example, requires first-time riders who download the app to flip through a safety tutorial. It also has begun asking riders to sign a pledge to ride responsibly, wear a helmet, abide by traffic laws and ride within designated areas only.\n\nEasy to Use\n\nTo use the two-wheeled kick scooters \u2014 which consist of handlebars, a floorboard and an electric motor \u2014 riders simply download an app on their smartphone, open a map that shows the nearest e-scooter, and pay to unlock it.\n\nBecause many states have no regulations specific to e-scooters, they treat them as motor vehicles or mopeds. That means they\u2019re subject to the same laws that govern those vehicles, even though they typically don\u2019t go more than 15 mph.\n\nIn New York, for example, state law doesn\u2019t address e-scooters, so they technically fall under the category of motor vehicles. But they\u2019re not considered motor vehicles either because they can\u2019t be registered by the Department of Motor Vehicles. And New York City explicitly prohibits them.\n\nThis year, New York state legislators introduced bills in the Senate and Assembly late in the session that would have created definitions and standards for e-scooters, but neither measure made it out of committee.\n\nIn some states, such as Colorado, e-scooters are considered toy vehicles. That means people can ride them on the sidewalk alongside pedestrians but not on the street or in bike lanes, where cities generally prefer them to be.\n\nEmily Warren, senior policy director at Lime, said many cities located in states without appropriate vehicle classifications want to move forward with an electric scooter program, but can\u2019t until legislators act.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of legislatures around the country are going to create new categories for scooters,\u201d she said, \u201c2019 is going to be a big year for this, and we will be pushing for that at the state level.\u201d\n\nExisting Rules Vary\n\nThe San Francisco-based Lime started as a dockless bike-share program in 2017 and expanded to include e-scooters in February. The company now has scooters in more than 40 U.S. cities.\n\nAnother large e-scooter company, Bird, headquartered in Santa Monica, also began in 2017 and now lists more than 70 U.S. cities on its website.\n\nThe states that do have regulations specifically allowing e-scooters have taken different approaches.\n\nIn Virginia, e-scooters can operate on sidewalks unless prohibited by local ordinances.

(Although power imbalances \u2014 and the ability to abuse them \u2014 do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)\u201d\n\nIn a new Vanity Fair essay published Tuesday, Lewinsky again examines this disparity in power as she explains why she decided to relive the painful memories of her experience for a forthcoming documentary series airing on A&E.\n\nCentral to her decision to participate was being able to redefine the narrative about herself, she wrote, noting how Clinton\u2019s position of power has allowed him to escape the same levels of public scrutiny.\n\nA recent example: Clinton\u2019s continued refusal to personally apologize to her and accept responsibility for contributing to her public humiliation, which he demonstrated during a combative interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show in June.\n\nThis summer, Clinton participated in a number of interviews to promote a book with author James Patterson. In several of them, the former president appeared to be caught off guard by questions about the Me Too movement and gave tone-deaf answers, despite Me Too bringing an increased focus on and a re-examination of his affair with Lewinsky, as well as the multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nAs it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\" Monica Lewinsky\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what power looks like, watch a man safely, even smugly, do interviews for decades, without ever worrying whether he will be asked the questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d Lewinsky wrote of Clinton.\n\nIn the \u201cToday\u201d interview, an indignant Clinton asserted to host Craig Melvin that he did not owe Lewinsky an apology. But Lewinsky wrote that the problem with his response was less about the apology directly and more about his insistence that he need not apologize.\n\n\u201cWhat feels more important to me than whether I am owed or deserving of a personal apology is my belief that Bill Clinton should want to apologize. I\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be a better man for it ... and we, in turn, a better society.\u201d\n\nAnother example of the disparate power dynamic, according to Lewinsky, is how at the time of the affair, Clinton\u2019s position of power protected him from experiencing as much public humiliation as she did.\n\nRecalling his infamous Oval Office declaration that he \u201cdid not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d which turned out to be a lie, she said that at the time, she thought it was good that he was not planning to resign.\n\n\u201cForty-five-year-old me sees that footage very differently,\u201d she wrote Tuesday. \u201cI see a sports coach signposting the playbook for the big game. Instead of backing down amid the swirling scandal and telling the truth, Bill instead threw down the gauntlet that day in the Oval Office: \u2018I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\u2019 With that, the demonization of Monica Lewinsky began. As it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\u201d\n\nIn the essay, Lewinsky also explores how our public narratives are often shaped by men, as was the case with the coverage of her and Clinton\u2019s affair \u2014 \u201chistory literally being written by men,\u201d she wrote, explaining that she appreciated that the A&E docuseries \u201cembodies a woman\u2019s gaze,\u201d with a majority of the editors and producers being women."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "How To Talk To Your Kids About Death And Grief", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-death-and-grief_us_5be8eaa4e4b0769d24cecdee", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Cavan Images via Getty Images Death can be a difficult topic for anyone.\n\nDeath and grief are natural parts of the human experience, but mourning a loss is also an incredibly complex process.\n\nWhen a young child loses a loved one, parents often grapple with the challenge of explaining the concept of death and helping their little one through the grieving process (all while grieving themselves).\n\nTo help inform these difficult conversations, HuffPost spoke to a number of child mental health experts. Of course, a family\u2019s cultural and religious background may steer the discussion, but there are certain guiding principles that are helpful for everyone to keep in mind.\n\nHere are some expert suggestions for parents and caregivers when they prepare to talk about death and grief with children.\n\nBe Honest And Straightforward\n\n\u201cTell them the \u2018facts\u2019 about the death,\u201d clinical psychologist John Mayer told HuffPost. \u201cDon\u2019t sugarcoat what death is or use \u2018baby talk\u2019 with a child. Do not use phrases like, \u2018Grammy is sleeping.\u2019 This is an opportune time to teach them about death. Don\u2019t shy away from it.\u201d\n\nBoard certified licensed professional counselor Tammy Lewis Wilborn echoed this sentiment, noting that using \u201ccutesy language\u201d and euphemisms in an attempt to protect kids from the realities of death and loss can actually do more harm than good.\n\nkali9 via Getty Images Avoid using euphemisms when explaining death to children.\n\n\u201cChildren tend to think concretely, not abstractly, so when you use language that\u2019s euphemistic, it can actually be more confusing or frustrating,\u201d she explained. When people say things like \u201cDad is in the clouds\u201d or \u201cYour dad is taking a really long nap,\u201d a young child may not understand the permanence of the fact that their father died and might even look for him in the clouds or expect him to wake up at some point.\n\nWords like \u201cdeath,\u201d \u201cdied\u201d or \u201cdying\u201d may sound harsh, but this is still developmentally appropriate language, Wilborn noted, and it\u2019s important for children to have the language to understand the permanence of death.\n\nAsk And Answer Questions\n\nThe kind of conversation a parent has with a child following the death of a loved one depends on the child\u2019s relationship with the person who died. It should also vary based on the child\u2019s developmental age and their understanding of what happens when someone dies. To that end, it\u2019s useful to ask kids questions or offer to answer any questions they might have.\n\n\u201cStarting with questions can be a way in,\u201d said Wilborn. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t necessarily need to give the specific details of how the person died, particularly if we\u2019re dealing with traumatic grief. They don\u2019t need all of the information, but they need enough age-appropriate details to understand that a person has died and isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents should try to shrink themselves down to the size of their child and walk through what they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\n\nSometimes children may have witnessed something related to the loved one\u2019s death, like being present at the scene of an accident or visiting the person in the hospital. In these cases, they need help understanding what they saw, said Chandra Ghosh Ippen, an expert in early childhood trauma and the associate director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nParents should try to shrink themselves down to the size of their child and walk through what they\u2019ve experienced. Seeing someone in a hospital with tubes coming out of them or watching paramedics perform lifesaving procedures may be frightening for a small child, so it\u2019s necessary for adults to appreciate how scary things might look to them.\n\n\u201cCreate space for them to share how it might\u2019ve affected them, and try to help them understand that doctors and paramedics were trying to help their loved one,\u201d Ghosh Ippen explained.\n\nsot via Getty Images Know that the conversation around death and grieving will be ongoing.\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing conversation. \u201cYoung children will often come back to you after your very excellent explanation of death and still ask, \u2018Am I going to see so-and-so?\u2019\u201d Ghosh Ippen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t understand you, but little kids tend to repeat their questions. It\u2019s sort of their way of mulling it over and making meaning. This can be painful for caregivers, but appreciate that the child did hear you and is just having a difficult time wrapping their head around the concept of death.\u201d\n\nKnow That Their Emotions Are Complicated\n\n\u201cGrief is a complex process, so it comes with a range of thoughts, emotions and behaviors,\u201d Wilborn explained. While parents may expect their child to feel sad, angry, confused or even guilty about a loss, there are other behavioral changes that can be harder to understand, like changes in sleeping and eating patterns or school performance issues.\n\nSometimes parents may feel confused about a perceived lack of sadness in their kids. \u201cYoung children have a short sadness span,\u201d said Ghosh Ippen. \u201cA child can suffer a devastating loss and feel really sad, and then they can go play. You may be thinking, \u2018Were they really affected by what happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile adults tend to immobilize and sink into sadness, kids often discharge it by running around or trying to do something else. \u201cThey kind of go in and out of sadness, and that can put us at odds with them if we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh, my God, do they not care?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cBut recognize that they did care.\u201d\n\n\u201cA child can suffer a devastating loss and feel really sad, and then they can go play. You may be thinking, \u2018Were they really affected by what happened?\u2019\u201d - Chandra Ghosh Ippen, associate director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco\n\nBe Patient\n\nWilborn noted that grief is a long process, so parents should reject the tendency to want to rush past it and wonder when their kids are going to be over it.\n\n\u201cGrief is a process that you cannot go around. You have to go through it. So you need to be OK with the pace of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can take some time for a child to return to his or her normal.\u201d\n\nMayer emphasized the power of this experience and of talking to kids about death as a way to build major developmental coping skills. \u201cThis is a positive and helps them cope with loss in their life in the future and even transitions in their life, such as leaving one school to another, advancing to high school or college, and losing relationships.\u201d\n\nEncourage Expression\n\n\u201cChildren need to see that their parents are a resource; home is a resource where grief is welcome,\u201d Wilborn said, noting that parents should encourage age-appropriate expressions of grief.\n\n\u201cFor example with a school-aged, play is their language, so you want to lean into ways that children play to promote communication \u2015 things like drawing pictures, playing games, dolls, puppet shows at home,\u201d she added. \u201cWith older kids, you might encourage them to journal, draw, write songs, create poems.\u201d\n\nMayer noted that being a resource for your child creates a sense of safety and security that will serve them in later life events. \u201cThey know they can depend on you, and it is wonderful modeling for them.\u201d\n\nCreate Rituals\n\nCreating rituals around remembering and honoring a loved one who died is another significant form of expression. \u201cExplain that this person may not be here with us, but we can still remember him or her and celebrate their life as a family,\u201d said Wilborn.\n\n\u201cWhen the death is really traumatic, sometimes caregivers stop talking about the person who died,\u201d Ghosh Ippen explained. \u201cAnd what\u2019s hard in those cases is that children lose their \u2018angel memories\u2019 \u2015 times when they really felt loved and cared for with that person. It\u2019s normal for grown-ups in mourning to find it hard to talk about the person who died, but it\u2019s important to memorialize them.\u201d\n\nasiseeit via Getty Images Losing a loved one offers an opportunity to talk to your child about your cultural and religious beliefs.\n\nMany cultures and religions promote rituals around saying goodbye and making meaning of death. Mayer noted that losing a loved one presents an opportunity for parents who have religious belief systems to explain these tenets to their children.\n\n\u201cReligious or not, it is also very helpful to teach your children that all the experiences and memories you have had with this loved one do not get erased with their death. People always live in our hearts and our minds forever, and no one or nothing can take that away,\u201d he explained. \u201cSay something like, \u2018Where\u2019s Aunt Susie right now? She\u2019s not in this room with us right now, correct? That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 Aunt Susie is here (point to your head) and here (point to your heart). We have to keep our memories and good times with Aunt Susie alive.\u201d\n\nMake Sure They Know It\u2019s Not Their Fault\n\n\u201cSometimes children have this really uncanny way of assigning blame to themselves for things that have nothing to do with them,\u201d said Wilborn.\n\nWith that in mind, caregivers need to help kids understand that the death is in no way their fault, and it\u2019s not their responsibility to put on a strong face or hide their feelings.\n\n\u201cReligious or not, it is also very helpful to teach your children that all the experiences and memories you have had with this loved one do not get erased with their death. People always live in our hearts and our minds forever, and no one or nothing can take that away.\u201d - clinical psychologist John Mayer\n\nUse Books And Other Resources\n\nThere are many great resources for parents navigating this difficult topic with their children. Ghosh Ippen and Wilborn both recommend Sesame Street\u2019s online grief toolkit, which provides talking points, videos, activities, storybooks and more. Ghosh Ippen and Wilborn also pointed to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network as another great source of online resources.\n\nLittle, Brown Books for Young Readers There are many children's books that cover the experience of loss.\n\nBeyond books and online resources, Wilborn emphasized the value of community resources, such as school counseling, support groups, play therapy and peer counseling.\n\nLet Them See You Grieve\n\nThe way a child\u2019s parents or caregivers respond to a loss is instrumental in helping them cope. \u201cThey need to see you grieve,\u201d said Wilborn. \u201cBut they also need to see you taking care of yourself and engaging in self-care, which may or may not include professional help. If you don\u2019t, they may feel like they have to take care of you because you\u2019re not managing grief in a way that\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s OK to cry in front of your children and show the value of expressing emotions and having shared emotions among family members. It\u2019s OK to say things like \u201cI\u2019m feeling really sad because my dad died\u201d or \u201cDaddy is sad because he misses his mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin our culture, we often have a sense that we have to be tough, so many parents are trying to help their kids by putting on a brave or overly cheery face,\u201d said Ghosh Ippen. \u201cBut that can seem really odd and confusing. The child is feeling sad because it\u2019s devastating that this person is gone, but then the parent is cheery \u2015 which can feel eerie and weird.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about conveying the idea that \u201cMom is sad, and Mom is also strong,\u201d she continued. If the feelings of grief become overwhelming, parents should seek help from other sources because it\u2019s not their child\u2019s role to help them."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This Is Why Many Veterans Aren't Getting The Care They Need", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/too-few-doctors-and-nurses-for-veterans-in-some-areas_us_5be9c225e4b0641e69d4e5b6", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Dan Elliot/The Associated Press Bridget Villegas, a medical support specialist, at an operating room in a Veterans Health Administration medical center in Aurora, Colorado. Colorado had one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of staffing vacancies for VHA facilities.\n\nBy Tim Henderson\n\nAs the nation marks Veterans Day, many veterans in rural areas and some cities still face long wait times for health care because there aren\u2019t enough doctors, nurses and support staff to provide it.\n\nAlmost 40,000 of the 335,000 positions in the Veterans Health Administration are vacant, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which oversees the VHA. The VHA serves about 9 million veterans.\n\nThe VHA\u2019s turnover rate is less than half the rate for the health care industry overall.\n\nHowever, a Stateline analysis of recently released federal figures shows the VHA has a severe vacancy problem in high-cost urban areas such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and in largely rural states, such as Montana and Colorado.\n\nMontana and Colorado have the highest state job vacancy rates at more than 20 percent, followed by Utah, Oklahoma and Maryland. At the other end, vacancies in Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Rhode Island are less than 8 percent.\n\nIn some ways, the challenges facing the VHA are the same ones facing the health care workforce as a whole, especially in rural areas like Montana, said Kristin Mattocks, a Montana native and associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who has studied VHA efforts to improve care for veterans.\n\nNationally, job openings in the health care sector have nearly tripled to 1.1 million since 2010, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Most of the communities with shortages of health care workers are in rural areas, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are also shortages in Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\nAs more doctors and other providers in the VHA and elsewhere have been retiring, there\u2019s more pressure on the remaining doctors to absorb more patients and speed up appointments.\n\n\u201cNow the pressure is put on physicians, which is probably driving some folks\u201d away, Mattocks said.\n\nThe vacancy rates, detailed in a new report required by legislation Congress approved this year, can cause long wait times for appointments, create waitlists for artificial limbs and lead to unsanitary conditions.\n\nMost of the nearly 40,000 vacancies are for medical and dental staff such as doctors and nurses. Those professionals are hard to find and keep because VHA\u2019s hiring process is time-consuming and the pay is lower than in the private sector.\n\nAnd because there isn\u2019t sufficient support staff, many VHA doctors say they are frustrated by having to do more paperwork and even clean offices, federal audits have shown.\n\nIn Colorado last year, the Denver Post found that the VHA postponed surgeries because it didn\u2019t have enough anesthesiologists. Understaffing led to dirty storage rooms and canceled surgeries for anesthetized patients at the VHA\u2019s flagship hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd veterans in Connecticut had a hard time getting appointments for counseling because four key jobs were vacant earlier this year. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, in a September hearing called the vacancy figures \u201creally staggering.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal added that leaders of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter had complained that care was held up at a Norwich, Connecticut, clinic because the local office lacked a director, a case manager, an outreach coordinator and a counselor.\n\nAt the same hearing, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie also expressed alarm about the number of vacancies. And he said hiring for mental health centers such as the one in Connecticut is a priority.\n\n\u201cOn its face it is staggering,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cIf we tried to fill all 40,000 we\u2019d never get where we need. \u2026 We have to concentrate on, I think, four areas: primary care, internists, mental health workers and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nHe added that this year\u2019s Mission Act legislation, which President Donald Trump signed in June, will give him more power to raise pay and forgive student loans to attract more medical professionals.\n\nThe agency has stepped up hiring in the past two years, Wilkie said, in response to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report that found that VHA lost an increasing number of employees each year between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIn the five clinical occupations with the worst shortages, including physicians, registered nurses and psychologists, VHA\u2019s employee losses grew from about 5,900 in 2011 to about 7,700 in 2015. Voluntary resignations and retirements were the primary drivers.\n\n\u201cVHA remains fully engaged in a fiercely competitive clinical recruitment market,\u201d the agency said in a statement about the vacancy data. The VA did not respond to requests from Stateline for further comment.\n\nStaffing vacancies have contributed to recent scandals involving long wait times for care \u2014 some veterans died while waiting for appointments \u2014 and the falsifying of wait-time data to deflect scrutiny.\n\nHiring woes continued into 2017, a GAO report said, in part because a federal hiring freeze ordered by Trump limited the agency\u2019s ability to hire doctors. Doctors were exempt from the freeze, but there weren\u2019t enough personnel workers to recruit and hire them, the report concluded, and some were not well-trained to do the job.\n\nThe shortage of trained recruiters undermines the VHA\u2019s effectiveness, the report stated, and \u201cimpedes its ability to improve delivery of health care access to veterans.\u201d\n\nA 2016 report from the congressionally appointed Commission on Care found that VHA doctors and nurses were cleaning offices and doing paperwork because of inadequate numbers of support staff. The commission also detailed a scandal over employees falsifying wait times for service, and some deaths of veterans on waitlists. An understaffed Phoenix administration system struggled to meet a target of 14-day maximum wait times for appointments.\n\nThe report pointed to \u201cstaffing shortages and vacancies\u201d at every level. It also said VHA salaries aren\u2019t competitive, and that the agency \u201ccontinues to use a talent management approach from the last century.\u201d\n\nOther reports have described the effects of those shortcomings. In Washington, D.C., the VA inspector general found conditions so chaotic that sometimes doctors had to borrow equipment from other hospitals during treatment, and surgery was postponed because equipment was discovered missing or broken after the patient was anesthetized. Employees told inspectors the problems were caused by a support staff shortage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, this fall called VHA staffing shortages the most critical issue facing the agency, saying the high rate of vacancies in Montana and elsewhere is hurting care for veterans.\n\n\u201cI continue to hear from veterans across Montana and elsewhere that vacancies and constant turnover in VA facilities impacts how quickly they can get appointments and prevents them from building quality doctor-patient relationships,\u201d Tester, who is running for re-election, wrote in a September letter to Wilkie.\n\nU.S. Sen. Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington state, told Wilkie at the hearing that the fast-growing Seattle area has been particularly hard hit by service shortages. A clinic on the Kitsap Peninsula, west of Seattle, took years to approve and build and will likely be at capacity when it opens next year, Murray said.\n\nNearly a quarter of the staff positions were vacant at VHA facilities in Washington, D.C., and Augusta, Georgia, as of July. But U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican who sponsored the Mission Act, said this fall that things seem to be improving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten letters from my district, unsolicited, veterans who used to write me about how we weren\u2019t worth anything because we couldn\u2019t get anything done, [now] thanking me for the efficient way the operation works now,\u201d Isakson said at the September hearing.\n\nWilkie, who was confirmed this year, called the job vacancy data \u201can important step in transparency\u201d but stressed that some vacancies are normal and that some represent new positions created to anticipate future growth. Also, Wilkie said, time to complete a specialist referral has fallen from 19 days in 2014 to about one day this year.\n\nThe agency publishes current wait times for appointments, and some facilities with high vacancy-rates have long waits for appointments: The Augusta, Georgia, veterans hospital had a 34-day wait for primary care. Chillicothe, Ohio\u2019s hospital, with one of the country\u2019s lowest vacancy rates, had only a six-day wait.\n\nBut average wait times are high even in some hospitals with low vacancies \u2014 the Honolulu hospital has only about a 2 percent vacancy rate, the lowest in the country, but its average wait time \u2014 39 days \u2014 is one of the highest."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "HBO's \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019 Discriminates Against Blind People", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hbo-discriminates-against-blind_us_5be073e1e4b04367a87f1cab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "I\u2019ve watched the trailer for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d the first installment of HBO\u2019s adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, about 30 times.\n\nI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019ve been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up.\n\nBut the reason I get emotional doesn\u2019t have so much to do with the fact that it\u2019s a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease \u2014 a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be able to watch the series.\n\nFerrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means it\u2019ll be entirely in subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as \u201cRome\u201d and \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d had English dialogue.\n\nBut I can\u2019t read subtitles. I can\u2019t even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someone\u2019s help or a magnifier. I also can\u2019t read street signs, which caused me to lose my driver\u2019s license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. It\u2019s a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities.\n\nMany people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who can\u2019t see well what is happening on the screen.\n\nPeople with low vision don\u2019t use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as I\u2019m sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO won\u2019t be including audio description for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d though.\n\nWith HBO\u2019s decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as it\u2019s been in existence.\n\nHBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions.\n\nSnyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the script\u2019s action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue.\n\n\u201cA skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful,\u201d he told me.\n\nThough it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d told me that isn\u2019t the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series \u201cNarcos,\u201d a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\nBut after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner.\n\nSo, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldn\u2019t HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m new to being ostracized by HBO because \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cMonica & David,\u201d a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married \u2014 because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it.\n\nCould you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind?\n\nThe decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like they\u2019re socially inept. \u2026 They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone?\u201d\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nThe network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO won\u2019t budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company.\n\nHBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels \u2014 the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels \u2014 to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA.\n\nA representative from the FCC told me that HBO\u2019s Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description.\n\nInterestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThat, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "16 Gifts For Fitness Enthusiasts Who'd Rather Be Working Out", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fitness-gifts-for-fitness-lovers-him-her_us_5be8b0d8e4b0e843889944eb", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "DisobeyArt via Getty Images\n\nThey wake up at the crack of dawn, schedule workouts in-between work meetings and book hotels based on their proximity to gyms and studios.

What first drew us together was our love of style. That night I chatted so openly with him because I believed he was gay. He was wearing a purple Lanvin suit with a floral tie, a polka-dotted pocket square and striped socks. I couldn\u2019t believe that a man who dressed so well could actually be straight.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after our third \u201cdate\u201d (he wore a blue window-paned suit and red shoes) that I began to realize that he wasn\u2019t interested in being my stylish gay friend, but my stylish boyfriend.\n\nEverything blossomed. We spent weekends vintage shopping, he flew out to join me when I traveled for work, he would stay over at my place for days on end. But something was amiss. He never wanted me to visit his apartment.\n\nI wondered what he was hiding \u2014 a second family, a love of taxidermy, a mother? It all seemed especially odd as this man with such incredible personal style would surely live in the chicest of pads.\n\nTalking him into inviting me over was a lengthy process. He swerved my requests constantly or offered frustrating platitudes like, \u201cOne day, darling.\u201d I could see that it was a sensitive subject for him and, not wishing to rock the love boat, I allowed this dynamic to continue for an entire year before something inside me snapped.\n\nI had an upcoming day filled with Manhattan-based appointments and I asked him if I could use his apartment between meetings rather than schlepping back to my Brooklyn pad in between. I saw the dodge coming as he began to shift in his chair. I broke, my request turning into an infuriated demand. This time he relented. He stood up from his chair and gathered his coat and bag, claiming he needed to \u201ctidy the place up a little\u201d before I arrived the next day. I wondered if I\u2019d ever see him again, but I had his address, or at least the address he\u2019d given me.\n\nEntering the building, I was greeted by a doorman. This boded well. I rode the elevator to the seventh floor and as I stepped out and moved along the corridor, Richard\u2019s face appeared through the crack of an apartment door.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t judge me,\u201d he quietly pleaded.\n\n\u201cOf course I won\u2019t judge you, how bad can it be?\u201d I responded.\n\nStepping inside, I was met by a scene reminiscent of the TV show \u201cHoarders.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried about me saying anything because words truly failed me. The blinds were drawn and no lights were on, but in the darkness I could make out very little floor space underneath endless piles of\u2026 stuff. He had to guide me through it by the hand. He led me into the small galley kitchen, which resembled a community theatre set of a 1980s kitchen. Faux-wood laminate cabinets hung off the walls at crooked angles and a fridge that had presumably once been white was gray. The \u201cMad Men\u201d-style apartment I\u2019d envisioned had been replaced with the reality that this was the apartment of an actual madman.\n\nNone of it made sense. This was a man who matched his eyeglass frames to his socks. This was a man who agreed that leopard print was a neutral. This was a man who once suggested I\u2019d look good in red, to which I scoffed, tried on the red dress he\u2019d picked out, twirled before the mirror and wore the dress to a party the very next day. This was a man of exquisite tastes. Or was he?\n\nFive minutes in that storage-unit-masquerading-as-an-apartment was all I could manage the first time, but I\u2019m no quitter. I came back the next day and made the first of what would turn out to be a string of demands. This one was simple: Turn the lights on.\n\nWith the full scope of the situation revealed to me by a flickering overhead light, I wasn\u2019t really sure how to react. I was horrified, but so was he. What could I say that he didn\u2019t already know? I was standing in the smoldering ruins of a marriage, a compulsive shopping habit stemming from his diagnosed OCD, and a giant relationship hurdle I wasn\u2019t sure I could clear. We shut the door on the apartment and I didn\u2019t return for a month.\n\nHumans are very adaptable, and it\u2019s true that you can get used to anything given enough time. Little by little, I started to stay over at his chaotic apartment. I couldn\u2019t find anything in the mess so it meant that I was waited on hand and foot by my continually embarrassed boyfriend. The surroundings were insufferable, but it was fun to be brought coffee and sandwiches as I tapped away on my laptop in the middle of the bed, the only area that was clear.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Ruthie Darling\n\nIf outwardly I was understanding, inside I was plotting. I just needed a window of opportunity to enact my dastardly plan, and that moment arrived one weekend when Richard announced he\u2019d be heading out of town for the day to visit his family. I knew what this meant for me: hours alone in this nightmarish place and access to cleaning products. What I was planning was risky, but someone needed to break the hex on this apartment. I didn\u2019t have a sage stick, but I did have Fantastik.\n\nAs he left the apartment he eyed me suspiciously. \u201cThere\u2019s coffee in the pot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGreat. Should I ever find it, I\u2019ll drink it,\u201d I replied with a wink.\n\nHe sighed and moved toward the elevator wearing an eggplant-colored vest over a Pucci shirt with burnt-orange pants, an ensemble only he could pull off so nonchalantly. As the apartment door clicked shut, I spun around like a Bond villainess. I think I was actually rubbing my hands together.\n\nIt took me 45 minutes to locate the vacuum cleaner, but once I found it I was cleaning those floors like a drugged-up 1950s housewife. I put clothes in the closets, I put books on shelves and wiped years of dust off of old photo frames. Anything clearly garbage was bagged up and slowly but surely, parquet floor tiles began to emerge before me.\n\nI wish I could say that my cleaning spell resembled one of those montage scenes in the movies, the kind where we see a whirlwind of activity underscored by Survivor\u2019s \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and that ends in a sparkling apartment. Alas, this would take more than one afternoon, plus I\u2019d run out of Windex.\n\nLater that evening, when I heard the key in the lock, I braced myself. I had no idea what his reaction would be. I hoped he\u2019d fall to his knees in gratitude, but I\u2019m a realist and change is hard.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d was his first question, his face full of anxiety. \u201cI had a system! How will I find anything now?\u201d\n\nI almost laughed, but thought better of it. An evening of sulking and heavy sighing on his part ensued, and I figured I had gone too far. I left for my own apartment that night and realized that my actions were perhaps invasive and cruel. I sent an apology text that went unanswered. Concerned for the state of our relationship, I returned to his apartment the next day with a rehearsed apology speech, only to run into him in the lobby pulling a handcart piled high with boxes. He smiled at me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking all of these to Housing Works,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since my \u201ccleaning spell\u201d and progress has been made. Not only can we now walk about without falling over things, but some treasures have been unearthed.\n\nOne thing I will say in praise of never throwing anything away is that his apartment is truly a museum of his life, even if mostly the life he had before we met. I\u2019ve spent evenings with him reading through sweet love letters from 30 years ago, leafing through his art school projects and holding old slides up to the (now clean) windows. We even found an article a former girlfriend had written about him in Cosmopolitan in 1981 titled \u201cThe Terribly Tidy Man.\u201d The irony was not lost on us, and I\u2019m considering contacting her to collaborate on a before and after book.\n\nI know more about Richard through sifting the contents of his apartment than I ever could have hoped to by simply hearing him reminisce. Though photos of his ex-wife now reside in drawers, I would never have him throw them out. He loved her once, and who am I to discard love?

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013.

The budget from Rome is the first real, and not just rhetorical, assault on the establishment order of the bloc.\n\nThe question is whether the budget is a serious stimulus plan or a bank-breaking populist giveaway larded with tax cuts, pension benefits and welfare programs that neither Italy nor the European Union can afford.

I objected, but he insisted that the caffeine doesn\u2019t affect him, meaning it doesn\u2019t disturb his sleep.\n\nBut when I noticed how easily he became upset or angered by minor irritations many times a day, I decided to look into what is known about the bodily effects of so much caffeine and whether it might contribute to the harmful effects of stress on the heart.\n\nCaffeine is by far America\u2019s leading nonprescription drug, regularly consumed by some 90 million adults each day in coffee, tea, soft and energy drinks and some prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n\nAmounts can range widely. An 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee may contain 95 to 165 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of instant coffee delivers 63 milligrams. One ounce of espresso has 47 to 64 milligrams; 8 ounces of brewed black tea, 25 to 48 milligrams; 8 ounces of brewed green tea, 25 to 29 milligrams; 8 ounces of cola, 24 to 46 milligrams, whereas a 12-ounce energy drink can contain as much as 300 milligrams. Much smaller amounts of caffeine can be found in chocolate, decaffeinated coffee, some candies and even some foods like waffles."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "F.D.A.

None of the major tobacco companies would comment on the possibility of barring menthol cigarettes at this early stage.\n\nBut such a move has been long-awaited by public health advocates, who have been especially concerned about the high percentage of African-Americans who become addicted to menthol cigarettes.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency\u2019s commissioner, would not comment publicly on the proposal on Friday.

Its device resembles a flash drive, and has had a stunning appeal among youths ever since it was introduced.\n\nDr. Gottlieb focused on Juul and several other major e-cigarette makers in September, warning them to stop marketing to teenagers or risk being banned. He set a 60-day deadline for the major companies to prove they could keep their devices away from minors, and that timetable ends this weekend.\n\nAt the same time, the F.D.A. also warned 1,100 retailers to stop selling the devices to minors, and issues fines to some of them.\n\nThe latest actions follow months of meetings between the F.D.A. and e-cigarette makers over how to prevent teenagers from getting hooked on their products.\n\nJuul, which has more than 70 percent of the nation\u2019s e-cigarette market and has become ubiquitous in many high schools and middle schools, submitted thousands of pages of marketing documents and related materials. But the regulators, not satisfied, then visited the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters in September and seized more.\n\nThe four other products facing the 60-day deadline were RJR Vapor Co.\u2019s Vuse, Imperial Brands\u2019 blu and devices made by Logic. None of the companies responded to immediate requests for comment.\n\nRJR, Imperial and Altria are all major tobacco companies, which along with other industry heavyweights have viewed e-cigarettes as critical to their survival now that smoking rates have declined to their lowest levels in the United States."}]
