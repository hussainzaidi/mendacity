A tariff battle with China is highlighting a growing great power rivalry. And Russia's role as a top energy producer with a vested interest in setting global oil prices could open new fronts in a widening confrontation between Washington and Moscow.\n\nThe President's Twitter account is usually a reliable guide to his frustrations and grievances, and apart from a tribute to George H.W. Bush on the day of his funeral, Trump's feed pulsated with concern Wednesday about market moving events.\n\nHe effectively dared ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in Vienna not to cut production, a move that could reverse a period of lower oil prices and compromise the effectiveness of new US sanctions imposed as part of a new hardline policy on Iran.\n\n\"Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!\" Trump wrote.\n\nBut most analysts expect OPEC to cut production by up to 1.5 million barrels a day to reverse a glut partly triggered by a previous US request to pump more oil as a cushion against the impact of the new sanctions on Iran.\n\nSuch a move could not only spark further volatility of global markets, it could push up the cost of gas in the United States, ending a period of lower pump prices welcomed especially by lower income workers in rural areas key to Trump's political base.\n\nAn OPEC production cut could also cast doubt on the effectiveness of one of Trump's most controversial foreign policy moves -- holding Saudi Arabia close despite the suspected role of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, in the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.\n\nTrump is under extreme pressure in Congress for standing by MBS and support is building among lawmakers for a ban on arms sales and new sanctions against the kingdom. Trump, however, partly justified his refusal to cut the Saudis loose by noting their importance in global oil markets.\n\n\"Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!\" Trump tweeted on November 21.\n\nStanding by the Saudis\n\nTrump last month explained his solidarity with the Saudis in the plainest expression yet of a foreign policy approach rooted in the idea that traditional US concerns about human rights should be superseded by a drive to maximize commercial advantage from the nation's foreign relationships.\n\n\"We're not going to give up hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and let Russia and China have them ... it's a very simple equation for me. I'm about make America great again,\" the President said.\n\nBut Trump's domestic exposure on Saudi Arabia is only getting worse.\n\nSenate Republicans are now in open and rare revolt against the Trump White House, raising the possibility that a veto-proof majority may exist to override any attempt by the President to exert control over Saudi policy.\n\nTop Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham accused the Saudis of being a \"wrecking ball\" that is jeopardizing US security interests in the region.\n\nTrump critics who believe the President's Saudi policy is also being influenced by his own business interests will seize on a Washington Post report Wednesday that lobbyists representing the kingdom paid for an estimated 500 nights in his Washington DC hotel over three months shortly after he was elected.\n\nDemocrats plan to probe any financial links between Trump and the Saudis when they take control of the House of Representatives in January.\n\nMBS might feel beholden to US requests to limit oil production cuts, given the President's public and constant support at a time when the Saudi prince is being ostracized across the world. But though it is hugely influential, Saudi Arabia cannot control what OPEC does.\n\nThe oil-producing Canadian province of Alberta for instance has announced it will cut production to reverse over supply that has lowered Canadian crude prices.\n\nAnother important influence in OPEC is Russia, which is not a member of the organization but has shown signs it is willing to join in a cut in production.\n\nGiven the importance of high oil prices to Russia's economy and increasing geopolitical strains with the US, exacerbated by Trump's decision to cancel a meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Argentina over the weekend, Moscow may be in no mood to throw the US a political bone.\n\nTrump also anxious about China duel\n\nThe oil price puzzle and the temporary halt to a tariff war that Trump negotiated with China's President Xi Jinping during the weekend G20 summit exemplify the gamble Trump often takes with his unorthodox global leadership.\n\nA deepening trade war with China and rising oil prices, in defiance of US demands, could have knock-on effects that could weaken Trump's political support, his argument that Americans are better off under his leadership and damage strong economic growth -- his best argument for a second term.\n\nChina's reprisals to billions of dollars in tariffs imposed on its exports have, by design, disproportionately targeted areas on which Trump is counting for support in 2020, including agricultural states like Iowa that he won in 2016.\n\nSo while lambasting China on the campaign trail and accusing the Asian giant of stealing US industrial jobs made for a strong message in the Midwest, the measures Trump used to make good on his promises have had a political cost.\n\nTrump's Twitter feed again betrays his current obsessions -- he has tweeted about his trade deal with Xi seven times in just the last 36 hours. His effort was part of a damage control bid by the President and other senior officials to bolster an agreement with the Chinese that seems in retrospect to be even less comprehensive than it initially appeared.\n\n\"Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\"Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!\"\n\nVery strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2018\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped nearly 800 points on its most recent day of trading Tuesday as investors realized that the agreement between Trump and Xi may not stave off hostilities for long.\n\n\"This tariff situation still looms large over the market,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, China moved to ease some of those concerns after its initial reticence to offer details of what it had signed up to rattled the markets and angered Trump.\n\nBeijing belatedly recognized a 90-day clock for talks and reaffirmed its willingness to implement \"already-agreed-on specific points as quickly as possible\" a move that Trump noted when he tweeted about \"very strong signals.\"\n\nThe White House also says the deal with Xi will see China buy large amounts of US agricultural produce to close the trade deficit and includes an agreement by Beijing to curtail the flow of fentanyl, a powerful opioid, into the US.\n\nIn return, Trump agreed to hold off on plans to raise all current tariffs to 25% on January 1.\n\nAfter frequently boasting about a bull run during most of the first two years of his presidency, Trump has shown recent signs of concern about the optics of plunging stock markets that have now given up most of the year's gains.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that Trump had soured on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin partly owing to stock market volatility, his support for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and a more conciliatory approach to China than some hawkish White House advisers.\n\nTrump denied the report, but it added to the impression that the President is increasingly concerned about how the economic turbulence abroad could weaken his political viability at home."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "The slow-motion disaster of Trump's Khashoggi strategy", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/X67O9kis68k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Shortly before 1 p.m. on Tuesday, having just received a classified briefing from the director of the CIA in the basement of the Capitol, two Republican senators stepped to a crowd of cameras and reporters. With a few pointed words, the pair blew up the Trump administration's efforts to minimize the political damage stemming from journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said, referencing allegations that Saudi operatives dismembered Khashoggi's body after killing him in October inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican took aim at the White House's insistence that U.S. intelligence agencies had no direct evidence linking the murder to Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, even though it was carried out by members of his inner circle. \"You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the command of MBS.\"\n\nNearby, Republican Sen. Bob Corker told reporters there was \"zero question in my mind\" that MBS was behind the killing. \"If he was in front of a jury,\" said the Tennessee Republican, \"he would be convicted in 30 minutes, guilty.\"\n\nFrom the early leaks of its gruesome details to President Donald Trump's muted responses to Tuesday's full-throated rebuke from Republican senators, the Khashoggi murder has been an exercise in political mismanagement and discord. What could have been an opportunity to craft a unified American response has devolved into a political standoff, laying bare divisions among the White House, the intelligence community and Congress.\n\nFor weeks the Trump administration has tried to separate the crown prince from the horrific murder. It's also sought to frame the broader issue as a binary choice of either getting in line with its defense of Saudi Arabia or taking the risk of cutting off relations with one of America's closest partners in the Middle East. Even for national security hawks like Lindsey Graham, who is among the President's closest allies in Congress and is himself a long-time supporter of Saudi Arabia, that has been a bridge too far.\n\nThe Khashoggi murder has also worsened the tension between the White House and Congress over America's support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, which has turned into a full-blown humanitarian crisis, forcing an administration pushing for a cessation in the conflict -- and deeply opposed to congressional meddling on the issue -- onto its heels.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials reveal a deep frustration and anger over what many describe as the administration's bungled response, at home and abroad, to a searing murder that raises questions over the nature of America's alliance with the Saudis and US claims of moral leadership in the world.\n\nLast week, in an attempt to contain the growing outrage, the White House dispatched its two most prominent Cabinet officials to Capitol Hill. But the visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis appeared to do more harm than good.\n\nRather than getting a direct brief from CIA director Gina Haspel, as many had requested, lawmakers got a limited version that emphasized a technical distinction that the CIA had no direct proof that MBS had ordered Khashoggi's murder, despite the fact that the CIA rarely includes direct proof in its assessments.\n\nIt didn't help that lawmakers woke up that morning to a hardline op-ed by Pompeo in the pages of the Wall Street Journal. In it, Pompeo criticized \"the Capitol Hill caterwauling and media pile-on\" the murder had elicited, and equated critics of the Saudis with supporters of President Barack Obama's Iran deal -- a sentiment that, according to one senior GOP aide, landed \"like a lead balloon.\"\n\nThe frustration led to a bipartisan revolt for all to see, live on the floor of the US Senate. Minutes after Pompeo and Mattis left, a majority of senators, including 14 Republicans, voted to advance a resolution to curtail US support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen -- a resolution that had failed in March, and that Pompeo and Mattis had urged them to reject.\n\nA week later, Graham landed his own op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, in which he defended Congress' right to oppose the administration in order to \"safeguard the country's long-term interests, values and reputation.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Graham wrote, \"someone's got to do it.\"\n\nLeaks and infighting\n\nFor its part, the administration has condemned the murder and imposed sanctions on 17 individuals linked to it. At the same time, Trump and top administration officials have consistently cited the historic alliance between the two countries, and framed allegations of MBS's involvement as an attack that could threaten the relationship. It has rationalized that stance with what it claims is the lack of a final conclusion by the CIA on the question of whether MBS directed the murder.\n\nBut that rationale has deteriorated as a steady drip of details related to the CIA's assessment of the murder have painted an increasingly damning picture related to the crown prince's potential involvement.\n\nLast month, the CIA delivered a report on the murder to lawmakers in the \"Gang of Eight\"-- the chairmen and top Democrats on the two Intelligence Committees and the four House and Senate party leaders. When details leaked, including that the CIA had determined with a high degree of confidence that MBS directed the killing, Trump and White House officials blamed the CIA for briefing too many people, according to several US officials. In turn, members of the intelligence community were angry over the way that Haspel was thrust into the middle of a political fight between the White House and Congress.\n\nLast week as Pompeo and Mattis visited the Hill, Haspel's absence took center stage following lawmakers' claims that the White House blocked her from appearing. The CIA issued a rare on the record statement rebutting that, saying \"the notion that anyone told Director Haspel not to attend today's briefing is false.\" And multiple US officials pointed out that her preference all along was to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nWhile there is no indication that the administration told Haspel explicitly whether or not she could attend, several sources have noted that the White House had made clear, even if not directly to Haspel, that they did not want her there, and that she had little reason to push the issue as it would have only hurt her standing within the administration.\n\nWhen a small group of senior senators responsible for direct oversight of the agency and its funding asker her to brief them, Haspel had no choice but to oblige. Her appearance drew sharp statements from lawmakers who compared her briefing favorably to what they'd gotten from Pompeo and Mattis. Corker told CNN Haspel delivered the \"Most precise presentation I've ever heard in 12 years.\"\n\nDistance from MBS\n\nIn the leadup to this week's brief, the President and his aides watched angrily as leaks continued to emerge showing the CIA has evidence that MBS and a top aide involved in Khashoggi's murder exchanged multiple messages around the time of the killing. The details of those messages however have not been revealed.\n\nAt the G20 summit in Argentina over the weekend, images of Russian President Vladimir Putin backslapping the young Saudi prince were met with a certain degree of satisfaction among Trump's aides -- the best illustration, in their minds, of what it might look like should Riyadh turn away from the United States and toward other, more repressive, regimes.\n\nTrump's encounters with MBS at the G20 were purposely kept at a minimum. Advisers stacked the President's agenda with meetings, making little time for extended discussions with the crown prince. When the two did run across each other on the margins of a group meeting, there was little time for detailed talks. The discussion was cordial, one person familiar with it said, and not the type of direct confrontation that French President Emmanuel Macron employed when he ran across MBS at the summit.\n\nCongress ignored\n\nAnimating much of the anger among lawmakers over the Khashoggi affair is the sense that they have been ignored throughout the process. According to interviews with more than a dozen senators and aides, at the heart of the split was the administration's refusal to budge when concerns were raised about the murder, as well as the growing crisis in Yemen. As many as 14 million Yemenis are suffering severe food shortages, aid agencies say, while an estimated 85,000 children under the age of 5 may have already died of starvation or disease, according to Save the Children.\n\nCorker made clear he had no desire to support the resolution cutting off US military aid for Saudi operations in Yemen. For days he pleaded with the administration, privately and publicly, to change course. A statement. A more active policy response. Something to send a message to the young Saudi crown prince. But nothing came., so he voted to support the resolution even though he opposed its intent.\n\nWhile Corker has frequently clashed with Trump, the administration's accommodating posture toward Saudi has turned even some of its strongest allies into critics. Sen. Todd Young is a prime example. An Indiana Republican and Naval Academy graduate, Young is known to be a staunch national security hawk -- and he said recently he \"will take a backseat to no one as an Iran hawk\" -- but for nearly two years he has made a primary focus the expanding humanitarian crisis in Yemen and pressuring the administration to change the conflict's trajectory.\n\nHe is also known to be press shy, avoiding hallway interviews with reporters and rarely weighing in on issues unless he has a specific point to make.\n\nThat changed shortly before Pompeo's briefing, when Young and an aide walked up to a group of reporters standing near a bank of cameras and said he wanted to make an on-camera statement. He ended up taking to the Senate floor instead, where he unleashed a blistering speech.\n\nYoung noted the administration, for months, had not taken seriously a statutory requirement to certify that the government of Saudi Arabia was taking steps to end the civil war in Yemen and the resulting humanitarian crisis. The certification the administration had sent \u2014 which was required by a measure Young had helped craft and push into law \u2014 \"was not credible,\" he said on the floor. \"Despite repeated requests for answers to our questions regarding Saudi Arabia and Yemen, we couldn't get responsive or timely answers from the administration.\"\n\nYoung then detailed a bipartisan follow-up letter, which asked the administration for clarifications about clear inconsistencies in its certification. It had been ignored until the day before Pompeo's briefing, when the administration, belatedly recognizing the trouble it was in on the Yemen resolution vote, finally replied. As to how it was received: \"It was late, and it was unresponsive,\" Young said. He too would join Corker in supporting the Yemen measure he had previously opposed, he said.\n\nWhat can Congress do?\n\nWhile most of the roughly dozen senators who were briefed by Haspel said the US should issue a response punishing those involved in Khashoggi's murder, there is not yet consensus on what to do, or even if Congress has the bandwidth to pass anything with teeth. The Republican-led House has made clear it won't take up anything the Senate sends its way. There's less than a month to go on the current session of Congress, and of course, the President could veto any bill sent his way.\n\nWednesday night, Graham -- along with Sens. Marco Rubio, Dianne Feinstein, Ed Markey, Todd Young and Chris Coons -- introduced a strongly worded though non-binding resolution condemning the crown prince for a range of actions, including the crisis in Yemen, the blockade in Qatar, the jailing of dissidents and the killing of Khashoggi. The measure is a symbolic rebuke -- and could be added to a broader package targeting Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Those who suggest we must sacrifice our principles for security will have neither,\" said Young, a Republican from Indiana.\n\nGraham and Young, along with Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, are pushing a separate bill to require mandatory sanctions on any individual responsible for the death of Khashoggi, which could include MBS. It also, among other provisions, would call for a total prohibition on sales of arms to Saudi Arabia that could be used for offensive purposes -- a potential flashpoint for a President who has repeatedly touted arm sales to the kingdom as he describes the US-Saudi relationship.\n\nDiscussions are ongoing about whether to go for an up or down vote on the Senate floor for the resolution curtailing US support for the war in Yemen, or whether to open the floor up to a potentially unruly amendment process. Corker is crafting an amendment that would directly address the Khashogi issue, and potentially separate it from Yemen. Senate aides say the process remains fluid, as meetings across Capitol Hill continue behind closed doors.\n\nThe real importance of congressional action, senators and aides involved in the efforts say, is the message it sends to the world, particularly as the parties negotiate in Sweden over a ceasefire. Pompeo has emphasized the importance of giving the warring parties in Yemen the space to reach a deal rather than piling on pressure from Congress. \"The more support from you we get the better chance we have of ending the conflict and stopping the suffering that none of us are happy about.\"\n\nThe administration's efforts on that front haven't just been confined to Congress. CNN reported last month that the US had \"slammed the brakes on\" a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a limited ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in Yemen, over concerns about angering Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe White House's defense of Saudi -- and its explicit support for MBS -- shows no signs of abating, a calculation defined by the long-standing relationship and its value to countering foes like Iran. Recent weeks have shown that it is a stance, however firm, that could come at a cost. Already some of Capitol Hill's stalwart Trump supporters have broken with the President and his Cabinet on this issue. Graham, a Trump golfing partner and vocal supporter of the President and his top lieutenants, went so far as to accuse Pompeo and Mattis of willful ignorance. \"I think the reason they don't draw the conclusion that (MBS) is complicit is because the administration doesn't want to go down that road.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: America is paying an awful price for Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ew6K-BCM0xE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN and The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) After a \" wonderful and very warm dinner \" with China's President Xi Jinping, last weekend, President Donald Trump launched a barrage of tweets extolling his great accomplishments. The Chinese, he said, had agreed to remove a 40% tariff on American car imports; they would soon start buying US agricultural products ; they had apparently made major concessions as part of a 90-day pause in raising tariffs. The stock markets revved up for a big jump, believing Trump's damaging trade war was coming to an end.\n\nBut a serious problem became apparent before long: China was not confirming the details that made Trump's claims so encouraging. Reluctantly optimistic investors drove the market higher on Monday. But by Tuesday, as China's state-controlled media specifically noted that there was \" no confirmation from Beijing \" about parts of Trump's claims, stock markets fell into a vertiginous downward spiral . The Dow dropped a whopping 799 points.\n\nThe next day, China finally expressed optimism about trade talks (without confirming any of Trump's specific claims) but by then the market had sent two clear messages.\n\nFirst, Trump's lies, exaggerations and self-serving boasts may not bother his most loyal followers, but the rest of the world is not a Trump MAGA rally. Everyone else notices that much of the time the President of the United States cannot be believed.\n\nSecond, this loss of credibility comes at a steep price. It doesn't only affect Donald Trump and his closest aides , who faithfully bolster his falsehoods, damaging their own reputation. It ultimately exacts a price from the entire nation.\n\nThe President's chronic practice of saying and doing what he thinks is good for him is making the country itself less trusted by its allies , less fiscally sound and less respected around the world. America and its people are already paying, and the costs will continue to mount.\n\nIt may be comforting to believe that once the Trump era ends -- however that happens -- the United States will return to some sort of pre-Trump normalcy; that America's allies will trust Washington again and the friendships will continue as if the Trump turmoil had not happened; that the markets will have faith in America as the relatively trusted global epicenter of financial activity; that the world will once again believe what some once did, as former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in his eulogy to George H.W. Bush, that the United States is \"the greatest democratic republic that God has ever placed on the face of this Earth;\" that they will again look up to the United States for inspiration on human rights, a free press, diversity and equality. But we should expect no automatic return to the status quo ante Trump on many fronts.\n\nFor one, Trump will leave America's fiscal house on a creaking foundation. After last year's tax cut, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the annual budget deficit will reach a staggering $1 trillion in 2020, with the national debt exploding.\n\nTrump may have pretended to care about this issue before he was president, but the Daily Beast recently reported that when aides tried to show Trump the spike in debt -- a hockey stick shape, gently rising and then shooting up, vertically -- he noted that the worst part will come after his presidency. \"Yeah,\" he said, according to a source cited by the Daily Beast, \"but I won't be here.\"\n\nIt may be terrible for the country, but not necessarily for Trump.\n\nThe country will have to deal with the consequences of irresponsible fiscal management after Trump and his enablers are gone, just as it will have to deal with the lacerations he is inflicting on America's diplomatic alliances.\n\nTrump has an unseemly habit of taking pleasure in the troubles of US democratic allies. You can be sure they are taking notice. With French President Emmanuel Macron under pressure from massive street protests and the French people enduring tense times, Trump took the opportunity to boast, gleefully claiming somehow that the protests prove him right in opposing efforts to slow climate change. He also reposted a tweet that falsely claimed French protesters were chanting \"We want Trump.\" French media rushed to make the point that no such chant was heard in France.\n\nTrump has not only rejoiced in the troubles of allies' leaders , he also disparaged them during their difficult times . That's the opposite of what a loyal friend would do.\n\nAfter Trump leaves the White House it will not be easy to convince America's closest allies -- once bitten -- that they can place their confidence in the United States, as if nothing had happened. They are already talking about learning to live without America's security protection . That may sound like a relief to some in the United States, but it, in fact, weakens the country. America will not be as strong if it is no longer the trusted leader of a mighty democratic bloc.\n\nWhen Trump seemed committed to protecting a friend, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, after Saudi agents assassinated journalist Jamal Khashoggi, he did it in a characteristically misleading, nonsensical manner, arguably making matters worse for the embattled crown prince. By so transparently equivocating about the case, claiming outlandish job benefits from an arms deal, and casting doubt on US intelligence findings, he drew even more attention to the case and managed to discredit both the Saudi leader and the United States.\n\nFor more opinion...

Chris Logan told CNN.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment, saying it doesn't discuss intelligence matters.\n\nSouth Korea's Defense Ministry, citing the country's Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged Yeongjeo-ri is a missile base and is \"one of the important North Korean sites that is being tracked and surveilled in cooperation with the United States.\"\n\nA spokesman for the ministry refused to comment further, saying \"it is not appropriate for our military to officially acknowledge the content of a foreign media report.\"\n\nWhile Kim is not violating any agreement with the US or South Korea by continuing to produce and deploy existing types of missiles, the identification of yet another active North Korean missile base comes at a time when some members of the Trump administration are declaring that Pyongyang has failed to uphold its end of the bargain thus far.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton said Tuesday that Trump believes he should hold a second summit with Kim because the North Korean leader hasn't lived up to commitments he made during their first meeting.\n\n\"They have not lived up to the commitments so far,\" Bolton said at The Wall Street Journal's annual CEO Council conference in Washington. \"That's why I think the President thinks that another summit is likely to be productive.\"\n\nBolton said the US would press ahead with a second meeting shortly after the start of the new year -- saying, \"January, February\" -- in the hope of making further progress. He said the Trump administration would not lift hefty economic sanctions against the regime until then.\n\nTrump has often touted North Korea's lack of ballistic missile tests in recent months as a sign of diplomatic progress and said Kim's offer to dismantle some testing facilities signals the North Korean leader is serious about denuclearizing.\n\nBut while Trump maintains that Kim committed to fully denuclearize during their summit in Singapore this summer, the truth is that the meeting only yielded a vaguely worded agreement, in which the two leaders pledged to build a \"lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\" and to \"work toward complete denuclearization\" of the peninsula.\n\nThe Trump administration has also continued to insist on the elimination of North Korea's ballistic missile programs upfront -- a nonstarter for a nation that remains deeply suspicious of the outside world and would never leave itself strategically vulnerable simply for the promise of economic gain.\n\nWhile closing test facilities would make it harder for North Korea to develop new types of warheads, that step would do little to prevent Kim from continuing to mass produce and deploy existing types of nuclear-armed missiles, as he publicly said in January he would continue to do.\n\n\"Those missiles are being deployed at bases throughout North Korea, many of which have long been known to outside analysts. Any denuclearization agreement would require North Korea to allow international inspectors to determine that these units are no longer armed with nuclear weapons,\" according to the report from Lewis and Schmerler.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has publicly promised to secure access to North Korea military facilities as part of any agreement,\" the report states.\n\nBolton's comments Tuesday underscored the lack of progress the US has made in moving North Korea closer to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization Washington is seeking, and the concessions it has been making to Pyongyang, even as Trump has stressed the warmth of his relationship with Kim.\n\nLast month, Vice President Mike Pence told NBC News that the US will not require North Korea to provide a full list of its nuclear and missile sites before Trump meets again with Kim.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang had been locked in a diplomatic standoff for weeks over which side would make concessions first. Analysts said that by relaxing its demands ahead of a second summit, the US may have blinked first.\n\nPence spoke days after the release of additional new commercial satellite images identifying more than a dozen undeclared North Korean missile operating bases, another sign that Pyongyang is continuing to move forward with its ballistic missile program.\n\nOne such facility is the missile base near Yeongjeo-dong, a site that has long concerned US and South Korean officials and the subject of the analysis of the new images released Wednesday.\n\nIn 2000, the United States sought access to this and other missile bases as part of an agreement to end North Korea's missile program -- and was rebuffed by Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nThe base itself is strung along a narrow valley. A headquarters area is positioned at the mouth of the valley, the images show.\n\n\"Up through the valley there are a pair of hardened \"drive-through\" shelters that were covered with soil and had trees planted on them to disguise them. In front of the pair of drive throughs, there is a concrete pad that was also covered in dirt,\" according to the analysis by Lewis and Schmerler.\n\n\"There are five entrances to underground tunnels that may be used to store missiles,\" the report states. \"Around 2010, North Korea constructed a pair of large drive-through suitable for large ballistic missiles. These shelters are similar to the ones seen at the older portion of the Yeongjeo-dong base.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "US prepares to sail warship into Black Sea after Russia seizes Ukraine ships", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/AyJSGCkDflE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The US has begun making the necessary preparations to sail a warship into the Black Sea, a move that comes amid heightened tensions in the region following Russia's seizure of Ukrainian ships and detention of Ukrainian sailors.\n\nThe US military has requested that the State Department notify Turkey of its possible plans to sail a warship into the Black Sea, three US officials tell CNN, a move they said is a response to Russia's actions against Ukraine in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.\n\nFor its part, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced Wednesday that its troops in eastern Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014, conducted a military drill with its Pantsir anti-aircraft missile systems.\n\nActive preparations\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also claimed Wednesday that the Ukrainian government had undertaken \"active preparations\" for a military offensive in eastern Ukraine, using the recent declaration of martial law in select regions as a cover.\n\n\"Substantial offensive components are being transferred to the region, which are being dispersed along the entire contact line,\" spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Wednesday at a press briefing.\n\nThe US is required to notify Turkey about the passage through the straits under the Montreux Convention, a 1936 treaty that governs the passage of military vessels through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, which connect the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.\n\nUnder the rules of the treaty, countries that do not have a coastline on the Black Sea are required to provide Turkey with at least 15 days' notice prior to transiting the straits.\n\n'Prepared to respond'\n\nA State Department spokesman said, \"the United States carries out its activities consistent with the terms of the Montreux Convention.

Her monument will be built in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.\n\nIlluminating hidden histories\n\nDeputy Mayor Glen, a huge advocate for the project, says historical monuments and statues are a critical way for people to understand the values and history of a city, and indeed, the country.\n\n\"The ability to connect to our history happens in a very visual way,\" she told CNN. \"If you don't see it, you may not believe it. And when you walk around the city and only see men, you may start to think that women didn't matter, or perhaps that they didn't do anything.\"\n\nIt's hard to get an accurate tally of how many statues, monuments and plaques around the city are dedicated to men versus women, and Glen says it can be like comparing apples to oranges. Does a plaque count? A relief? What about fictional depictions or anonymous symbolic figures?\n\nGlen offered up a case study: \"Central Park is the most visited urban park in the US,\" she said. \"There are 132 statues in Central Park, and only one of them depicts a woman.\"\n\nA 76-foot statue of explorer Christopher Columbus stands in Columbus Circle in New York City.\n\nThat \"woman\" is Alice from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" who is neither real nor American (author Lewis Carroll was British).\n\n\"Let's just put it this way,\" Glen said, \"The overwhelming majority of these monuments, statues and plaques depict men.\"\n\nThe few depictions of women around the city include the Gertrude Stein Monument in Bryant Park, the Harriet Tubman Monument on Malcolm X Blvd and the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument and Joan of Arc Memorial -- both in Riverside Park. A fifth statue, honoring former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, stands in a privately owned plaza.\n\nMeyer says the new push to add more statues of women around the city was in part inspired by the ongoing conversations about American monuments and their relevancy and value to the modern public (for instance, the recent controversies over Confederate monuments and what to do with them).\n\n\"Across the country, people were looking at controversial monuments and realizing that something should be done, that some monuments should be taken down, and new monuments should be introduced,\" she said. So the mayor's office put together a commission last year to review the monuments around the city.\n\n\"The commission took a look at some of the more controversial monuments and put together a report, and it was clear after that initial review was done (that) there's not enough statues of women,\" she said.\n\nAdding to the story -- not taking away\n\nThe mission of She Built NYC isn't one of removing and replacing history -- as some supporters of Confederate monuments may argue.\n\n\"This is not about deleting history,\" Deputy Mayor Glen said. \"This is about filling out the American story. These women have always been part of it, we just want to exhume their achievements from the coffin of history.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the city's department of cultural affairs set aside $10 million for new monuments. Meyer says the hope is that individual donors will also contribute to the project.\n\nIt's not a monument, but the \"Fearless Girl\" sculpture was a sensation when it debuted near New York's Wall Street in 2017.\n\n\"I think people are excited to be a part of this process,\" she said. \"There's nothing like this in New York City, and now people can have their voice heard and feel really involved in shaping the city.\"\n\nMeyer said She Built NYC is already considering their next monument, and another working group is talking about ways to better honor Native Americans within the city.\n\n\"I think it's undeniable that this concept of if you can see it, you can be it,\" Meyer said. \"Think about little girls who just walk around the city, and all they see is white men on top of horses. That's not what New York City is all about, and it's a false representation of history. We need to make sure that our public realm reflects who we have been and who we're going to be.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "USA Gymnastics files for bankruptcy after hefty lawsuits over Larry Nassar", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/prFTv8-LhZM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) USA Gymnastics has filed for bankruptcy as the 200,000-member organization struggles to recover from the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal.\n\nThe filing Wednesday will help \"expedite an equitable resolution of the claims made by the survivors of sexual abuse perpetrated by Larry Nassar,\" USAG said. \"We owe it to these brave women who have come forward.\"\n\nThe organization said the filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't change its day-to-day operations.\n\nAttorney John Manly said that USAG's leadership \"has proven itself to be both morally and financially bankrupt.\"\n\n\"This bankruptcy filing will suspend all lawsuits by Nassar survivors and their ongoing efforts to discover the truth about who at USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee knew about Nassar's criminal conduct and failed to stop it,\" Manly said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Internal Facebook emails show Zuckerberg targeted a competitor", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/ql-JeqMfQkc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "New York and London (CNN Business) Mark Zuckerberg and his colleagues were apparently concerned enough about Vine, a video app from Twitter, that on the day it launched in January 2013, they moved to restrict its access to Facebook user data, a trove of internal Facebook emails released by the U.K. Parliament on Wednesday shows.\n\nThe decision to restrict Vine's access to data, which would have allowed its users to invite their Facebook friends to join the app, was in line with a company policy at the time, Facebook told CNN on Wednesday. That policy restricted apps' access to Facebook data when the company deemed that the apps \"replicated\" Facebook's \"core functionality.\" In other word, apps that Facebook thought might compete with them.\n\n\"Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video,\" Facebook vice-president Justin Osofsky wrote to Zuckerberg and others the day Vine launched, according to the emails released by the UK Parliament.\n\n\"Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. We've prepared reactive PR,\" Osofsky added.\n\n\"Yup, go for it,\" Zuckerberg responded.\n\nFacebook said Wednesday that Zuckerberg and his colleagues were only following Facebook's policy protecting against competitors. But the company changed the policy on Tuesday, one day before the emails were released.\n\n\"As part of our ongoing review we have decided that we will remove this out of date policy so that our platform remains as open as possible. We think this is the right thing to do as platforms and technology develop and grow,\" a Facebook spokesperson said Wednesday.\n\n\"We built our developer platform years ago to pave the way for innovation in social apps and services. At that time we made the decision to restrict apps built on top of our platform that replicated our core functionality,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"These kind of restrictions are common across the tech industry with different platforms having their own variant including YouTube, Twitter, Snap and Apple.\"\n\nVine, which allowed users to shoot and posts six second looped videos, shut down in 2017. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApparently responding to Wednesday's revelations, Vine co-founder Rus Yusupov tweeted , \"Competition sucks, right? No. It allows for products to improve, become available to more people, at lower costs. Strive to build new things that people want and influence other creators for the cycle to continue.\"\n\nZuckerberg talks\n\nThe email discussion about Vine is part of a trove of internal Facebook documents the company fought to keep secret.\n\nThe documents include conversations among senior Facebook executives.\n\nThe cache stems from a lawsuit brought against Facebook by a small app company called Six4Three. In a blog post Wednesday, Facebook said \"The documents were selectively leaked to publish some, but not all, of the internal discussions at Facebook.\"\n\nZuckerberg himself posted on Facebook as well, writing , \"I understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems. That's healthy given the vast number of people who use our services around the world, and it is right that we are constantly asked to explain what we do. But it's also important that the coverage of what we do -- including the explanation of these internal documents -- doesn't misrepresent our actions or motives. This was an important change to protect our community, and it achieved its goal.\"\n\nThe documents\n\nA California judge had placed the documents under seal. But when Six4Three's CEO, Ted Kramer, was in London last month, he was escorted to Parliament and told to produce the documents or be held in contempt.\n\nSix4Three \u2014 which had an app that allowed users to search for pictures of their friends in swimsuits \u2014 has accused the social media giant of having little regard for user privacy and claimed that Zuckerberg devised a plan that forced some of Facebook's rivals, or potential rivals, out of business. Facebook says the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nThe UK parliamentary committee, led by Damian Collins, asked for the documents as part of a larger investigation into Facebook, fake news, disinformation and data privacy that has been going on for more than a year. The committee has repeatedly asked Zuckerberg to give evidence, but thus far he's avoided the committee, even when it brought together lawmakers from nine different countries for an unprecedented \"International Grand Committee on Disinformation.\"\n\n\"I believe there is considerable public interest in releasing these documents. They raise important questions about how Facebook treats users data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market,\" Collins said on Twitter. \"We don't feel we have had straight answers from Facebook on these important issues, which is why we are releasing the documents.\"\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said in a statement after the release of the documents, \"As we've said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context. We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends' data with developers. Like any business, we had many of internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform.

Bush as a modest but mighty president, a man whose characteristic humility was belied one final time with all the pageantry of a state funeral.\n\n\"He valued character over pedigree and he was not a cynic. He looked for the good in everybody, and usually he found it,\" President George W. Bush told 3,000 political leaders and family members who congregated at the National Cathedral to say goodbye.\n\n\"To us,\" the younger Bush said, \"he was close to perfect.\"\n\nAs Christian hymns echoed through the cathedral's limestone arches, sung and played by military orchestras and choirs, there seemed to be more laughter than tears in the pews -- a reflection of a long life lived in the company of good friends and family.\n\nHis eulogists each captured the successive roles Bush played in his lifetime: World War II flyboy, statesman, friend and father.\n\n\"He showed me what it means to be a president who serves with integrity, leads with courage and acts in love with his heart for the citizens of our country,\" George W. Bush said, describing his father as a man who preferred steaks and vodka martinis over broccoli, speed-boated and skydived as an octogenarian, and who lived life at two settings: \"full throttle and sleep.\"\n\nWhen the tears did come , it was when Bush was remembered as a family man who doted on the large brood who filled the first several rows of the sanctuary. George W. Bush, who as president was sometimes prone to an occasional cry, appeared to steel himself with deep breaths throughout the service before letting out a sob.\n\n\"He was the best father a son or daughter could have,\" he said, his eyes welling up and his body quaking. When he concluded, the congregation burst into sustained applause.\n\nHe was one of the five living US commanders in chief at the event; Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama all attended along with President Donald Trump. It's the first time all five men have convened face-to-face since Trump took office.\n\nBitter disputes between Trump and his predecessors have fractured the traditional presidents' club. There was little warmth when Trump greeted only his direct predecessor Obama before taking his seat and looking directly ahead.\n\nThe younger Bush, seated with his family instead of with his fellow presidents, seemed to break the unease when he handed Michelle Obama a candy -- the same gesture she extended to him in September at the funeral of Sen. John McCain.\n\nThough the tributes delivered Wednesday focused squarely on the late president, the traits of the current one -- sitting mostly stone-faced in the front row -- made for a stark comparison.\n\n\"Those that travel the high road of humility in Washington are not bothered by heavy traffic,\" said former Sen. Alan Simpson.\n\n\"To us, his was the brightest of 1,000 points of light,\" George W. Bush said, using the same campaign motto Trump ridiculed several months ago during a speech.\n\nFor the last two days, Americans both powerful and ordinary have filed past Bush's flag-draped casket in the Capitol Rotunda, paying their respects to a man who oversaw the end of the Cold War but who suffered defeat after one term.\n\nTo the strains of \"Hail to the Chief,\" the late president was carried from the Capitol and transported by hearse along streets lined with spectators braving bitter cold. He passed through a mostly shut-down city where he arrived first as a congressman and later served as a UN ambassador, CIA director, vice president and, finally, as commander in chief.\n\n\"He was our shield in danger's hour,\" Jon Meacham, the presidential historian, said in his eulogy. \"An imperfect man, he left us a more perfect union.\"\n\nLike all presidents, Bush oversaw plans for his own funeral starting years ago, updating the details as time went on so the ceremony would reflect his druthers. The readings came from three granddaughters.\n\nUnlike some of his predecessors, Bush told advisers he did not want his ceremony to drag on endlessly, mindful of attendees' time. Ninety minutes were blocked off, though these events typically extend past the allotted span.\n\n\"He told me I only had 10 minutes. He was direct about it. It wasn't even funny,\" said Simpson, whose eulogy provided a healthy dose of comic relief.\n\nIn the crowd sat Jordan's King, Britain's Prince of Wales, Germany's Chancellor and Poland's President, a reflection of a foreign policy hailed as measured and based in core American values.\n\n\"Let me tell you -- when George Herbert Walker Bush was President of the United States, every single head of government in the world knew that they were dealing with a gentleman -- a genuine leader -- one who was distinguished, resolute and brave,\" said former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.\n\nAfter Irish tenor Ronan Tynan sang the final hymn, \"Last full measure of devotion,\" Bush's casket departed back down the marble aisle, returning eventually to his adopted hometown of Houston on the military aircraft known as Air Force One when a sitting president is aboard.\n\nHe'll be buried in his family plot at Texas A&M University in College Station on Thursday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The nation honors President George H.W.

Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.\n\nGlobal leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that \"we are in deep trouble with climate change.\"\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThe new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades.\n\n\"The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,\" according to the report.\n\nThe report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nThose recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation.\n\nThe report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies.\n\nGeneral climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.\n\nOnly about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.\n\n'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'\n\nThe new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication . She was not involved in the report.\n\nJUST WATCHED New climate change report issues stark warning Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New climate change report issues stark warning 02:13\n\nIn October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nThen, in November, a separate report called The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change showed how extreme heat from climate change already has been affecting productivity, food supply and disease transmission worldwide.\n\nAlso last month, the US government's National Climate Assessment warned that the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century due to climate change-related impacts.\n\nThe new WHO report comes with a message that \"addressing climate change is an area of opportunity. It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently.

Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date. Bush also publicly called for the use of alternatives . In 2009, President Barack Obama revoked these orders and allowed the National Institutes of Health to issue new criteria for stem cell research.\n\nThe hope for alternatives has been revived by the current administration. In its September statement, HHS concluded that it is continuing to review \"whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue\" and \"will ensure that efforts to develop such alternatives are funded and accelerated.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "10-minute cancer test could detect cancer anywhere in the body, new study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/_i_KIM0pCRk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Researchers in Australia have developed a 10-minute test that can detect the presence of cancer cells anywhere in the human body, according to a newly published study .\n\nThe test was developed after researchers from the University of Queensland found that cancer forms a unique DNA structure when placed in water.\n\nThe test works by identifying the presence of that structure, a discovery which could help detect cancer in humans far earlier than current methods, according to the paper published in journal Nature Communications\n\n\"Discovering that cancerous DNA molecules formed entirely different 3D nanostructures from normal circulating DNA was a breakthrough that has enabled an entirely new approach to detect cancer non-invasively in any tissue type including blood,\" said Professor Matt Trau in a statement.\n\n\"This led to the creation of inexpensive and portable detection devices that could eventually be used as a diagnostic tool, possibly with a mobile phone,\" he added.\n\nJUST WATCHED Experimental treatment uses modified stem cells to fight cancer Replay More Videos ...

She squinted, homed in on his hands and then shifted her shoulders back with satisfaction.\n\n\"He looks good,\" she said.\n\nOak and the other monkeys arrived in mid-November at Jungle Friends, this primate sanctuary in Gainesville where Bagnall serves as founder and director\n\nThe monkeys were once involved in a US Food and Drug Administration study intended to investigate the role of various levels of nicotine in the onset of addiction in teens and young adults.\n\nIn January, after the deaths of four monkeys involved in the research drew criticism from some animal rights activists, the agency ended the study. The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an Animal Welfare Council to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview.\n\nThe squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.\n\nThe common squirrel monkey , or Saimiri sciureus , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds.\n\nWhen the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked \"gorgeous\" and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment.\n\nBagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.\n\n\"The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"All of these monkeys were born inside,\" she said. \"They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.\"\n\nFor now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.\n\nA 'scientific, ethical and economic' debate\n\nThe monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.\n\nIn the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the US Department of Agriculture\n\nAs for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida.\n\nSome scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.\n\nMatthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in January that \"undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.\n\n\"Animals played a role in the development of each of the top 25 most prescribed drugs in America,\" he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.\n\n\"Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research,\" he said. \"If you love animals, you really should support animal research.\"\n\nWhile visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.\n\n\"The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur,\" he said. \"Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.\"\n\nAdjusting to the outside world\n\nWhen lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.\n\nThat's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.\n\n\"You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside,\" Bagnall said.\n\nFor the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.\n\n\"So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months,\" she said. \"Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.\"\n\nAnother reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.\n\nMeanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.\n\nOak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends.\n\n\"This is unusual,\" said Collins, who has been treating Oak. \"Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is rheumatoid arthritis? Replay More Videos ...

It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals,\" Collins said.\n\n\"That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species,\" he said. \"So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a \"music hour\" and listened to the soundtrack of \"Forrest Gump\" while playing in their cages.\n\nOak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: \"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.\"\n\nIn that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.\n\nThe road to retirement\n\nThe saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.\n\nThat year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.\n\nAfter learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, it sued the FDA\n\nAbout a month later, world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall penned a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was \"disturbed\" and shocked\" to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb responded directly to Goodall , writing, \"After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.\"\n\nBecause the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday.\n\nIf the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. \"In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.\"\n\nAccording to the FDA's website , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products.\n\nIn January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but \"the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.\"\n\n\"This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research,\" FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.\n\nThe FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming a working group to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools.\n\n\"These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food,\" she wrote.\n\nSome politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.\n\n\"I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home,\" Florida Rep.

While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California, she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.\n\nBut that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM.\n\nEven on Facebook, his mother couldn't find kindred souls.\n\nThen, one day, a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.\n\nOlivera was in her last semester of nursing school, and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors, since her son's disease and polio are similar.\n\nThe members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.\n\nAFM and polio: eerie similarities\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio crippled more than 35,000 people a year on average, making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPolio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients, mainly children, start out with what looks like a cold or the flu, and then paralysis strikes.\n\nSince 2014, there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states, according to the CDC . The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.\n\nThanks to the polio vaccine, the US has been polio free since 1979 , according to the CDC.\n\nBut there is no cure or vaccine for AFM, and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.\n\nSome have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.\n\n\"I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory,\" Murray said. \"I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.\"\n\nBailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.\"Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again,\" Mikell Sheehan said.\n\n\n\nBailey Sheehan's physical therapist, Melissa Murray, researched care for children with polio to help Bailey recover from AFM.\n\nLooking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is \"extraordinary,\" according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of \"Polio: An American Story,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.\n\n\"To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that,\" he said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?\n\nThen she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.\n\nIt was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.\n\nShe knew she was in the right place.\n\nSo did the polio survivors.\n\n\"Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.\n\nThe survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.\n\n\"They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'\" Olivera remembers. \"So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!\"\n\nAs Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.\n\nSeeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.\n\n\"Hey, cover that thing up,\" a passerby yelled.\n\nHe was referring to her leg brace.\n\n\"I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!\" remembers Puch, who's now 65. \"I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?\"\n\nShe told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.\n\n\"When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children,\" Puch said.\n\nThat advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.\n\n\"Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all,\" she remembers. \"After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.\"\n\n\"We were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability,\" Erin Olivera said.\n\nToday, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.\n\nNot wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, \" Too Early for Flowers ,\" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM.

with a Gambling Commission report suggesting 430,000 Britons can be described as such - and helps fuel under-age gambling.\n\nThe deal follows extensive talks between firms - also including SkyBet, Betfred, Betfair, Stan James, Gala Coral and William Hill - to ensure no adverts will be broadcast for a defined period before and after a game is broadcast.\n\nThe proposal is similar to those made by the Labour party and, importantly, will include any game that starts prior to the 9pm watershed but ends after that time.\n\nThe RGA has previously said it was \"very mindful of public concerns\".\n\nHorse racing will be exempt from the restrictions - given the commercial importance of gambling on its viability - but all other sports will be included.\n\nHowever, it is the impact on football where the ban will be felt the most, especially given the financial value of the sport to both the gambling companies and broadcasters.\n\nNearly 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have gambling companies as shirt sponsors.\n\nFinal ratification is needed from the Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) before the ban comes into force.\n\nThat should be a formality, according to industry insiders, and could come as early as this month or in early 2019.\n\nTom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said he was \"delighted\" by the move as the number of adverts during live sports had \"clearly reached crisis levels\".\n\nHe added: \"There was clear public support for these restrictions and I'm glad that the Remote Gambling Association has taken its responsibilities seriously and listened.\"\n\nCould shirt sponsorship be next?\n\nMatt Zarb-Cousin is a spokesperson for Fairer Gambling, a not-for-profit entity campaigning to reduce gambling-related harm and crime.\n\nIt is long overdue, there has been a huge amount of pressure on the sector over the volume of advertising which has increased exponentially year on year.\n\nBut for it to be truly effective, it should also include shirt and league sponsorship and digital advertising around a pitch.\n\nIt is better that there are going to be no ads during live sporting events but that falls some way short of being effective. If the whistle-to-whistle TV advertising ban is justified then the other things are as well.\n\nI think it is worth bearing in mind that it is the broadcasters that have been most resistant to the clampdown on advertising.\n\nI think the writing is on the wall. If they hadn't done this, the government would have acted anyway, perhaps next year.\n\nThere is no legislation in the pipeline but the strength of feeling cross-party and in both houses suggests that it is unsustainable."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Mental health: The NHS patients who are 'abused and ignored'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46459434", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nNew rights should be given to severely ill mental health patients detained in hospital to stop abuse and neglect of this vulnerable group, a review says.\n\nThe 1983 Mental Health Act is outdated and needs an overhaul, sectioning is being misused and does not properly protect patients' rights, it says.\n\nThe independent review - ordered by the government - heard from patients who had suffered during their detentions.\n\nThe prime minister said the injustices were unacceptable and promised action.\n\n'Anxious and suicidal'\n\nKate King, 56, spent seven years in and out of hospitals in East Anglia after being admitted in 2004 following a period of post-natal depression.\n\nShe said her detention probably saved her life as she had been really struggling following the birth of her two children but her experience, in a variety of units, had been \"awful\" at times.\n\n\"I was abused and ignored. I lost my voice,\" she said.\n\nShe said she had experienced other patients being aggressive and swearing at her, with one even stalking her.\n\nBut she also complained about her treatment at the hands of staff.\n\n\"I was restrained face down on a mattress. One nurse even told me I should kill myself,\" she said.\n\n\"When I tried to object or complain, I was not listened to. There was good care too - I remember once being taken go-karting. But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nMrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked.\n\nIt included mental health professionals, academics and patients.\n\nThe 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including:\n\nnew rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment\n\nmore frequent opportunities to challenge detention\n\nlegally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned\n\na requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests\n\nan end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients\n\nthe right to choose a \"nominated person\" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative\n\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date.\n\n\"It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nIt is unclear why this has happened as the rates of severe mental illness have remained stable.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment.

given to Prime Minister Theresa May by the Attorney General on the proposed backstop plan, which aims to avoid a hard border in Ireland under all circumstances.\n\nThe backstop, or guarantee, appears in a \"Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland\", which forms part of the UK's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.\n\nIt would only come into effect if a UK-EU trade agreement keeping the border open is not ready by the end of a post-Brexit transition period.\n\nMuch of the advice given by the Attorney General is not new, but it is set out in black and white for the first time.\n\nHere are some excerpts from the six-page document.\n\nThis is a reminder that Northern Ireland would be more deeply entwined in the EU's customs rules and procedures than the rest of the UK.\n\nNorthern Ireland would retain full membership of the EU customs union, while Great Britain would be in a separate customs union with the EU.\n\nThe outcome of this complex arrangement is that the whole of the United Kingdom would be in a single customs territory with the EU.\n\nThat means there would be no tariffs on goods passing between anywhere in the UK and the EU, but declarations would have to be made (not involving any kind of border checks) for goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is a carefully crafted fudge, in other words, with which no-one is entirely happy.\n\nThis section spells out clearly the implications of Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK does not.\n\nAgain, there are no surprises here, but the Attorney General emphasises that, for regulatory purposes, Great Britain would be treated as a third (or separate) country by Northern Ireland.\n\nThat means that for goods crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland (but not in the other direction) regulatory checks would have to take place.\n\nThe EU has conceded that many of them (on things like product standards) could take place online or away from ports or airports.\n\nBut that is not the case for checks on food and animal produce. There are already checks on live animals arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, but this would be a much broader system of controls.\n\nThis point is already clear in the text of the Withdrawal Agreement, but the Attorney General is giving a legal opinion about international law: everyone says the backstop is intended to be temporary, but it could - in theory - remain in place indefinitely \"unless or until\" another permanent agreement takes its place.\n\nThis is only one of several ways in which many supporters of Brexit fear a trap, although it is quite clear that the EU is equally uncomfortable with many aspects of the backstop.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe Attorney General sets out at some length why the EU does not like the backstop either.\n\nIt raises awkward legal questions about the UK (a country that will no longer be part of the EU) being responsible for protecting one of the borders of the EU single market.\n\nIt could also, he suggests, provoke complaints (legal or otherwise) from Irish companies, which might argue that the EU is giving rival companies in Northern Ireland the competitive advantage of full access to both the EU and UK markets.\n\nAnd it complicates the EU's ability to strike future trade deals around the world, because the EU would not be able to define the extent of its customs territory precisely.\n\nIt is likely to be important for the EU, the Attorney General says, that the backstop can be presented as \"a temporary arrangement with a clear and early end\".\n\nAs if there was not already enough concern being expressed about the backstop and the lack of a UK right to leave it unilaterally, this will add fuel to the fire.\n\nIt suggests that the language used in the protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement might allow the EU to suggest that the UK-wide part of the backstop should be abandoned, while keeping Northern Ireland closely tied to the EU.\n\nBut the lack of a unilateral exit clause cuts both ways. If the UK cannot bring the backstop to an end without the EU's approval, then similarly the UK would have to agree to the EU ending it.\n\nIt has been designed deliberately to concentrate minds on a permanent alternative solution.\n\nIn the end, as the Attorney General points out, this is a highly political construction.\n\nBut the prospect of the UK being unable to leave a temporary customs union without a subsequent agreement on the Irish border makes many people extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThis gets to the heart of the problem. The EU believes the only way for the Irish border to remain as open as it is now is for either Northern Ireland or the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union and the single market. And it says it is still waiting for the UK to come up with a credible alternative plan.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Gambling firms agree 'whistle-to-whistle' television sport advertising ban", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/46453954", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Britain's biggest gambling companies have voluntarily agreed to a \"whistle-to-whistle\" television advertising ban.\n\nThe Remote Gambling Association (RGA), which includes Bet365, Ladbrokes and Paddy Power, has struck a deal to stop adverts during live sports broadcasts.\n\nIt follows political pressure about the amount of betting advertising on TV.\n\nMore than 90 minutes of adverts were shown during the football World Cup and anti-gambling campaigners say sport's use of adverts \"normalises\" betting.\n\nThere are also fears it contributes to the rise in the amount of problem gamblers - with a Gambling Commission report suggesting 430,000 Britons can be described as such - and helps fuel under-age gambling.\n\nThe deal follows extensive talks between firms - also including SkyBet, Betfred, Betfair, Stan James, Gala Coral and William Hill - to ensure no adverts will be broadcast for a defined period before and after a game is broadcast.\n\nThe proposal is similar to those made by the Labour party and, importantly, will include any game that starts prior to the 9pm watershed but ends after that time.\n\nThe RGA has previously said it was \"very mindful of public concerns\".\n\nHorse racing will be exempt from the restrictions - given the commercial importance of gambling on its viability - but all other sports will be included.\n\nHowever, it is the impact on football where the ban will be felt the most, especially given the financial value of the sport to both the gambling companies and broadcasters.\n\nNearly 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have gambling companies as shirt sponsors.\n\nFinal ratification is needed from the Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) before the ban comes into force.\n\nThat should be a formality, according to industry insiders, and could come as early as this month or in early 2019.\n\nTom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said he was \"delighted\" by the move as the number of adverts during live sports had \"clearly reached crisis levels\".\n\nHe added: \"There was clear public support for these restrictions and I'm glad that the Remote Gambling Association has taken its responsibilities seriously and listened.\"\n\nCould shirt sponsorship be next?\n\nMatt Zarb-Cousin is a spokesperson for Fairer Gambling, a not-for-profit entity campaigning to reduce gambling-related harm and crime.\n\nIt is long overdue, there has been a huge amount of pressure on the sector over the volume of advertising which has increased exponentially year on year.\n\nBut for it to be truly effective, it should also include shirt and league sponsorship and digital advertising around a pitch.\n\nIt is better that there are going to be no ads during live sporting events but that falls some way short of being effective. If the whistle-to-whistle TV advertising ban is justified then the other things are as well.\n\nI think it is worth bearing in mind that it is the broadcasters that have been most resistant to the clampdown on advertising.\n\nI think the writing is on the wall. If they hadn't done this, the government would have acted anyway, perhaps next year.\n\nThere is no legislation in the pipeline but the strength of feeling cross-party and in both houses suggests that it is unsustainable."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "DUP will vote down deal but back Tories, says Nigel Dodds", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46461880", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA\n\nThe Democratic Unionists will back Theresa May's government in any vote of no confidence should her Brexit deal be rejected, its Westminster leader says.\n\nNigel Dodds told ITV his party would vote against the deal, but it would be \"illogical\" to vote out the government.\n\nLabour has said it will immediately press for a confidence vote if the deal is voted down next Tuesday.\n\nIf successful, the move could trigger a general election if no alternative government is formed in 14 days.\n\nAt a meeting of Tory backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith appealed for civility in internal party arguments over Brexit.\n\nGovernment sources said the whip's office was \"looking at all options\" to secure the support of the Commons.\n\nThe vote on the withdrawal deal and the declaration on future relations will take place on 11 December.\n\nMr Dodds told ITV's Robert Peston: \"Clearly if [the deal] is defeated, it would be somewhat illogical -

a measure designed to prevent the return of physical checks on the Irish border by the UK and EU sharing a single customs territory - she insisted neither the UK nor the EU wanted it to come into force in the first place.\n\nBut the Democratic Unionists said the advice was explicit that Northern Ireland would end up subject to different EU regulatory and customs rules from the rest of the UK and be treated as a \"third country\" in terms of trade with England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that, amid fears Mrs May was heading for a heavy defeat in next Tuesday's vote on the final deal, there was talk among MPs about a compromise amendment being tabled on the backstop, giving Parliament some kind of check on it coming into force.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @bbclaurak Some in govt v eager to find a way to avoid a mega defeat -

who say that it infringes the UK's sovereignty and will prevent the UK from being able to negotiate its own trade deals.\n\nMr Cox said that despite assurances that the arrangement was not intended to be permanent \"in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place\".\n\n\"In the absence of a right of termination, there is a legal risk that the UK might become subject to protracted and repeated rounds of negotiations,\" he said. \"The resolution of such a stalemate would have to be political.\"\n\nHowever, he also put forward the case that the \"risk\" of getting entangled in the backstop had to be weighed \"against the political and economic imperative of both sides to reach an agreement that constitutes a politically stable and permanent basis for their future relationship\".\n\nAnalysis: In black and white\n\nThe BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman\n\nWhen lawyers give legal advice they are expected to speak frankly.\n\nMany will conclude this advice is franker and starker than the way in which the government has presented the legal implications of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIn particular on the Northern Ireland backstop, it is there in black and white, that in the absence of an agreement replacing it, the backstop will continue indefinitely. The UK could not force the EU to conclude an agreement bringing it to an end.\n\nThat punctures the government's optimism on the issue. Whereas Article 50 allowed the UK to pull out of the EU, there is no provision for the UK to pull out of the withdrawal agreement. That will pour petrol on the flames of the political debate.\n\nMay defends advice at Prime Minister's Questions\n\nThe prime minister has insisted there can be no Brexit deal without a backstop of some kind to protect commitments made to Northern Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBut she came under fire at Prime Minister's Questions from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford.\n\n\"The legal advice is clear,\" he said. \"It states: despite statements in the protocol it is not permanent, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely. Since the prime minister returned from Brussels with her deal, the prime minister has been misleading the House inadvertently or otherwise.\n\n\"Is it time that the prime minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public?\n\nThe PM told MPs all the material published in the past few days was consistent.\n\nShe said she had made it clear that the UK could not unilaterally leave the backstop plan, so had not been at odds with the legal advice, which made it clear the UK had no sovereign right to withdraw.\n\nBut she insisted the arrangement would, if it came into force, give the UK a number of competitive advantages and therefore the EU would not want the UK \"to be in it any longer than necessary\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: EU makes 'predatory claim' on Northern Ireland\n\nBut the DUP's Sammy Wilson said other EU members would use the backstop as a \"cudgel\" to obtain concessions from the UK in future trade talks.\n\nAnd former foreign secretary Boris Johnson suggested the backstop could easily be dispensed with as it was \"not essential\" to the wider deal and everybody believed \"you can solve this without a hard border\".\n\n\"Let's just get rid of this nightmarish system that keeps us effectively clamped in the EU, and really stopping Brexit from taking place,\" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.\n\nLabour said the legal advice showed the \"central weakness\" of the PM's Brexit deal while the Lib Dems said it would leave the UK trapped in a \"Brexit hamster wheel\".\n\nDebate on Brexit deal continues\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sam Gyimah: Brexit negotiations have been set up for failure\n\nThe second of five days of debate on Mrs May's Brexit agreement is under way, focusing on security and immigration.\n\nThe government suffered three embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, on the role that MPs will play if Mrs May's deal is rejected as well as the disclosure of the legal advice.\n\nEx-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told MPs he could not support Mrs May's deal, saying it was too much of a \"gamble\" to sign up to EU rules when the UK did not know what it was getting in return.\n\n\"We put all our cards and all our money on the table and we wait for another two years for the EU to set the rules of the game.

But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nMrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked.\n\nIt included mental health professionals, academics and patients.\n\nThe 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including:\n\nnew rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment\n\nmore frequent opportunities to challenge detention\n\nlegally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned\n\na requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests\n\nan end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients\n\nthe right to choose a \"nominated person\" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative\n\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date.\n\n\"It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nIt is unclear why this has happened as the rates of severe mental illness have remained stable.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment.

Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.\n\n\"We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying.\n\nA previous analysis carried out earlier this year by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?\n\n\"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott.\n\n\"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\"\n\n\"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\"\n\nA number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate.

This will worry scientists as they had seen CO2 emissions relatively flat for the three years before.\n\nSo what's caused the rise?\n\nWhile coal use remains below the historically high level of 2013, it has grown again this year. China, the world's largest emitter saw emissions rise an estimated 4.7%.\n\nAt UN climate talks in Katowice, the lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the rise in China was down to government activity.\n\n\"For the past two years, the Chinese government has boosted the economy and the economy is based on construction and heavy industry, coal and steel. When you boost the economy you actually see a rise in emissions,\" she said.\n\nOther factors include a rise in the US after several years of decline, which the researchers say is due to a very cold winter and a hot summer driving up demand for energy.\n\nWho are the biggest emitters?\n\n2018's top ten has China on top, followed by the US and the EU as a whole region. After these three come India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada.\n\nA booming economy has seen India's emissions grow by 6.3%. Renewables are growing fast but from a low base.\n\nThe five countries contributing most to growth in global emissions outside of China, the US, the EU and India over the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea.\n\nClimate change: Where we are in seven charts\n\nWhat's happening with cars?\n\nOne common factor across rich and poor countries alike has been the continued rise in the consumption of oil in the transport sector. In the EU, the amount of fuel used for flights and road transport has surged by 4%. In US, use of coal actually fell while fossil fuels used in car journeys rose by 1.4%.\n\n\"Apart from the coal story, the emissions from oil use in cars and lorries and trucks and aviation have not been abated at all,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"They just keep rising and rising and that's associated with an increase in cars everywhere around the world.\"\n\nAccording to the experts, people are driving bigger petrol and diesel cars, travelling further than before, in more countries.\n\nWhat does this year's rise in CO2 mean?\n\nImage copyright Robert Alexander Image caption Electric car use is growing, but many think the transition is not happening fast enough\n\nIt's not good news, says the scientists, who argue that global emissions have to start to fall by 2020 if the world is to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nPeople are simply not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris climate agreement was signed.\n\n\"Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are not yet being matched by proportionate actions,\" said Dr Glen Peters, a Research Director at the CICERO Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who led the emissions analysis.\n\n\"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015.\"\n\nHow are people at COP24 reacting to the rise?\n\nIt is being seen here as another warning shot from the real world that negotiators really need to make progress.\n\n\"All the warm words spoken at the UN climate summit in Poland won't help prevent climate change,\" said Mohammed Adow, who's at the conference for Christian Aid.\n\n\"The climate does not respond to lofty rhetoric, it responds to carbon dioxide emission reductions.\n\n\"If this is the most important issue of our time, as leaders repeatedly say, then why aren't they acting accordingly - and showing up for the climate talks?\"\n\nIs anything being done to limit emissions from cars and trucks?\n\nDespite the gloomy picture on cars in 2018, the future is not so solid for the internal combustion engine.\n\nWhile they were rare 10 years ago, there are now three million plug-in cars in use globally.\n\nNorway will stop selling cars that are not electric in 2025. The UK, France, the Netherlands and India say they will stop before 2040.\n\nCar manufacturers are responding to the fork in the road.

Morocco, Mexico, Chile and Egypt are now producing solar energy for three US cents or less per kilowatt hour. That's cheaper than natural gas.\n\nMore than 50% of new electricity generating capacity being installed right now is green. Wind and solar are doubling every four years. Coal is going backwards in most of the developed world.\n\nWhile the US may not be staying in the Paris agreement, most US citizens live in a jurisdiction that still supports the Paris goals.\n\nAround the world, some 9,000 cities and municipalities representing some 16% of the world's population are committed to Paris.\n\nOver the past decade, 19 countries including the UK, Ireland, France and the US have all cut emissions while growing their economies.\n\n\"Before 2015, many people thought the Paris Agreement was impossible, yet thousands of people and institutions made the shift from impossible to unstoppable,\" wrote former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, in a commentary on the research.\n\n\"The same is true of decarbonising the economy.

It had lost the scales characteristic of its ancestors.\n\nThe ichthyosaur's outer layer is still somewhat flexible and retains evidence of the animal's camouflage pattern.\n\nThe reptile was counter-shaded - darker on the upper side and light on the underside. This counter-balances the shading effects of natural light, making the animal more difficult to see.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurs are interesting because they have many traits in common with dolphins, but are not at all closely related to those sea-dwelling mammals,\" said co-author Mary Schweitzer, professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU).\n\nTheir similar appearance suggests that ichthyosaurs and whales evolved similar strategies to adapt to marine life - an example of convergent evolution.\n\nProf Schweitzer said: \"They have many features in common with living marine reptiles like sea turtles, but we know from the fossil record that they gave live birth, which is associated with warm-bloodedness.\"\n\nMost reptiles today are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is determined by the warmth of their surroundings. Blubber helps some marine animals maintain a high body temperature regardless of the ocean water temperature.\n\nCo-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden, told BBC News: \"Blubber is found in living marine mammals but notably also adult individuals of the leatherback sea turtle. Its primary role in all of these animals seems to be insulation, and the leatherback is unique in many aspects.\n\nImage copyright Johan Lindgren / Martin Jarenmark Image caption Comparisons between artificially matured modern porpoise blubber and skin and the equivalent from a fossil ichthyosaur.\n\n\"It has metabolic rates that are higher than are those of typical reptiles, and a suite of measures for heat retention and control, and collectively these enable adult leatherbacks to venture into cold water environments.\n\n\"So, ichthyosaurs were able to control their body temperature at least as well as leatherbacks, but then it is hard to say if they were fully endothermic (warm-blooded) or not.\"\n\nThe researchers identified the blubber and skin remains on a well-preserved ichthyosaur specimen held by the Urweltmuseum Hauff in Germany. It was discovered in Holzmaden quarry, in the country's south-west, which has produced many other well-preserved fossils from the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe fossil was subjected to an exhaustive analysis of its microscopic structure and molecular composition.\n\n\"Both the body outline and remnants of internal organs are clearly visible,\" said co-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden.\n\n\"Remarkably, the fossil is so well-preserved that it is possible to observe individual cellular layers within its skin.\"\n\nThe researchers identified cell-like microstructures which probably held pigment, and an internal organ thought to be the animal's liver.\n\nThe blubber-like material contained fragments of fatty acid molecules.\n\n\"This is the first direct, chemical evidence for warm-bloodedness in an ichthyosaur, because blubber is a feature of warm-blooded animals,\" said Prof Schweitzer.\n\nTo provide additional support for this idea, the researchers artificially matured the blubber of a modern porpoise, exposing it to high temperatures and pressures - as it would be during the process of fossilisation.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: The fossil belongs to a type of ichthyosaur called Stenopterygius\n\nThe resulting \"matured\" porpoise blubber shared many features with the fossilised version.\n\nAs for the ichthyosaur's skin, the camouflage pattern would have provided protection from Jurassic predators such as flying pterosaurs, attacking from above, and pliosaurs (even bigger marine reptiles), which would have attacked from below.\n\nDr Lindgren said: \"Given the density of pigment cells, and the fact that they occur in both the epidermis and dermis, we hypothesise that ichthyosaurs had a really dark dorsal (upper) skin, which is also what you see in many extant whales that are deep divers (as ichthyosaurs) and venture into cold, arctic regions (as did ichthyosaurs).\n\n\"A melanic (dark) colouration would benefit ichthyosaurs as a UV protection while at the sea surface, but could perhaps also help ichthyosaurs thermoregulate as is the case in the leatherback sea turtle.\"\n\nLosing the scales and evolving smooth skin would also have helped ichthyosaurs manoeuvre more easily underwater.\n\nJohan Lindgren said the still-flexible skin meant the specimen must have been fossilised so fast that organic molecules were trapped inside the mineral component of the fossil.\n\n\"Soft tissues, such as skin, have hitherto been considered to be so labile (easily broken down) that the only way they can survive is via full replacement by minerals. However, as it turns out, when these minerals are removed, some of the original organics remain,\" Dr Lindgren explained.\n\nThe results are published in the journal Nature.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Game-on for UK's Team Tao in ocean XPRIZE final", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46449806", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Martin Avery Photography Image caption Team Tao's USV: Technologies have had to be developed in just three years\n\nA UK-based team has arrived in Greece for the grand final of a contest to find innovative solutions for seafloor mapping.\n\nThe Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE competition is offering multi-million dollar awards for the best concepts.\n\nParticipants have to chart at least 250 sq km of the Mediterranean at depths down to 4,000m, all inside 24 hours.\n\nTeam Tao, from Newcastle in the north of England, has developed a novel, low-cost, underwater robot.\n\nDeployed and collected by an un-crewed surface vessel (USV), this torpedo-like device is called a BEM, or Bathypelagic Excursion Module.

Every last disease, injury, and ailment that you can possibly have falls into one of the following classifications. Consult this list of the only four medical conditions to begin diagnosing your health problems.\n\n1. Fat\n\nThere are thousands of ways in which the medical condition of \u201cfat\u201d can manifest. Too fat? That\u2019s a fat problem. Too small? That\u2019s a fat problem. Pregnant? Also a fat problem. In fact, cases of fat are on the rise across the world, with doctors diagnosing patients as \u201clittle fellas gone big\u201d or \u201cbig boys gone slender\u201d with increasing regularity. Fat symptoms may come on suddenly and often include growing, shrinking, being of a size, and experiencing width.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Cancer\n\nIf you have to go to the doctor\u2019s office or hospital for any reason at all, you may be showing early signs of cancer. One of the biggest telltale signs that your body has developed cancer is being inside a health clinic where doctors and nurses are. Other urgent signs include baldness and laying in a bed, and if you find yourself experiencing these symptoms in tandem with each other, such as being bald and laying in a bed, contact a medical professional immediately to seek early treatment. It could save your life.\n\n3. No Legs\n\nOdds are, when you are feeling like your legs are not there, you\u2019re likely experiencing what medical researchers have referred to as \u201cno legs.\u201d This extremely common malady can make basic tasks such as stomping, kicking, wearing shoes, and sprinting across the desert abnormally difficult. Luckily, this condition is easily treated with legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Insane\n\nOut of the four health issues that there are, insanity is by far the most dire and easily contracted. Symptoms of insanity range in severity, the mildest of which include being a lunatic or the desire to be a maniac. The most extreme symptoms of being insane include having weird eyes, getting bad grades at school, and screaming. If you suffer from insanity, don\u2019t worry, because there are tons of people who are insane but still lead fully functional and happy lives, such as Sully Sullenberger, Missy Elliot, and Don Zimmer.

While expressing the US business community's satisfaction for the truce, he was quick to note that a long road lies ahead.\n\n\"This outcome delays further escalation and gets both sides back on track to find a sustainable long-term solution to the challenges in the relationship,\" Parker said.\n\nBut others said the pause itself should not be underestimated.\n\nZhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University, called the trade thaw an extremely positive development that offers a chance to avert a broader crisis between the two sides.\n\nThe conflict isn't just about increasing tariffs, but also different ideas and positions taken by China and the US,\" Zhu said.\n\n\"As the relationship worsens, the result will be more than just a trade war,\" he added, pointing to the tighter controls on Chinese students heading to the US as an example of deepening hostility.\n\nIn June, the US State Department curbed visa lengths for Chinese graduates studying aviation, robotics and advanced manufacturing to one year from five, citing national security concerns.\n\n\"Growing negative sentiments between China and the US is the most frightening factor in China-US relations,\" Zhu said. \"So the temporary truce is really important to alleviate increasing opposition between the two countries.\"\n\nShi Yinhong, a professor in Beijing\u2019s Renmin University, had a more somber outlook. \"It's not a big deal. If negotiation fails after 90 days, things will get worse,\" he said.\n\nShi argued that reaching a broader agreement depends on the flexibility of the US side.\n\n\"If Trump is very harsh with his demands, then meeting those demands would mean tremendous changes to China's national affairs and industrial policies,\" Shi said. \"It will decrease the chance of the Chinese government accepting them.\"\n\nMany analysts see the tight, 90-day negotiating window as short when taking into account the US list of demands, which is believed to include requirements for China to act on issues such as forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers and alleged cyber theft.\n\nIn a statement last month, the US Trade Representative's office said China was continuing \"unfair practices\", alleging that Beijing's IP and technology transfer policies are causing multibillion dollar worth of damages to US companies.\n\n\"It is unreasonable to assume that all challenges in the relationship can be resolved in 90 days,\" said Parker, adding that setting medium- and long-term targets, as well, is the best way to \"ensure sustainable engagement between the two sides\".\n\nChinese action\n\nDespite the persisting scepticism, the Chinese commerce ministry on Wednesday expressed its \"confidence\" that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.\n\n\"China will start with the implementation of the specific matters in which consensus has been reached, the sooner the better,\" it said in a statement, without providing more details.\n\n181130130736067\n\nAlready, just days after the temporary ceasefire, China has announced a number of significant steps, including a slew of penalties for intellectual property theft that could restrict companies' access to borrowing and state-funding.

Trump also tweeted that China had \"agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US\" - currently the duties stand at 40 percent. Details on this, however, have been scarce, and Beijing has not confirmed the move.\n\n'Negative sentiment'\n\nWhether or not the US and China can transform vague commitments into concrete outcomes over the next 90 days, however, remains unclear. But what is certain, Shi said, is that stakes are high.\n\n\"If an agreement isn't reached, there will be significant losses for China\" and \"damage done to both the US and Chinese economy,\" he says.\n\nSo far, China has managed to avoid any major economic fallout from the trade war.\n\n\"Ironically, we've so far seen the opposite,\" said Polk, noting how companies have rushed to pump up orders to beat tariff deadlines. \"Of course, if we see the 25 percent in tariffs implemented this will turn on its head.\"\n\n\u201cMost Chinese exporters say, '10 percent is no big deal, we can eat that. But 25 percent, we're going to have a problem with'.

Trade tensions with the US are taking place against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and lower state revenue.\n\n\"The trade has increased the pressure on China's economy,\" Shi said. \"And there are psychological impacts,\" he said, referring to an increasingly worried Chinese population.\n\nIt's a view echoed by Polk.\n\n\"Already, there's this feeling of domestic uncertainty, policies not working, a hurting private sector ... and then you throw the trade war on top.\n\n\"It's absolutely more of a very negative sentiment out there.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Trump, the CIA and the future of torture", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2018/11/trump-cia-future-torture-181126115516181.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Former United States President Barack Obama wanted to close it down.

Indeed, to make this visit we had to sign a long document agreeing to restrictions. We were accompanied by a military minder at the base who vetted our footage at the end of each day.\n\nWe could, however, observe legal proceedings under strict conditions, in a specially constructed gallery separated from the court by soundproof glass. To hear what was happening, we watched a monitor on a 40-second delay, designed to prevent any inadvertent leak of classified information. When classified information is discussed, the court is closed to the public.\n\nThere is no time limit placed on the process, which is geared toward fairness, rather than an arbitrary deadline. US Department of Defence\n\nAs the week at Camp Justice unfolded, defence lawyers described their frustrations. One of the allegations being that pre-trial hearings have become mired in arguments about what classified information they're allowed to see. In particular, evidence from the post 9/11 programme of so-called \"enhanced interrogation\".\n\nJames Connell represents Ammar al-Baluchi, accused of helping to supply funding to the 9/11 hijackers. Connell's claim that \"strict controls\" on the legal process at Guantanamo are designed to \"prevent information about torture getting out to the public.\"\n\nThe view of Lieutenant Colonel Derek Poteet, a defence lawyer representing the alleged mastermind of 9/11, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed - that the US Government was \"trying to hide so very much\" leading to an \"interminable delay\" in the 9/11 cases coming to trial.\n\n161215090224679\n\nThe US Government invites relatives of the victims of 9/11 to attend open sessions of the military court hearings through a ballot system. We spoke to a group who had made the journey to Guantanamo to observe a 30th pre-trial hearing this July. There were a range of opinions, some expressing pride in the process, but there was genuine concern from several about the prospect of the death penalty in the cases. One suggestion - that a plea bargain, in exchange for dropping the death penalty, might speed up the proceedings, and lead to closure.\n\nFor their part, the US Department of Defence told us that they strove to ensure the process is \"as transparent as possible when balanced with requirements of national security,\" and that \"there is no time limit placed on the process, which is geared toward fairness, rather than an arbitrary deadline\".\n\nThe future of Gitmo\n\nAway from the secret court, a whistle-stop military tour took us to the exterior of Camp 6 where most remaining prisoners are held. So-called high-value detainees are imprisoned in Camp 7, a prison we weren't allowed to film, its location a state secret.\n\nWe tried to elicit information about the future from spokesperson, Commander Anne Leanos. There were hopes, she said, of constructing a new prison, Camp 8 which would update facilities for an \"ageing high-value detainee population.\" Given a \"new direction\" they were also now preparing for \"an enduring mission\".\n\nWe asked her what she made of her commander in chief's stated views that \"torture works\". She said she couldn't comment.\n\nThe nature of the \"enduring mission\" at Guantanamo and President Trump's vow to \"load it up\" may remain a matter for the future. But of particular consequence to some still held here is another of President Trump's vows.\n\nIn January 2017, as president-elect, Trump tweeted that there should be \"no more releases from GITMO\".\n\nAnd this was ominous news for five prisoners, cleared for release under President Obama.\n\nCleared but still jailed\n\nWe travelled to Morocco to meet the family of one of those men, still held on the US Naval base.\n\nAbdul Latif Nasser's lawyers say he was sold for a bounty and imprisoned in Guantanamo in 2002. The US said he had links with extremists, but no charges were ever brought. Then, in 2016 his case was heard by a Guantanamo Periodic Review Board, a body containing representatives from six US agencies, including the Department of Defence. They cleared him for release, but after bureaucratic delays, he remains, to this day, imprisoned.\n\nMustafa Nasser, Abdul Latif's Uncle, told us how sixteen years on the family still hope for his return, a home waiting for him in Casablanca.\n\nIn London, we met Clive Stafford Smith whose organisation Reprieve has represented 80 prisoners released from Guantanamo.\n\nWhen it comes to those cleared for release, but still jailed under Trump, his contention: \"They're not letting anyone go, for purely political reasons.\"\n\nTorture and the Future\n\nThe US Department of Defence did not reply to our questions about the process at Guantanamo, whereby prisoners cleared for release, might now be freed. The White House also declined to explain President Trump's views on torture.\n\nFor critics though, President Trump's stated view that \"torture works\" makes it even more vital that warnings are sounded about the future.\n\n\"If you don't know what history is, you'll repeat mistakes,\" says Clive Stafford Smith. \"We have someone in the White House right now who is liable to repeat any mistake.\n\n\"We need the truth out there.\"\n\nEditor's note: The filmmakers with like to thank researcher Manon Joly for her contribution to this documentary.\n\n\n\n"}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

A small percentage of accounts included scrambled payment card data, Kim said.\n\nMarriott acquired Starwood in 2016 for $13.6 billion, including the Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Aloft, Le Meridien, Tribute, Four Points and Luxury Collection hotel brands, forming the world\u2019s largest hotel operator.\n\n\u200bHack started in 2014\n\nThe hack began in 2014, shortly after an attack on the U.S. government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised sensitive data on tens of millions of employees, including application forms for security clearances.\n\nWhite House National Security advisor John Bolton recently told reporters he believed Beijing was behind the OPM hack, a claim first made by the United States in 2015.\n\nBeijing has strongly denied those charges and also refuted charges that it was behind other hacks.\n\nFormer senior FBI official Robert Anderson told Reuters that the Marriott case looked similar to hacks that the Chinese government was conducting in 2014 as part of its intelligence operations.\n\n\u201cThink of the depth of knowledge they could now have about travel habits or who happened to be in a certain city at the same time as another person,\u201d said Anderson, who served as FBI executive assistant director until 2015.\n\n\u201cIt fits with how the Chinese intelligence services think about things. It\u2019s all very long range,\u201d said Anderson, who was not involved in investigating the Marriott case and is now a principal with Chertoff Group.\n\nIdentity theft not likely\n\nMichael Sussmann, a former senior Department of Justice official for its computer crimes section, said that the long duration of the campaign was an indicator that the hackers were seeking data for intelligence and not information to use in cyber crime schemes.\n\n\u201cOne clue pointing to a government attacker is the amount of time the intruders were working quietly inside the network,\u201d he said. \u201cPatience is a virtue for spies, but not for criminals trying to steal credit card numbers.\u201d\n\nFBI representatives could not immediately be reached for comment on the evidence linking the attack to China.

He was forced to resign after news surfaced that he had lied to administration officials about his talks with Sergey Kislyak, former Russian ambassador to Washington, during the presidential transition.\n\nFlynn had drawn investigators' scrutiny before he ran afoul of the FBI in January 2017. While serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, he lobbied for a Dutch company linked to the Turkish government without registering as a foreign agent.\n\n\n\nFlynn began cooperating with the special counsel after pleading guilty to lying to federal agents about his conversations with Kislyak. He became the first of five former Trump associates who have entered guilty pleas with the special counsel's office.\n\n\n\nThe sentencing recommendation by Mueller, if approved by a federal judge later this month, could spell an end to Flynn\u2019s legal troubles. Sentencing is set for Dec. 18.\n\nBut as part of his agreement with the special counsel, Flynn is required to testify \u201cat any and all trials\u201d where his testimony is deemed relevant.\n\nVon Spakovsky said that while the Mueller investigation remains cloaked in secrecy, it is unlikely to wrap up by year\u2019s end and could well drag on as late as next spring. He said he expects the special counsel to write a report on his findings at some point next year without issuing any major indictments.\n\nTrump recently provided the special counsel with written answers about his knowledge of the Russian interference, raising speculation that Mueller's team may have received what they need to complete their report.\n\nBut recent developments in the probe paint a different picture.\n\nLast week, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, and prosecutors revealed that Cohen had spent 70 hours in interviews with investigators.\n\nOn Friday, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are expected to disclose how former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u201crepeatedly lied\u201d to them in recent weeks in breach of a cooperation agreement.\n\n\u201cSo all of that tells me that this is very complicated, that there is more to come,\u201d said Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University School of Public Affairs. \"I would not expect Mueller\u2019s investigation or the other investigations that are referred to in the Flynn sentencing memo to end anytime soon. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get more information, but I don\u2019t see things wrapping up.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Weighs In on Climate Change", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-weighs-in-on-climate-change/4687607.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "\"I'm not going to put the country out of business trying to maintain certain standards that probably don't matter,\" President Donald Trump told VOA when asked about the economic impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nWhen not denying its existence, the Trump administration's approach to\n\nclimate change essentially comes down to three arguments: the United States has already cut its greenhouse gas emissions more than other countries, regardless of any international agreement; regulations to cut emissions come with high costs and few benefits; and those regulations would put the United States at a disadvantage because other countries will not follow.\n\n\"When you look at China, and when you look at other countries where they have foul air,\" Trump added, \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money.\"\n\n\n\nAs U.N. climate negotiations get under way in Poland to work out rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement -- from which Trump intends to withdraw the United States -- experts weigh in on the administration's claims.\n\nEmissions cuts\n\n\n\nIt's true that the United States has reduced its greenhouse gas production more than any other country. U.S. emissions peaked in 2005. In the last decade, they have fallen by about 13 percent, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\n\n\nBut the United States was the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases until 2006. And, others have made bigger cuts by percentage. Hungary's levels, for example, decreased 14 percent.\n\n\n\nU.S. emissions started to fall when the fracking boom took off.\n\n\n\nThe new technique of hydraulic fracturing turned the United States into a major natural gas producer. As the price of natural gas has dropped, it has been steadily replacing coal as the dominant fuel for electricity generation. Because burning natural gas produces far less carbon dioxide than coal, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased.\n\n\n\nMore recently, renewable sources such as solar and wind power have started to make inroads on the power grid.\n\nWhile U.S. emissions have fallen since the 2000s, China's have soared.\n\n\n\nThe country pursued astonishing economic growth with an enormous investment in coal-fired power plants. China is now the leading producer of greenhouse gases by far, roughly doubling U.S. output.\n\n\n\nCost-benefit\n\nTrump has argued that regulations aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions would hobble the U.S. economy. He has moved to undo the Obama administration's proposed rules on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, among others.\n\n\n\nCritics question whether those regulations would cost as much Trump suggests.\n\n\n\n\"None of these policies were going to have dramatic increases in the prices that consumers would see,\" Duke University public policy professor Billy Pizer said. He added that normal price swings would likely swamp the cost of the regulations Trump targets.\n\nThe emissions reductions the Obama administration pledged in Paris \"were built largely on a continuation of the coal-to-gas transition and a continuation of growth in renewable energy that's already happening,\" said Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute research center. As such, he added, they \"don't imply a large cost. In fact, they imply a marginal increased benefit to the U.S.\"\n\n\n\nThose benefits come, for example, because burning less coal produces less air pollution, which lowers health costs.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the direct results of climate change: wildfires, floods, droughts and so on.\n\n\n\n\"We have enough science and enough economics to show that there are damages resulting from us releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. We know that that is not a free thing,\" University of Chicago public policy professor Amir Jina said. \"And yet, we are artificially setting it as free because we're not paying the price of that externality.\"\n\n\n\nHe said economists nearly unanimously support a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program or some other way to put a price on carbon emissions.\n\nCollective action\n\nFew nations have taken the necessary steps to meet the emissions reduction pledges they made in Paris, according to the most recent United Nations emissions gap report.\n\nEven those pledges would fall far short of the Paris goal of limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, the report adds. Reaching that target will take \"unprecedented and urgent action.\" A 2016 report said an additional $5.2 trillion investment in renewable energy will be necessary worldwide over the next 25 years.\n\n\n\nTrump's statement -- \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money\" -- sums up why nations are reluctant to act: no one wants to take on burdens that they think others won't.\n\n\n\n\"It's the thing which has been dogging action on climate change for generations,\" Jina said.\n\n\n\n\"We only really solve the problem if everybody acts together,\" he added. \"And if enough people are not acting, then we don't.\"\n\n\n\nParis depends on countries following through on increasingly ambitious emissions cuts.\n\n\n\nEach country decides what it is willing to do. Every five years, countries come together and show their progress.\n\n\n\n\"You over time build confidence in each other,\" Pizer said. \"Ideally, you ratchet up the commitments as you see your actions reciprocated by other countries.\"\n\nTrump's backpedaling on the U.S. commitment raises questions about the prospects.\n\n\n\nHowever, the first of these check-ins is five years away. Trump can't formally withdraw the United States from the agreement until 2020.\n\n\n\nPizer notes that the predecessor to the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, failed in part because it imposed caps on countries' carbon emissions, and most of the world balked.\n\n\n\n\"In my mind, this is the best we can do,\" he said. \"If there were a different way to do it, I'd be all over that.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Nation Pauses Wednesday to Mourn Former US President George H.W.

Others, including the West African coast or that off the Caribbean, remain largely blank.\n\nThe introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty, allowed countries to determine their continental shelves and exclusive economic zones, legitimate territorial claims off their coasts.\n\nIt also spurred a rush to map and claim land, Larter said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest land grab in recent history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Julian Barbiere of UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, it would be a \u201cparadox\u201d if, after collaboration at a scientific and technical level to share data, countries used that knowledge against each other in geopolitical spats.\n\n\u201cThere are already tensions in some parts of the world, and one of the reasons for that is access to resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSome countries, he added, are reluctant to give up strategic proprietary data to the Seabed 2030 project, largely because of national security concerns or in areas with sensitive geopolitical tensions, such as the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is already a lot of data, which is sitting there but it\u2019s not being released. We hope to change attitudes and to really get countries to contribute,\u201d Barbiere said.\n\nThe next phase of the project, he said, is to encourage data donors and crowdsourcing, not just from exploration vessels but from cargo ships, recreational sea-users and fishing boats.\n\n\u201c(It) goes back to this principle: the ocean is an international space by definition ... part of the common heritage of mankind,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, in a bid to meet the U.N.

That follows a 1.6 percent rise last year. However, emissions were stable for the three years before that.\n\n\"Possibly, this year is unusual,\" said lead author Corinne Le Quere at the University of East Anglia. But probably not, she added. \"We think that emissions are probably still going to go up for some years unless things change drastically.\"\n\n\"I'm not that surprised,\" said Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute research center, who was not involved in the research. \"The world economy is growing, and the cheapest, most scalable easiest way to meet much of that growth still comes from incumbent fossil fuel technologies.\"\n\nProjected emissions from China, the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, rose by 4.7 percent this year. Le Quere said a government effort to boost construction and stimulate the economy increased demand for emissions-intensive steel, aluminum and cement.\n\nIn the United States, coal continued to give way to cleaner natural gas. But a cold winter and a hot summer both raised energy demands, contributing to an estimated 2.5 percent increase in emissions.\n\nRising oil use for transportation also was a factor, as American consumers are once again buying bigger cars.\n\nEmissions declined by 0.7 percent in the 28-nation European Union, though emissions from oil increased.\n\nThe transportation sector is the \"biggest problem, I would say, worldwide,\" Le Quere added. \"We are really not making a dent in emissions from transport, in spite of the fact that the technology for electric cars is there.\"\n\nThe good news is that renewable energy is growing by leaps and bounds. That should help take the edge off the emissions curve, even as growth picks up in another Asian giant \u2014 India.\n\n\"We're not going to see what we saw in China in the early 2000s\" when that country overtook, and then doubled, emissions of the previous leader, the United States, she said.\n\nTrembath cautions, however, that Africa remains a question mark. \"We see China- and India-like growth numbers, 5 to 10 percent annual GDP growth, coming from a lot of sub-Saharan African countries,\" he said. \"That could mean a lot more oil consumption, a lot more natural gas consumption.\"\n\nThat's not a bad thing on many levels, he added. \"These are desperately poor countries that are just trying to achieve the same standard of living we enjoy in the United States.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Trump Weighs In on Climate Change", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-weighs-in-on-climate-change/4687607.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "\"I'm not going to put the country out of business trying to maintain certain standards that probably don't matter,\" President Donald Trump told VOA when asked about the economic impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nWhen not denying its existence, the Trump administration's approach to\n\nclimate change essentially comes down to three arguments: the United States has already cut its greenhouse gas emissions more than other countries, regardless of any international agreement; regulations to cut emissions come with high costs and few benefits; and those regulations would put the United States at a disadvantage because other countries will not follow.\n\n\"When you look at China, and when you look at other countries where they have foul air,\" Trump added, \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money.\"\n\n\n\nAs U.N. climate negotiations get under way in Poland to work out rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement -- from which Trump intends to withdraw the United States -- experts weigh in on the administration's claims.\n\nEmissions cuts\n\n\n\nIt's true that the United States has reduced its greenhouse gas production more than any other country. U.S. emissions peaked in 2005. In the last decade, they have fallen by about 13 percent, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\n\n\nBut the United States was the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases until 2006. And, others have made bigger cuts by percentage. Hungary's levels, for example, decreased 14 percent.\n\n\n\nU.S. emissions started to fall when the fracking boom took off.\n\n\n\nThe new technique of hydraulic fracturing turned the United States into a major natural gas producer. As the price of natural gas has dropped, it has been steadily replacing coal as the dominant fuel for electricity generation. Because burning natural gas produces far less carbon dioxide than coal, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased.\n\n\n\nMore recently, renewable sources such as solar and wind power have started to make inroads on the power grid.\n\nWhile U.S. emissions have fallen since the 2000s, China's have soared.\n\n\n\nThe country pursued astonishing economic growth with an enormous investment in coal-fired power plants. China is now the leading producer of greenhouse gases by far, roughly doubling U.S. output.\n\n\n\nCost-benefit\n\nTrump has argued that regulations aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions would hobble the U.S. economy. He has moved to undo the Obama administration's proposed rules on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, among others.\n\n\n\nCritics question whether those regulations would cost as much Trump suggests.\n\n\n\n\"None of these policies were going to have dramatic increases in the prices that consumers would see,\" Duke University public policy professor Billy Pizer said. He added that normal price swings would likely swamp the cost of the regulations Trump targets.\n\nThe emissions reductions the Obama administration pledged in Paris \"were built largely on a continuation of the coal-to-gas transition and a continuation of growth in renewable energy that's already happening,\" said Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute research center. As such, he added, they \"don't imply a large cost. In fact, they imply a marginal increased benefit to the U.S.\"\n\n\n\nThose benefits come, for example, because burning less coal produces less air pollution, which lowers health costs.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the direct results of climate change: wildfires, floods, droughts and so on.\n\n\n\n\"We have enough science and enough economics to show that there are damages resulting from us releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. We know that that is not a free thing,\" University of Chicago public policy professor Amir Jina said. \"And yet, we are artificially setting it as free because we're not paying the price of that externality.\"\n\n\n\nHe said economists nearly unanimously support a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program or some other way to put a price on carbon emissions.\n\nCollective action\n\nFew nations have taken the necessary steps to meet the emissions reduction pledges they made in Paris, according to the most recent United Nations emissions gap report.\n\nEven those pledges would fall far short of the Paris goal of limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, the report adds. Reaching that target will take \"unprecedented and urgent action.\" A 2016 report said an additional $5.2 trillion investment in renewable energy will be necessary worldwide over the next 25 years.\n\n\n\nTrump's statement -- \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money\" -- sums up why nations are reluctant to act: no one wants to take on burdens that they think others won't.\n\n\n\n\"It's the thing which has been dogging action on climate change for generations,\" Jina said.\n\n\n\n\"We only really solve the problem if everybody acts together,\" he added. \"And if enough people are not acting, then we don't.\"\n\n\n\nParis depends on countries following through on increasingly ambitious emissions cuts.\n\n\n\nEach country decides what it is willing to do. Every five years, countries come together and show their progress.\n\n\n\n\"You over time build confidence in each other,\" Pizer said. \"Ideally, you ratchet up the commitments as you see your actions reciprocated by other countries.\"\n\nTrump's backpedaling on the U.S. commitment raises questions about the prospects.\n\n\n\nHowever, the first of these check-ins is five years away. Trump can't formally withdraw the United States from the agreement until 2020.\n\n\n\nPizer notes that the predecessor to the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, failed in part because it imposed caps on countries' carbon emissions, and most of the world balked.\n\n\n\n\"In my mind, this is the best we can do,\" he said. \"If there were a different way to do it, I'd be all over that.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Gorillas, Given a Puzzle, Find Way to Cheat", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/gorillas-in-experiment-given-a-puzzle-find-a-way-to-cheat/4687346.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Gorillas at a zoo in England have demonstrated a distinctly human trait while attempting to solve a puzzle: cheating.\n\n\n\nThe gorillas were presented with a wall-mounted puzzle that requires the user to guide a peanut through a series of obstacles by poking a stick through various holes.

displaced by 2050 as a result of global warming.\n\n\n\nAmong the countries being significantly hit by climate-linked extreme weather is the United States, whose President Donald Trump is one of the most prominent skeptics of man-made climate change, the agency said.\n\nHurricanes and storms in the United States and Caribbean caused more than $220 billion worth of damage last year, representing nearly two-thirds of global losses caused by natural disasters in 2017, OCHA said.\n\n\n\n\"Climate events are contributing to greater humanitarian problems than we have seen in the past,\" said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for OCHA. \"This is something the world has not yet adapted fully to.\"\n\n\n\nAs hurricanes and tropical cyclones intensify in strength, they are particularly hurting poor nations that are unprepared for the threat, researchers said on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Poland.\n\n\n\nIn the tiny island country of Dominica, Maria caused losses equal to more than twice its gross domestic product, damaging or destroying about 90 percent of housing.\n\n\n\nLloyd Pascal, a Dominican climate negotiator whose home has yet to be fully repaired after being hit by the storm, urged the U.N. talks to pay more attention to \"weaker countries.\"\n\n\n\nDominica, with 72,000 people, lacks the ability to prepare for the increasingly severe weather it is suffering, he said.\n\n\n\nEven though storm warnings are received, the state does not have resources to evacuate people into shelters, he said, nor understand clearly how heavy rainfall will boost river levels.\n\n\n\n\"We are just not prepared to do that kind of work,\" he told reporters. \"We are like sitting ducks.\"\n\n\n\nBut rich countries, including the United States, also are seeing clearer climate impacts, and need to step up efforts to keep their people safe, Germanwatch said.\n\n\n\n\"Effective climate protection, as well as increasing resilience, is ... in the self-interest of these countries,\" Eckstein said.\n\n\n\nThe Germanwatch index highlighted other types of weather-related damage as well, from unusually heavy rainfall to landslides.\n\nSri Lanka, the second most-affected country in 2017, saw dramatic floods that year that killed 200 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. climate negotiations should drum up more support for the poorest countries like Nepal, Vietnam, Sierra Leone and Madagascar to deal with rising losses linked to climate change, Germanwatch said.\n\n\n\nAll four of those countries figured in the index's top 10 of nations most affected by weather disasters in 2017.\n\n\n\n\"They need predictable and reliable financial support for dealing with climate-induced loss and damage,\" Eckstein said.\n\n\n\nFive years ago, the U.N. climate talks set up a mechanism to better understand the damage that now will be unavoidable as a result of the 1 degree Celsius hike in global temperatures that has already occurred.\n\n\n\nThe mechanism also seeks to find ways to deal with the consequences as the world warms further.\n\n\n\nBut industrialized countries \u2014 which have historically emitted the most climate-changing emissions \u2014 have refused to pay compensation to those who are less to blame for global warming yet find themselves on the front line of impacts.\n\n\n\nInstead, they are providing access to insurance.\n\n\n\nAt the Dec. 2-14 talks in Poland, arguments are expected over how progress on dealing with \"loss and damage\" should be assessed in 2023, when countries measure

It expects the ocean economy to contribute $3 trillion to the world economy by 2030, up from $1.5 trillion in 2010.\n\nPolitical rifts\n\nSome parts of the oceans \u2014 the East Coast of the United States, areas around Japan, New Zealand and Ireland \u2014 are relatively well-mapped, experts said. Others, including the West African coast or that off the Caribbean, remain largely blank.\n\nThe introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty, allowed countries to determine their continental shelves and exclusive economic zones, legitimate territorial claims off their coasts.\n\nIt also spurred a rush to map and claim land, Larter said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest land grab in recent history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Julian Barbiere of UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, it would be a \u201cparadox\u201d if, after collaboration at a scientific and technical level to share data, countries used that knowledge against each other in geopolitical spats.\n\n\u201cThere are already tensions in some parts of the world, and one of the reasons for that is access to resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSome countries, he added, are reluctant to give up strategic proprietary data to the Seabed 2030 project, largely because of national security concerns or in areas with sensitive geopolitical tensions, such as the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is already a lot of data, which is sitting there but it\u2019s not being released. We hope to change attitudes and to really get countries to contribute,\u201d Barbiere said.\n\nThe next phase of the project, he said, is to encourage data donors and crowdsourcing, not just from exploration vessels but from cargo ships, recreational sea-users and fishing boats.\n\n\u201c(It) goes back to this principle: the ocean is an international space by definition ... part of the common heritage of mankind,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, in a bid to meet the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans \u2014 mapping will take center stage during negotiations to be completed by 2020, as nations create a new, legally binding treaty to protect the high seas.\n\n\u201cThere are so many benefits to knowing more about the ocean floor,\u201d Hasebe said. \u201cHumanity as a whole would be able to benefit.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Australian Bid for Encrypted Data Passes First Hurdle", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-bid-for-encrypted-data-passes-first-hurdle/4688991.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The Australian parliament\u2019s lower house Thursday passed a bill to force tech firms such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Facebook and Apple to give police access to encrypted data, pushing it closer to becoming a precedent-setting law.\n\nHowever, the proposal, staunchly opposed by the tech giants because Australia is seen as a test case as other nations explore similar rules, faces a sterner test in the upper house Senate, where privacy and information security concerns are sticking points.\n\nThe bill provides for fines of up to A$10 million ($7.3 million) for institutions and prison terms for individuals for failing to hand over data linked to suspected illegal activities.\n\nLabor party concerns\n\nEarlier in the week it appeared set to secure enough support from both major political parties, with some amendments, to secure passage.

companies, including Netflix and Airbnb, access users' lists of friends after it cut off that data for most other apps around 2015, according to documents released on Wednesday by a British lawmaker investigating fake news and social media.\n\nThe 223 pages of internal communication from 2012 to 2015 between high-level employees, including founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, provide new evidence of previously aired contentions that Facebook has picked favorites and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.\n\nThe documents show that Facebook tracked growth of competitors and denied them access to user data available to others.\n\nIn 2014, the company identified about 100 apps as being either \"Mark's friends\" or \"Sheryl's friends\" and also tracked how many apps were spending money on Facebook ads, according to the documents, referring to Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nThe insight into the thinking of Facebook executives over that period could invite new regulatory scrutiny into its business practices.\n\nFacebook said it stood by its deliberations and decisions, but noted that it would relax one \"out-of-date\" policy that restricted competitors' use of its data.\n\nOne document said such competitor apps had previously needed Zuckerberg's approval before using tools Facebook makes available to app developers.\n\nZuckerberg wrote in a post on Wednesday that the company could have prevented the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal had it cracked down on app developers a year earlier in 2014.\n\nMisuse of Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, along with another data breach this year and revelations about Facebook's lobbying tactics have heightened government scrutiny globally on the company's privacy

restrictions on how Facebook operates, over time.\"\n\nDamian Collins, a Conservative British parliamentarian who leads a committee on media and culture, made the internal documents public after demanding them last month under threat of sanction from Six4Three.\n\nThe defunct app developer obtained them as part of its ongoing lawsuit in California state court alleging that Facebook violated promises to app developers when it ended their access to likes, photos and other data of users' friends in 2015.\n\nFacebook, which has described the Six4Three case as baseless, said the released communications were \"selectively leaked\" and it defended its practices.\n\n'Whitelisted' for Access to friends' data\n\nThough filed under seal and redacted in the lawsuit, the internal communications needed to be made public because \"they raise important questions about how Facebook treats users' data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market,\" Collins said on Twitter.\n\nDating app Badoo and ride-hailing app Lyft were among other companies 'whitelisted' for access to data about users' friends, the documents showed.\n\nLyft wanted to show carpool riders their mutual friends as an \"ice breaker,\" even if those friends were not using Lyft, according to one email. Facebook said in an email that it approved the request because it would add to a feeling of \"safety\" for riders.\n\nFacebook described such deals as short-term extensions, but it is unclear exactly when the various agreements ended. Netflix, Airbnb, Lyft and Badoo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe documents show an exchange between Zuckerberg and senior executive Justin Osofsky in 2013, in which they decided to stop giving friends' list access to Vine on the day that social media rival Twitter Inc launched the video-sharing service.\n\n\"We've prepared reactive PR,\" Osofsky wrote, to which Zuckerberg replied, \"Yup, go for it.\" Twitter declined to comment.\n\nFriends' data had stoked the growth of many apps because it enabled people to easily connect with Facebook buddies on a new service.\n\nFacebook weighed charging other apps for access to its developer tools, including the friends lists, if they did not buy a certain amount of advertising from Facebook, according to the emails. In one from 2012, Zuckerberg wrote that he was drawing inspiration for business models from books he had been reading about the banking industry.\n\nFacebook said it ultimately maintained free access to the tools."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "EU Steps Up Fight Against 'Fake News' Ahead of Elections", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-steps-up-fight-against-fake-news-ahead-of-elections/4688013.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "European Union authorities want internet companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter to file monthly reports on their progress eradicating \"fake news\" campaigns from their platforms ahead of elections next year.\n\nOfficials from the EU's executive Commission unveiled the measures Wednesday as part of an action plan to counter disinformation in the lead up to the continent-wide vote in the spring.\n\nThe internet companies will have to submit their reports from January until May, when hundreds of millions of people in 27 EU member countries are scheduled to vote for 705 lawmakers in the bloc's parliament.\n\nThe Commission singled out Russia.\n\n\"There is strong evidence pointing to Russia as a primary source of disinformation in Europe,\" said Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip.\n\nMany EU member countries have taken action to combat disinformation, but now \"we need to work together and coordinate our efforts,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities have repeatedly rejected Western accusations of sponsoring disinformation campaigns and described them as part of Western efforts to smear the country.\n\nOther measures include a new \"rapid alert system,\" beefing up budgets, and adding expert staff and data analysis tools.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, Twitter and browser maker Mozilla are the companies that so far have signed up to a voluntary EU code of conduct on fighting disinformation.\n\nThey'll be expected to report on how they're carrying out commitments they made under the code, including their work on making political advertising more transparent and how many fake and bot accounts they have identified and shut down.

Current Gov. Scott Walker, who narrowly lost re-election to Evers last month, is expected to sign the package into law.\n\nBut Johnson, the senior senator from Wisconsin, downplayed its impact and expressed confidence about any potential consequences Republicans may face.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, it depends on how much you guys blow it out of proportion, I suppose,\u201d Johnson told reporters when asked if he\u2019s concerned about a voter backlash.\n\nHe added that Walker had vetoed the proposals earlier this year, \u201cso this is really what [they] wanted to do for quite some period of time.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Republicans claim they are simply making long overdue reforms to restore the balance of power between the legislature and the executive.

(AP) \u2014 The incoming Democratic governor of Wisconsin said Wednesday that he plans to make a personal appeal to his defeated rival, Gov. Scott Walker, to veto far-reaching GOP legislation that would restrict the new administration\u2019s powers.\n\nWisconsin Republicans pushed through protests, internal disagreement and Democratic opposition to pass the bills after an all-night session. The measures would shift power to the GOP-controlled Legislature and weaken the authority of the office Republicans will lose in January.\n\n\u201cThe will of the people has officially been ignored by the Legislature,\u201d Gov.-elect Tony Evers said, adding that the lawmakers\u2019 actions \u201ctake us back to Nov. 6,\u201d before the election was finalized.\n\n\u201cWisconsin should be embarrassed by this,\u201d Evers said.\n\nHe said he will talk to Walker as soon as the bills reach his desk and that if he cannot persuade the governor to veto the proposals, he will consider lawsuits and any other option \u201cto make sure that this legislation does not get into practice.\u201d\n\nThe early morning votes were the height of a rare lame-duck legislative session. Walker has signaled his support for the bills. He has 10 days to sign the package after it\u2019s delivered to his office.\n\nThe session unfolded a month after Republicans were battered in the midterm election. They lost all statewide races amid strong Democratic turnout. But they retained legislative majorities thanks to what Democrats say are gerrymandered districts that tilt the map.\n\nA Walker spokeswoman said the governor, who was in Washington for former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s funeral, would not have any public comment Wednesday.\n\nThe new legislation tries to protect some of the GOP\u2019s achievements in recent years, including a work requirement for some people receiving state health care and the state\u2019s role in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act. The bills could also make it harder for Evers to renegotiate a $3 billion subsidy for a Foxconn electronics manufacturing facility, a deal spearheaded by Walker.\n\nIn neighboring Michigan, Republicans who control the Legislature voted to advance a measure that strips campaign-finance oversight power from the next secretary of state, a Democrat. They also moved to give lawmakers authority to stand up for GOP-backed laws if they think the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general are not adequately defending the state\u2019s interests.\n\nThe Wisconsin legislation passed in a session marked by stops and starts as GOP leaders tried to muster enough votes in the Senate. That chamber ultimately approved the package 17-16, with just one Republican voting against it, around sunrise. The Assembly approved it on a 56-27 vote about two hours later, with a single Republican defecting.\n\nIn one concession, Republicans backed away from giving the Legislature the power to sidestep the attorney general and appoint their own attorney when state laws are challenged in court.\n\n\u201cThis is a heck of a way to run a railroad,\u201d Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling said as the Senate debate resumed at 5 a.m. after a seven-hour impasse. \u201cThis is embarrassing we\u2019re even here.\u201d\n\nWalker is in his final five weeks as governor. Faced with a Democratic governor for the first time in eight years, Republicans came up with a package of lame-duck bills to preserve their priorities and make it harder for Evers to enact his.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here because you don\u2019t want to give up power,\u201d Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz said as debate concluded in that chamber. \u201cYou\u2019re sore losers. Does anybody think this is the right way to do business? If you vote for this, shame on you. You will go down in history as a disgrace.\u201d\n\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos countered that the bills would ensure a balance of power between the Legislature and the executive branch.\n\n\u201cWe have allowed far too much authority to flow to the executive,\u201d Vos said. \u201cTo you, this is all about politics. To me, it\u2019s about the institution.\u201d\n\nVos last month cited the desire to protect key Republican achievements from being undone by Evers. Among them: a massive $3 billion subsidy to bring Foxconn, a key Apple Inc. supplier, to Wisconsin, along with thousands of jobs. Evers has said he would like to renegotiate the deal.\n\nThe legislation passed Wednesday would shield the state jobs agency from his control and allow the board to choose its leader until September, likely at least delaying Evers\u2019 ability to maneuver on the Foxconn subsidy.\n\nThe changes would also weaken the governor\u2019s ability to put in place rules that enact laws. And they would limit early voting to no more than two weeks before an election, a restriction similar to what a federal judge ruled was unconstitutional .\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office could also be weakened by a proposal to require a legislative committee, rather than the attorney general, to sign off on withdrawing from federal lawsuits. That would stop Evers and Democratic Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul from fulfilling promises to withdraw Wisconsin from a multi-state lawsuit seeking repeal of the Affordable Care Act. They made opposition to that lawsuit a central part of both of their campaigns.\n\nJudges could block the proposals if they become law by issuing temporary injunctions. Democrats would likely need a permanent injunction to stop the changes for good, but Republicans would almost certainly pursue appeals all the way to the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservative justices.\n\nThe Legislature passed another measure to enact Medicaid work requirement rules that Walker recently won a federal waiver to establish. That bill would also give the Legislature oversight over the governor seeking future waivers for health care, a change Democrats said would handcuff the new administration.\n\nRep. Todd Novak of Dodgeville, the only Republican in the Assembly to vote against the bills, said he did so after hearing from \u201can overwhelming number of voters\u201d in his district who opposed the legislation.\n\n\u201cIt is my job,\u201d Novak said, \u201cto cast my vote in the interest of those whom I represent.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "The Wisconsin Senate's Move To Undermine An Incoming Democratic Governor, Explained", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wisconsin-senate-republicans-block-governor-elect_us_5c07f06fe4b0680a7ecb5953", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a number of measures Wednesday to cripple the authority of the state\u2019s incoming Democratic leaders, including Gov.-elect Tony Evers and Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul.\n\nTwo-term Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who narrowly lost his re-election bid last month, is expected to sign the package into law before he leaves office in January.\n\nSo... how did this happen and what does it mean?\n\nEvers, the state schools superintendent, defeated Walker by a razor-thin margin in the midterm election on Nov. 6, securing what appeared to be a major victory for Democrats in the Midwest given the abundance of GOP-controlled governors\u2019 offices and state legislatures in the region.\n\nBut instead of giving Evers a chance to reach across the aisle, Republican lawmakers decided to throw \u201ca tantrum\u201d over Walker\u2019s ouster, as state Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) put it to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last month.\n\nIn an effort to maintain control of the state government, Republican lawmakers pushed through legislation that would kneecap the state\u2019s newly elected Democratic leaders \u2015 essentially undermining the will of the state\u2019s midterm voters. Here are a few ways their proposals would have an effect:\n\nStrip the governor of power to approve major actions by the attorney general\n\nRepublican lawmakers would take control of these decisions under their new bill, which suggests Evers and Kaul would be blocked from withdrawing Wisconsin from a federal lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act \u2015 one of Evers\u2019 campaign promises.\n\nLimit the governor\u2019s control of public benefits programs\n\nUnder one proposal, Evers would have to seek permission from the Wisconsin Legislature before requesting changes to programs run jointly by the state and federal governments.\n\nLimit early voting\n\nThe bill limits early voting to no earlier than two weeks before Election Day in municipalities statewide. In recent years, some communities have offered several weeks of early voting to make it easier for people to get to the polls.\n\nThe measure challenges a 2016 federal court ruling that struck down previous early voter restrictions for \u201cintentionally [discriminating] on the basis of race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWisconsin\u2019s restrictions on the hours for in-person absentee voting have had a disparate effect on African Americans and Latinos,\u201d Judge James Peterson wrote in his decision. \u201cThe intent was to secure partisan advantage.\u201d\n\nSince Latino and African-American voters tend to favor Democratic candidates, the measure now awaiting Walker\u2019s signature is considered likely to benefit Republican candidates.\n\nAt least one law firm has said it will challenge the measure if it is signed into law.\n\nGive Republicans full control of a state economic development agency\n\nWalker created the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in 2011 as a private-public agency that would grant loans to companies looking to grow. Soon, however, the project was littered with mismanagement scandals.\n\nEvers campaigned on reorganizing if not shutting down the ineffective WEDC.

The number of refugees and people fleeing violence or natural disasters has skyrocketed this year, and the topic has become a political hot point through Europe and the United States.\n\nBut these immigrant populations are beneficial to rich nations, the authors found, often traveling for an education or working in roles that contribute to local economies. In Britain, for example, 37 percent of doctors work with medical qualifications they received in another country.\n\n\u201cIn too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda,\u201d Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet, said in a statement. \u201cMigrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health.\u201d\n\nRamon Espinosa/ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump has regularly vilified a migrant caravan attempting to enter the United States, claiming without evidence that the group contains criminals.\n\nAround the world, right-leaning politicians have moved to demonize a growing migrant population, and myths about such people have spread like wildfire. Conservative commentators on Fox News have made false claims that refugees carry \u201cdiseases\u201d that would infect people in the United States. Trump has regularly attacked members of a migrant caravan as criminals, without evidence.\n\n\u201cPopulist discourse demonizes the very same individuals who uphold economies and bolster social care and health services,\u201d Ibrahim Abubakar, the chair of the commission and a professor at University College London, said in a statement. \u201cQuestioning the deservingness of migrants for health care on the basis of inaccurate beliefs supports practices of exclusion, harming the health of individuals, our society, and our economies.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that migrants in rich countries have lower rates of mortality than the nations\u2019 general populations and were less susceptible to a slew of health issues, including cardiovascular disease, mental and behavioral issues and blood disorders. Fertility rates among migrant populations are also lower.\n\nMigrants do have increased rates of HIV, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, but the report found the transmission of such ills to the general population was \u201cnegligible.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michigan Officially Legalizes Marijuana For Recreational Use", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michigan-legalize-marijuana-recreational-use_us_5c07fcb8e4b0bf813ef362ad", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Legal marijuana has officially come to the Midwest.\n\nUnder a new measure taking effect Thursday in Michigan, people ages 21 and older in the state can legally possess and use cannabis for recreational purposes. Michigan voters approved the initiative in November with 56 percent of the vote.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Proposal 1 allows for the possession and transportation of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana \u2015 including up to 15 grams of marijuana concentrate \u2015 and the possession of up to 10 ounces in a nonpublic place. Residents can also grow up to 12 plants at home, though those plants cannot be visible from a public place.\n\nThe new law strictly prohibits the public consumption of cannabis. Driving while under the influence of marijuana also remains illegal.\n\nAlthough the measure calls for state policymakers to begin developing rules and regulations to guide the creation of Michigan\u2019s recreational marijuana industry, officials say retail stores aren\u2019t likely to open until 2020. Proposal 1 also legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp, nonintoxicating strains of cannabis that can be used to make textiles, biofuels and foods.\n\nIn response to November\u2019s vote, incoming Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) has also said she intends to grant clemency to some of the thousands of people locked up in state prison for marijuana-related convictions.\n\nWith the enactment of Proposal 1, Michigan becomes the 10th state in the U.S. \u2015 and the first in the Midwest region \u2015 to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Michigan voters had previously approved medical marijuana in 2008, and it is one of the more than 30 states to have legalized cannabis for that purpose.\n\nMarijuana legalization has spread rapidly across the U.S. since 2012, when Colorado and Washington became the first two states to pass measures okaying recreational cannabis. But up until now, that movement had been limited to states in New England and the West Coast, as well as Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite the shifting legal landscape of marijuana at the state level, the plant is still a Schedule I substance under federal law, alongside drugs like heroin and LSD. But the American public appears to be increasingly skeptical of that longstanding framework. A full two in three Americans now support legalization, and polling has suggested the issue is becoming increasingly bipartisan.\n\nWith Michigan now having joined the ranks of legal marijuana states, it\u2019s only a matter of time before others follow suit, said Matthew Schweich, deputy director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which played a leading role in the organizing support for Proposal 1."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Why I Struggle Memorializing George H.W. Bush As A Liberal Woman With A Disability", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-george-bush-ada-disabilities_us_5c081e43e4b069028dc6060b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Fotosearch via Getty Images In this file photo from 1990, George H.W. Bush signs the Americans With Disabilities Act. The former president died last week at age 94.\n\nI\u2019m a staunch liberal woman who believes strongly and unapologetically in progressive values. I\u2019m also a woman with a disability who has benefited tremendously from the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nThese two identities have left me feeling greatly at odds after the death of former President George H.W. Bush. Is it possible to honor him for this monumental law and also acknowledge he did things during his time in office that seriously harmed people?\n\nWhen Bush signed the ADA into law on July 26, 1990, he said it would \u201censure that people with disabilities are given the basic guarantees for which they have worked so long and so hard: independence, freedom of choice, control of their lives, the opportunity to blend fully and equally into the rich mosaic of the American mainstream.\u201d\n\nI was only 8 years old at the time, but I remember the law being passed and the increased opportunities that followed. Before the ADA was enacted, I couldn\u2019t get into most restaurants, movie theaters and other places of public accommodation. I\u2019ll never forget having to call places before visiting to see if they were wheelchair accessible. For years, the answer was usually \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe ADA both literally and figuratively opened countless doors for people with disabilities. It prohibits employers from discriminating against workers with disabilities and requires they provide reasonable accommodations, such as specialized equipment, sign language interpreters and modified work schedules. The ADA also demands that public and private entities \u2014 such as state and local government agencies, restaurants, hotels, museums and sporting venues \u2014 be fully accessible to those of us with disabilities.\n\nOf course, this landmark law didn\u2019t make ramps and elevators magically appear overnight. Nor did it completely stop discrimination against people with disabilities. Progress takes time, and that can be incredibly frustrating. However, 28 years after Bush signed the ADA into law, I now expect to be able to visit the vast majority of places I want to visit. I expect to not be discriminated against because of my disability. And the ADA did far more than just require places to be accessible. It finally brought disability rights into public consciousness. It acknowledged that we had historically been segregated and isolated from our peers and that discrimination against people with disabilities was a \u201cserious and pervasive social problem.\u201d\n\nPeople with disabilities are a heterogeneous community. We don\u2019t live single-issue lives, and we are affected by politics and policies far beyond just the ones that are disability-specific.\n\nFor Americans with disabilities, the ADA was our Civil Rights Act. And as time has passed, recognition of disability rights has continued to grow. But although Bush was the president to sign the ADA into law, its passage was only possible because of the tireless efforts of disability rights activists across the country. In March 1990, dozens of people with disabilities literally crawled up the stairs of the U.S. Capitol building to demand that Congress finally pass the bill. Today, the disability community\u2019s ability to mobilize continues; most recently, it succeeded in halting the GOP\u2019s repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This community is a force to be reckoned with, and I am proud to be a member of it.\n\nThe ADA continues to change the lives of the 1 in 4 people in the U.S. who have a disability, and Bush deserves to be acknowledged for his part in this. Sure, a later president may have signed it into law, but people with disabilities had already waited long enough \u2015 and in Bush, we found someone who was willing to champion the bill.\n\nThat said, we can\u2019t ignore the countless and egregious errors Bush made during his time in the White House. Several of his policies deleteriously affected the lives of many in our disability community. For example, Bush was and still is rightly criticized for his inaction in addressing the needs of people with HIV and AIDS. He was also known for his racially charged politics that continue to harm people of color today. And Bush completely turned his back on reproductive rights as soon as he perceived it to be politically necessary.\n\nI was too young at the time to understand the significance of these atrocities, but as I grew older and learned more about Bush\u2019s presidency, I found myself increasingly angry. To overlook these errors and the many other intolerable actions Bush took during office would be to erase moments in history we simply can\u2019t afford to forget.\n\nPeople with disabilities are a heterogeneous community. We don\u2019t live single-issue lives, and we are affected by politics and policies far beyond just the ones that are disability-specific. So how do we correctly recognize Bush for his groundbreaking contribution to disability rights and also acknowledge the harms he inflicted on Americans? More importantly, should we?\n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers, nor can I ever fully comprehend the extent to which many of Bush\u2019s policies and positions directly hurt the lives and well-being of many Americans. To claim otherwise would be untrue and dangerous. At the end of the day, all of us with disabilities must decide for ourselves how we want to remember President George H.W. Bush.\n\nMe? I choose to recognize him for passing a law that has positively changed my life and that of so many others. I also acknowledge he was a very flawed leader who hurt a lot of people. The two are not mutually exclusive."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "IVFML Season 2, Episode 7: Is Egg And Sperm Donation 'Worth It'?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivfml-season-2-episode-7-is-egg-and-sperm-donation-worth-it_us_5c06cd22e4b07aec57538cb1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "On this episode of IVFML, we\u2019re going to tell the stories of the people who donate their gametes \u2015 eggs and sperm \u2015 to help other people complete their families.\n\nWe first feature Brian Brown and Sue Andres-Brown, a couple who donated eggs and sperm early on in their marriage. They would both be open to contact from any children that may have resulted from their donation, and welcome the chance to meet them in the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be there to ... be as open and honest about all of that as I can be, but it\u2019s not like I feel like in 13 years or whatever, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll have all my kids back!\u2019\u201d Brown said about the chance to meet any of his donor-conceived children in the future.\n\nWe also feature Katie O\u2019Reilly, a woman who donated her eggs and then was left disappointed by the experience. Despite this, she got in contact with the egg donation agency a few years after the donation to let them know that she had been diagnosed with cancer. She wanted her donor-conceived child to have this new information for his medical history.\n\n\u201cI thought I should write the donation coordinators because in my family health history, I\u2019m the only one in my family who\u2019s had melanoma,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cSo I said this happened, [and] you might want to let this family know about it and have them be really good about sunscreen with their child.\u201d\n\nListen to Episode 7 of \u2018IVFML Becoming Family\u2019 below.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 babies are born in America every year using donated eggs, while an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 babies are born every year using donated sperm. However, these numbers are disputed because there is simply no registry in the U.S. that keeps track of these donor-enabled births.\n\nFor the intended parents, those donations are life-affirming. Egg donations enable infertile women to carry pregnancies, which gives them a biological connection to their child. They also help single men and gay couples pursue gestational surrogacy.\n\nMeanwhile, sperm donations allow single women, lesbian couples or straight couples with a male infertility issue to begin pregnancies with a genetic link to one person in that relationship.\n\nNone of this would be possible without the efforts of the mostly young men and women who donate their gametes. Here\u2019s what the research says about why these donors go through the time and effort of helping others make a family.\n\nA survey of about 1,400 egg donors throughout Europe found that almost half of them \u2015 46 percent \u2015 were motivated purely by the altruism of the donation and wanted to help an infertile family or friend. An additional 32 percent were motivated by both altruism and financial compensation, which ranged throughout those countries from nothing in France to 2,000 Euro, or a little over $2,200, in Belgium, depending on the countries\u2019 regulations.\n\nCompensation for egg donation is regulated varyingly across the EU. In the U.K., for example, compensation for egg donation is capped at 750 pounds, or $956 dollars, while in France, only travel costs can be compensated.\n\nIn the U.S., financial compensation for egg donation is not regulated.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine\u2019s initial guidelines on compensation, published in 2007, said that compensation over $5,000 needed to be justified, and that compensation above $10,000 was \u201cnot appropriate.\u201d\n\nHowever, a class-action lawsuit filed against the organization in 2011 accused the organization of violating federal antitrust laws by artificially capping the compensation donors could get on the open market. A judge ruled in the egg donors\u2019 favor, and as part of the settlement, the ASRM agreed to remove those compensation guidelines that most fertility clinics were following, and refrain from setting similar guidelines in the future.\n\nA 2014 study of 97 Danish sperm donors found that 90 percent were motivated by altruism, although if they stopped receiving money, only 14 percent would continue giving sperm. Most also said they would stop donating if their anonymity could no longer be guaranteed.\n\nThe subject of anonymity and the ways that it influences people to donate \u2014 or not \u2014 in the future is another thorny topic among donors.\n\nAnother 2016 analysis of 62 studies on egg donors\u2019 attitudes about the process found that in general, these women were satisfied with the donation, and a significant proportion were open to being \u201cidentified\u201d donors \u2015 that is, known to the families and children.\n\nMost gamete donations in the U.S. are made anonymously, through agencies that broker relationships between donors and \u201cintended parents\u201d \u2015 people who will buy eggs or sperm based on the donor profiles provided them by the agency.\n\nHowever, experts note that continuing to offer anonymity to donors and intended parents could be unethical. Nowadays, donor-conceived children can find their own genetic relatives via cheap and accessible direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and it would be unethical to pretend otherwise, said Diane Tober, a medical anthropologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, I think we really need to take a close look and see if even offering anonymous donations really makes sense anymore,\u201d Tober said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t promise it, is it ethical to offer it? I think that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\nThe ASRM also pushes for transparency between parent and child. The group strongly encourages parents to disclose how their children were conceived, as it is in their best interests to know about their genetic heritage and medical history. Early disclosure will also protect children from finding out accidentally, or in ways that may inadvertently hurt them.\n\nFor now, there are no laws in the U.S. governing disclosure or anonymity for donors, donor-conceived children or parents. As the U.S. and other countries continue to grapple with changing expectations around gamete donation, individuals are left to figure it out on their own."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Demi Lovato Returns To Instagram With Inspiring Message: 'Never Give Up'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/demi-lovato-returns-to-instagram-never-give-up_us_5c07db3ae4b0680a7ecb1ff3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Demi Lovato looks confident and stronger than ever in a new Instagram message.\n\nThe \u201cSober\u201d singer posted a picture of herself in her jiujitsu robe and blue belt on social media Tuesday, captioning it \u201cSweaty, messy jiu jitsu hair.\u201d\n\nShe added the hashtags \u201cblue belt\u201d and \u201cnever give up\u201d to her photo.\n\nIt\u2019s only the third photo Lovato has posted on the social network since she returned from rehab earlier this year after she was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

While people who are born with both copies of CCR\u2085 disabled are resistant to H.I.V., they are more susceptible to West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis. And there are simpler and safer ways to prevent H.I.V. infection.\n\nMore worrying, Crispr often inadvertently alters genes other than the one being targeted, and there are also circumstances, called mosaicism, where some cells contain the edited gene and others do not. Dr. He claimed in a video that Crispr did not affect other genes in the twins and that the babies were \u201cborn normally and healthy,\u201d but there is no way to know if that is true.\n\nIn fact, some of the data Dr. He presented at a conference in Hong Kong, after he announced the birth of the twins, is concerning, several scientists said. For one thing, it indicates that he was able to disable both copies of the CCR\u2085 gene in only one of the twins, whom Dr. He identified as \u201cNana.\u201d In the other twin, \u201cLulu,\u201d only one copy of CCR\u2085 was disabled, providing limited, if any, protection against H.I.V., but Dr. He implanted the embryo anyway. He said he informed the parents and they wanted both embryos implanted.\n\nSome scientists said the data Dr. He presented also suggested several potential issues resulting from the editing process.\n\nMost importantly, said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania who reviewed the data, \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence of mosaicism\u201d in the edited embryos of both twins. \u201cI was so furious,\u201d Dr. Musunuru said. \u201cThis would have been disturbing anyway \u2014 gene-edited babies. It made it a hundred times worse knowing that he had totally mosaic embryos. It\u2019s as if you took the embryos and dipped them in acid and said \u2018You know what, I\u2019m just going to go ahead with the implantation anyway.\u2019 It\u2019s not that much different.\u201d\n\nWhile it is unclear if the babies themselves ended up with a mosaic patchwork of cells, Dr. Musunuru said the data shows that Lulu\u2019s placenta was mosaic, which is not a good sign.\n\nFinally, it is not known if his study subjects knew what they were agreeing to. The consent they signed was for an AIDS vaccine development project, and it did not mention all the risks of disabling CCR\u2085.

If they are blocked or too narrow, the fetus may not get enough oxygen and nutrients, and the mother\u2019s blood pressure may spike toward pre-eclampsia. This can begin as early as the first trimester, but few tools are available to diagnose it at that stage.\n\n\u201cThe tests that are available today are all designed for the third trimester, and that\u2019s way too late,\u201d said Dr. Alfred Z. Abuhamad, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Va.\n\nIn 2014, the child-health division of the National Institutes of Health set out to find noninvasive methods to identify complications earlier. An infusion of $80 million into placenta research prompted Dr. Abuhamad and others to adapt technologies used in other fields, and has already provided valuable insights into early pregnancy.\n\nSome scientists are betting on magnetic resonance imaging scans, or M.R.I.s, as the most sensitive detectors of placental problems. They are using a method that measures oxygen levels in the blood; it is quick and, so far, seems to catch problems as early as the second trimester. Several teams worldwide are evaluating the technique, each in hundreds of women.\n\nBut M.R.I. is not widely in use in obstetricians\u2019 offices, Dr. Abuhamad said, in contrast with ultrasound machines, which would be a more practical option. Traditional ultrasounds can show the structure and location of the placenta, not how well the organ is functioning. But advances over the past five years have sharpened the machine\u2019s focus. One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue.\n\nDr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.\n\nOther teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems. And one group of researchers is developing an oximeter, a device that quantifies the light reflected back through layers of fat as a measure of blood oxygen."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Personal Health: The Secret to Good Health May Be a Walk in the Park", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/well/move/the-secret-to-good-health-may-be-a-walk-in-the-park.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Even though I was heading to a highly coveted job at The New York Times in 1965, I was heartbroken to leave Minneapolis, where I had begun my journalistic career two years earlier.\n\nMinneapolis was then, and still is, a slice of heaven for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors. According to an ambitious project of the Trust for Public Land, Minneapolis leads the nation\u2019s metropolitan areas in providing the best overall access for the most people to well-equipped and serviced public parks and recreation.

New York City, with 99 percent of residents enjoying easy access to a park, playground, trail or other open area, ranks ninth overall in terms of public outdoor access when park size and other factors are considered."}]
