He has not directly contradicted Trump's fervent denials of collusion between his campaign and Moscow.\n\nFurthermore, it is not known whether Mueller has documentary evidence to implicate the President in any wrongdoing, or is simply relying on Cohen's testimony. Many legal experts doubt he would wager on a witness like Cohen, who has admitted lying, without supporting evidence.\n\nBut there is no clear indication that Trump broke the law. And, despite Thursday's developments, there is no sign that a political situation in Washington that still makes impeachment an unlikely prospect has changed.\n\nTrump, just after landing in Buenos Aires for the G20, showed that the investigation was still on his mind despite the upcoming conference.\n\n\"This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately,\" the President tweeted late Thursday.\n\nBut Thursday's developments must also be seen in the context of Mueller's work so far.\n\nIn a series of indictments, he has built a picture of a sophisticated Russian hacking operation, an attempt to infect America's political dialogue with lies and distraction on social media and indicted and convicted a number of Trump associates and advisers over lying to his investigation.\n\nHe may now be trying to establish that Trump and those around him were well aware of Russia's activity despite their vehement claims there was no collusion.\n\nSome observers believe that the rich detail in Mueller's legal filings is one way of painting a picture of Russian interference and the behavior of Trump world in case the President finds some way to block his eventual final report.\n\nThere are immediate and longer term political and legal consequences from Cohen throwing himself firmly in Mueller's camp.\n\nHis claims, made under oath and with the certainty of a long jail sentence if he is being untruthful, directly contradict Trump's assurances that he has had no deals or business relationships with Russia.\n\nIf that is the case, Trump has brazenly lied to the American people.\n\nIn another damaging blow, Cohen said he lied for political reasons.\n\n\"I made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1's political messaging and to be loyal to Individual-1,\" Cohen said in a document filed with the court, referring to the President.\n\nHis statement raises another question not answered in the document.\n\nDid the President know that Cohen was lying to Congress, or did he coerce him to do so? If he did, such a move would surely rise to the level of the kind of abuse of power that would be part of any articles of impeachment.\n\nThe President slammed Cohen as \"weak\" on Thursday and said he was lying to Mueller to spare himself a long jail sentence after admitting to tax and financial fraud. He made the remarks to reporters before heading off to the G20 summit in Argentina, in an unsolicited statement that appeared to show his unease.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani also blasted Cohen.\n\nAnd he tried to scotch a question that buzzed around Washington immediately after the Cohen news: Did Trump tell a different story about his hopes of building a Trump tower in Moscow in written answers to the special counsel than what Cohen has testified, a version of events Mueller clearly believes?\n\nGiuliani said that there was \"no contradiction\" between Trump's responses to Mueller and Cohen. And he suggested that by waiting to move on Cohen until the President turned over his answers to his questions in recent days, he might have been setting a trap.\n\n\"Their sneakiness didn't work if that's what they were trying to do,\" Giuliani said.\n\nTrump's defense may have backfired\n\nYet Trump's own self-defense raised another question that could weaken his position and cause trouble for his legal team.\n\nHe said that he was justified in seeking business opportunities in Russia while running for President because he might not have reached the White House and should not therefore be penalized by losing a chance to make money.\n\n\"There would be nothing wrong if I did do it. I was running my business while I was campaigning,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would have gone back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\"\n\nTrump's comment left the impression he was using his platform as a presidential candidate as a vehicle to enrich himself rather than to serve the American people.\n\nMore troublingly, the possibility that he could be seeking favorable treatment from Russia could offer a motivation for a change made to water down a hostile stance towards Russian in the platform at the Republican National Convention.\n\nAnd the fact that he lied about not having business links with Russia after pursuing the deal offered Moscow leverage over him when he became President, opening the possibility of a serious national security threat if he was viewed as compromised.\n\nTrump might have also undermined a possible avenue of defense, that Cohen was the primary actor in the search for a Trump Tower Moscow deal, when he said: \"I decided not to do the project, so I didn't do it. \"\n\nSome Trump supporters warned against irresponsibly jumping to conclusions and questioned Cohen's credibility.\n\n\"The sky is falling all of a sudden because there is another plea deal. Who knows how this is going to play out in terms of the credibility of Michael Cohen,\" said Jim Schultz, a former Trump White House lawyer on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\nThe White House was braced for some kind of Cohen bombshell ever since he appeared in Washington to meet Mueller's prosecutors earlier this month.\n\nWhat must most worry them now, and other people close to Trump who could be implicated by the Russia organization, is what he has said in consultations that have now stretched over three full days."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Toobin: I think Trump may not finish term", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/fQYPLePU3dU/trump-michael-cohen-moscow-toobin-finish-term-ac360-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Individual-1 was identified in court filings as Trump, and Cohen identified him as such in a New York courtroom Thursday.\n\nCohen, who famously once declared he would \"take a bullet\" for Trump, is cooperating with Mueller and has spoken with the special counsel's office for more than 70 hours on topics beyond Moscow, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.\n\nHe pleaded guilty earlier this year to eight counts in a separate case from the Manhattan US attorney's office. Cohen did not have an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors on that case.\n\nThursday's revelations are potentially significant because they appear to show that Trump was engaged in business dealings with Russia in the midst of a campaign in which Moscow interfered to help elect him.\n\nThey could also intersect with other information that Mueller knows to create political and legal jeopardy for the President.\n\nTrump responded to Cohen's admission at the White House on Thursday, calling his former lawyer \"very weak.\"\n\n\"He's a weak person,\" Trump said before departing for Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n\"He was convicted with a fairly long-term sentence with things unrelated to the Trump Organization,\" Trump said. \"What he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence.\"\n\nIn fact, Cohen hasn't been sentenced in either case, and the charges to which he pleaded guilty in August included information about his reimbursement by the Trump Organization for payments he made or helped orchestrate to conceal allegations from two women about sexual encounters with Trump before he ran for office. Trump has denied those claims.\n\nThe Justice Department notified Trump's legal team on Wednesday night about Cohen's planned plea, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, although it is unclear when the President himself was informed.\n\nCohen was also charged in the Manhattan US attorney's office case with tax fraud and false statements to a bank. He is scheduled to be sentenced in both cases on December 12.\n\nCohen left the courthouse Thursday without making a statement.\n\nJUST WATCHED Schiff: If Cohen misled, Trump misled country Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schiff: If Cohen misled, Trump misled country 01:18\n\nCooperating with Mueller\n\nCohen's cooperation with Mueller has included meetings with federal prosecutors on at least seven occasions beginning August 7, 2018, two weeks before he was first charged in New York, according to court filings.\n\nCohen had previously said talks about the Moscow project had ended in January 2016.\n\nIn a letter to Congress and in congressional testimony, Cohen had also stated that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project, and that he hadn't considered asking Trump to travel for the project. He had also said he didn't recall speaking to the Russian government about the project.\n\nAll of those statements were false, Cohen said Thursday.\n\n\"In truth and in fact, and as Cohen well knew, Cohen's representations about the Moscow Project he made to (House and Senate Intelligence committees) were false and misleading,\" Mueller's office said in a court filing.\n\n\"Cohen made the false statements to (1) minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1 and (2) give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and . . . the very first primary,' in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations,\" prosecutors said in court filings.\n\nDiscussions with 'Individual-2' on Moscow project\n\nThe charges provide a much fuller picture of the Trump Organization's efforts to advance the project in Moscow.\n\nAs late as June 2016, according to prosecutors, Cohen and another man, identified in filings as \"Individual-2,\" discussed efforts to gain Russian government approval for the Moscow project. Individual-2 is Felix Sater, a Russian-born onetime business associate of Trump's, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCohen discussed the project with Trump on more than the three occasions he had previously mentioned, prosecutors said, and he briefed Trump family members working within the Trump Organization about the efforts. Cohen also agreed to travel to Russia and asked Trump about the possibility of Trump going there in service of the project. In addition, Cohen \"asked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nIn May 2016, after Sater asked Cohen when the trip involving Trump should occur, Cohen responded that Trump's trip should take place \"once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\" Sater and Cohen communicated extensively about plans for Cohen's own prospective trip, filings show, but in June 2016, Cohen told Sater he wouldn't go. In court Thursday, Cohen added: \"I would like to note that I did not in fact travel there, nor have I ever been to Russia.\"\n\nAfter Cohen outlined his lies concerning the extent of his discussion with Trump and his plans for travel to Russia, a special counsel prosecutor, L. Rush Atkinson, told US District Judge Andrew Carter that Cohen had neglected to admit to a third set of falsehoods -- those concerning his direct contact with the Russian government about the Moscow project.\n\nCohen had had a 20-minute phone call with a representative of the Kremlin in January 2016, according to filings. Atkinson was joined in court Thursday by special counsel prosecutors Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Goldstein.\n\nThe charge to which Cohen pleaded Thursday carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000 and supervised release of no more than three years.\n\nDemocrats vow to investigate\n\nHouse Democrats, who will retake the majority early next year, plan to use their new power to investigate the disclosures revealed in the new set of charges against Cohen.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman, said his panel will try to bring in Cohen and investigate whether there was any money laundering by the Russians through the Trump Organization.\n\n\"If Mr. Cohen misled the Congress about the President's business dealings in Russia deep into the campaign, it also means that the President misled the country about his business dealings, and that the Russians were apparently attempting to gain financial leverage over the potential President of the United States,\" Schiff told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\n\nStatus of Mueller investigation\n\nTrump has criticized the Mueller probe and his own Justice Department almost daily, fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month and has hinted at a pardon for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nBut Cohen is the latest former Trump associate to say he lied -- apparently to protect the President -- a circle of defense that now seems to be quickly unraveling.\n\nThe news comes a few weeks after the President installed a skeptic of the Russia probe, Matt Whitaker, as his acting attorney general. The move was seen by some critics as an attempt to disrupt Mueller and to stop him from making new indictments.\n\nThe latest charges also cross what Trump has set as a red line -- an investigation into his family's business empire -- that the President has warned would cause him to fire the special counsel.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Org. in spotlight after Cohen plea", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GwXYVFJZYt0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Michael Cohen's admission that he lied to Congress about Donald Trump's knowledge of the ongoing effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign has ensnared the President's children in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nAfter previously saying that the Moscow project had stopped in January 2016, just before the Iowa caucuses, Cohen said Thursday in federal court that discussions actually continued until June 2016 -- when Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nCohen, in accepting a plea deal, admitted that he had \"more extensive communications\" than the three he previously indicated he had with Trump, which he previously claimed lasted no more than a few minutes, and added that he \"briefed\" Trump family members about the project. The guilty plea doesn't state which family members Cohen is referring to or when he spoke with them. It would not be illegal to discuss the plans with Trump's children, who were helping steer the business.\n\nAt least one of Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., a loyal surrogate for his father on the campaign trail, has provided testimony under oath to at least three congressional committees where he was asked about the proposed deal. Most of that testimony is not public and it isn't clear how detailed the questions were about the project. Yet it could place him in legal jeopardy if anything he told Congress conflicts with information provided by Cohen if it is supported by other evidence.\n\nA person close to the company tells CNN that Trump Jr. did know about the project as did his sister, Ivanka, whose involvement was limited to recommending architects and designers. The source says Trump Jr.'s testimony that his knowledge was \"peripheral\" is \"100% accurate.\"\n\nThe source added that the Trump Organization found one email involving Trump Jr. and a few that included Ivanka, but said all of those communications were sent before January 2016.\n\nOne House panel said in a footnote to a report that Trump Jr. told them he believed the Moscow project was dormant as of early June 2016. But it was not clear the context of what Trump Jr. was asked or exactly how he answered it.\n\n\"All communications, all document that we have [about] Trump Moscow end by January 2016,\" the source said. The person added, if Cohen continued to work on the project into 2016 \"we weren't aware of it.\"\n\nIt is not clear if Trump Jr. has testified before the special counsel and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nTrump Jr. is already under the spotlight because of his role in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that he agreed to take after being told a Russian lawyer had incriminating information on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe President has previously said an investigation into the Trump Organization, his family's closely-held business, would be a red line for him in terms of his tolerance for the special counsel probe.\n\nFollowing the guilty plea Thursday, Trump called Cohen a liar, saying on the South Lawn of the White House. \" Michael Cohen is lying and he's trying to get a reduced sentence for things that have nothing to do with me,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President defended the deal for a possible Trump real estate venture in Moscow. The project, Trump said, \"lasted a short period of time,\" adding that he decided not to do it because he wanted to focus on running for president. In Cohen's now-discredited testimony, he told lawmakers that he made the decision to terminate the deal on his own without consulting with Trump or any members of the Trump family.\n\nHowever, the President maintained Thursday that \"there would've been nothing wrong if I did do it.\"\n\nThe overlap of Trump's business ties and his political ambitions has been a knotty issue for him since the campaign. He only handed the reins of his business over to his two sons and chief financial officer on the eve of his inauguration, keeping his hand on the steering wheels during the campaign.\n\nTrump kept a firm grip on the business before he took the oath of office in 2017, with key decisions about projects belonging to him and his children Trump Jr, and Ivanka Trump. They were more intimately involved in real estate projects than their younger brother, Eric Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump was often at her father's side and visited projects. She posted a photo of her at a construction site for a project in Azerbaijan on Instagram while both Trump Jr. and his sister attended ribbon cutting ceremonies at project announcements and openings around the globe, from Trump Soho in New York to condo-hotel projects in Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Organization and Trump Jr., did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Ivanka Trump declined to comment.\n\nDiscussions over the Trump Tower Moscow project began in 2015 and by October 28, Trump had signed preliminary agreement that would have brought $4 million in fees to his business to work with a Russian to develop a luxury hotel.\n\nAccording to documents provided to CNN, the project under discussion would have named the hotel spa named after Ivanka Trump. Trump's company was explicitly given the option to \"brand any or all portion of the spa or fitness facilities as 'The Spa by Ivanka Trump' or similar brand,\" according to the document. And if they did name it after Trump's daughter, then Ivanka or her designee would be given \"sole and absolute discretion\" to approve \"all interior design elements of the spa or fitness facilities,\" the document says.\n\nThe deal never came to fruition.\n\nThe only one of Trump's children who has testified under oath about the Trump Tower Moscow effort in 2015 and 2016 is Trump Jr., who was questioned by several congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in the election.\n\nTrump Jr was asked by the House Judiciary Committee if he had any involvement in the potential deal. He responded, under oath, \"Like I said, I was peripherally aware of it, but most of my knowledge has been gained since as it relates to hearing about it over the last few weeks,\" according to a transcript of the interview, which occurred in September 2017, shortly after Cohen publicly revealed details about the Trump Tower Moscow proposal.\n\nHe also testified before the Senate and House Intelligence committees. The House Intelligence panel report released by the Republicans references Trump Jr.'s testimony about the Moscow deal. The report says in a footnote, \"Trump Jr. testified that, as of early June 2016, he believed the Trump Tower Moscow project was dormant.\"\n\nBy contrast, Cohen says he lied when he told lawmakers the deal talks ended in January. The House report does not provide direct quotes from Trump Jr.'s testimony. The Senate has not released any information about Trump Jr.'s testimony.\n\nCohen's guilty plea does not indicate when he briefed the family members about his dealings to get the project off the ground. The source close to the Trump Organization said, \"Michael's modus operandi is to work independently. He doesn't have a great history in including people in the discussion. And on this project, everything that we've seen and all the prep we've done of Don (Jr.) indicates he really knew nothing about this project.\"\n\nAccording to court papers filed Thursday, Cohen spoke with the assistant to Putin's spokesman in January about moving the project forward and possible financing. He also discussed traveling to Moscow in early May 2016 adding that Trump could travel \"once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\"\n\nCohen spoke again in June with a person identified as \"Individual 2\" in Thursday's court filings but known to be Felix Sater, a Russian-American business partner who was involved in other Trump Organization projects in Florida and New York.\n\nBetween June 9 and June 14, 2016, the court papers allege, Sater sent multiple messages to Cohen about traveling, including forms for Cohen to fill out.\n\nCohen met with Sater in the lobby of Trump Tower on June 14, 2016, to tell Sater he wouldn't be traveling.\n\nSater has shared documents with the special counsel's office. He has been a government informant for years stemming from his role in a stock manipulation scheme from the late 1990s. Sater's attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump Tower meeting on Clinton\n\nThe Moscow project overlaps with another critical meeting that is of interest to the special counsel's investigation.\n\nOn June 3, a publicist for a Russian pop star reached out to Trump Jr. to arrange a meeting with a Russian lawyer promising incriminating information on presidential rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeveral phone calls, including one to a blocked phone number, followed.\n\nTrump Jr. had several brief phone calls with Emin Agalarov, the son of a Russian real estate magnate, who requested the meeting. Trump Jr. told lawmakers he didn't recall speaking with Emin ahead of the June 9 meeting.\n\nNestled between those calls was one made to a blocked number. Lawmakers have openly suggested Trump Jr. may have called his father on that line. During its investigation, the House Intelligence Committee heard testimony that Trump's primary residence has a blocked phone line.\n\nTrump Jr. told lawmakers \"I have no idea\" who the blocked call was with. When asked if he told his father about the meeting or the underlying offer he said, \"No, I did not.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Jake Tapper: Mueller crossing Trump's red line", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/9FE52AiSpBI/jake-tapper-mueller-trump-red-line-lead-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "The latest charges in the Mueller probe cross what Trump has set as a red line -- an investigation into his family's business empire.

The new statistics coincided with the announcement of a 5 million euro government fund to combat anti-Semitism in schools and a pledge to tackle online hate speech.\n\nFrederic Potier, the man charged with leading the government's plans to tackle anti-Semitism, said the poll's findings were shocking.\n\n\"I'm really surprised by this number because in our country... 20% is a lot,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN as to why the number was so high, he answered: \"I will not say that we don't have any problems, yes we do.

With regards to anti-Semitism in France, the Dreyfus affair is on the curriculum in middle school (13-14) and in high school (16-17), this allows us to delve into the issue of anti-Semitism in France and in Europe. The Holocaust constitutes a large part of the program in secondary school.\"\n\n\"On the whole, I think the Holocaust is well taught in the curriculum and it's wrong to say it's difficult to teach the Holocaust in French schools, particularly in the suburbs,\" Reverchon told CNN.\n\n\"I taught in three different schools, all three were difficult and in the suburbs, but I never had any difficulty teaching the Holocaust, my students were always receptive. If there are examples, and I'm not denying their existence, they are globally isolated events.\"\n\nViolent attacks\n\nSince 2006, when Ilan Halimi, a young Jewish man, was kidnapped and killed, 11 people have died in anti-Semitic attacks in France.\n\nIn 2017, Sarah Halimi, a 65-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman, was murdered in her apartment, dragged from her bed and thrown from the balcony in an anti-Semitic attack which shocked the nation.\n\nEarlier this year, hundreds took to the streets to protest after Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old French Holocaust survivor, was slain in her apartment in what French authorities have described as an anti-Semitic hate crime.\n\nAn undated photograph of Mireille Knoll (R), provided to CNN by her granddaughter Jessica Knoll (L).\n\nThat list of fatal attacks almost included Nathaniel Azoulay, an 18-year-old Parisian who told CNN how he was attacked by a man wielding a saw after a traffic altercation. Azoulay says the man had been civil toward him initially.\n\n\"He was talking to me normally, but at some point, his speech changed when he saw the kippah,\" said Azoulay, referring to his head covering.\n\nThe man's aggression prompted Azoulay and his brother to flee their car, running as fast as they could toward safety. Though both trained in Krav Maga, the self-defense system used by the Israel Defense Forces and taught in Jewish community centers in France, neither could escape the assailant.\n\n\"He started hurling anti-Semitic insults, 'f***king Jew, you're gonna die on this road,'\" said Azoulay. \"He wanted us to die... he stabbed my brother with the saw and my brother could not protect himself with his Krav Maga moves.\"\n\nAzoulay says he tried to save his brother, who had been pushed to the floor with the saw aimed at his neck, but a group of the attacker's friends arrived and surrounded the siblings.\n\n\"The attacker was shouting: 'They're f***ing Jews we can beat up, come, hit them,'\" said Azoulay.\n\n\"We tried to run back to the car. He attacked me again with the saw on my back but I had a big jacket. His friends were going towards my brother and pushing him on the ground. I managed to grab the saw. I grabbed the sharp side so it cut my fingers and I had to get it stitched up at the hospital.\"\n\nAzoulay says the attack came to a halt only after the father of the attacker pleaded with his son to stop.\n\nAzoulay's brother was injured in the attack and police investigated. But a trial has yet to begin.\n\nThe relationship between the two communities has deteriorated steadily as the politics of the Middle East has reverberated in France.\n\nIt's visible in the working-class Parisian suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, which once had a thriving Jewish community.\n\nThe community center and synagogue were once full.

They are afraid for their children and that's crazy.\"\n\nThe turning point\n\nYonathan Arfi, vice president of CRIF, an umbrella body for Jewish groups in France, says there have been \"several hundred attacks\" since 2000, with the nature of those attacks changing markedly.\n\nHe cites the start of the second intifada in the West Bank and Gaza in 2000 as the moment the attacks on the Jewish community began to change.\n\n\"Before it was graffiti on buildings, now it ends up with (the) killing of people and terrorism, so we see that the nature of anti-Semitism has changed dramatically,\" said Arfi.\n\n\"These attacks were committed by young people identifying with Palestinians considering Jews guilty of the things happening in the Middle East, I would say.\"\n\nWhile traditional anti-Semitism is not a new phenomenon in France, the government is battling against what has been coined as the \"new anti-Semitism,\" which it says spills out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nPotier says there is a divergence between both the \"old\" and \"new\" strains of anti-Semitism, which are equally destructive.\n\n\"What we call in France the new anti-Semitism is coming from radical Muslims, but as I say every day, the new anti-Semitism uses very old messages like the Protocol of the Elders of Zion, the theory that Jews have money and power,\" Potier said. \"... both are completely linked. There is a common point between the far-right and radical Muslims.\n\n\"When you are talking about Jews and money for instance, it is the same clich\u00e9, it is the same stereotypes that are being used by these groups. So, when you are educating people, about religious beliefs, what is Israel, what is Zionism, you are using the same tools.\"\n\nHakim El Karoui, a senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne who has previously worked for the French Ministry for Economy and Finance and has advised the government on anti-Semitism, says the lack of familiarity between the two communities is a huge factor in creating tension.\n\nIncreasing segregation between the communities is a dangerous reality that is leading to even less interaction and understanding between communities, often prompting more tension, he says.\n\n\"What has happened in a lot of working-class neighborhoods is that where Arab and Jews once lived together, the Jews have left,\" El Karoui told CNN.\n\n\"They (the Jewish community) left Seine-Saint-Denis, they went to the west side of Paris and therefore they don't know each other anymore,\" El Karoui said.\n\n\"I'm pretty worried about the deterioration of the situation and I think the best answer to this issue should obviously be coming from the government but also from the Muslim community.\n\n\"It needs to say out loud: 'You have no right to say this.' It needs to say, 'You are wrong. You are making a mistake by saying this because in the end your words will come back against you.' The fact that there's a lot of silence on this topic is a problem.\"\n\nThe government hopes its new plan can begin to tackle the roots of anti-Semitism within France.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the mobilization of a national team tasked with educating children in schools across the country on the dangers of anti-Semitism.\n\nHe also promised to make tackling online hate speech a national priority, as well as introducing an anti-racism prize named after Halimi, a 23-year-old tortured and murdered in an anti-Semitic attack in 2006. There are also plans for an online complaint procedure to allow users to register attacks with authorities.\n\nMyriam's family sit down together for Shabbat dinner in a Parisian suburb.\n\nBut For Myriam and her family, the question of whether her son can live safely in the country of his birth remains a difficult one.\n\nThe violence toward France's Jewish community scares her, and while she says the government has tried to act, she is clear that more needs to be done.\n\n\"For over 10 years, the government makes efforts, for sure, in terms of legislation and policies, but it's not enough,\" she says.\n\n\"The first priority is to recognize that the problem, the heart of the problem, it's the radical Islam. First, name the problem. And then, it's more education.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Trump's whirlwind G20 set to begin after he cancels Putin meeting", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/87t9tql0cZA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Buenos Aires (CNN) President Donald Trump was only a half-hour into his nine-hour flight to the G20 summit here in the Argentine capital when he decided to pull the plug on the most hotly anticipated moment of his trip: a lengthy face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut while Trump's abrupt decision quashed concerns that the President would repeat his cozy performance alongside Putin during their last meeting in Helsinki, Finland, new allegations by the President's former longtime attorney Michael Cohen revived questions about Trump's financial ties to Russia as he arrived for the international summit.\n\nTrump's planned meetings with a half-dozen other world leaders -- combined with the possibility of diplomatic snafus -- offer little promise of clearing the smoke of suspicion that is once again following him abroad.\n\nTrump arrived in Buenos Aires for the summit late Thursday night, marking the first time he has set foot in Latin America in his nearly two years in office and kicking off what promises to be a whirlwind 48-hour visit . Friday will amount to the President's busiest day of diplomacy, but his most important meeting of the summit -- his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- doesn't come until a day later.\n\nTrump's aides hoped a signing ceremony for the recently struck United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would act as a centerpiece of the trip, and they scheduled an event for Friday morning. Persistent disputes with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- including over US steel and aluminum tariffs -- led to questions about who precisely from the Canadian side would be doing the signing. But on Thursday evening, an official with the Canadian Prime Minister said Trudeau would be at Friday's ceremony.\n\nTrump has hailed the agreement as evidence of his negotiating prowess and said the pact would benefit American workers. He's been unnerved in recent days by a shaky stock market and factory closures by General Motors, according to people familiar with the matter, and is hoping to be able to tout the new trade agreement in Argentina.\n\nAggressive schedule\n\nTrump will dart from bilateral meetings to summit sessions and back, starting with an early morning breakfast alongside Argentine President Mauricio Macri, the summit's host. Trump has known Macri for decades, beginning when both were real estate developers.\n\nThat session will lead into the large gathering of the G20, where Trump will find himself face-to-face with the collection of global leaders he has sometimes rebuffed. It's in these sessions that he's most likely to run across Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who most of the world has castigated after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nTrump has taken the opposite approach, indicating he has no plans to cut ties to Saudi Arabia. And while he couldn't fit in a formal meeting with the crown prince in Buenos Aires, he indicated before he departed the US on Thursday that he would like to speak to the young leader.\n\nA pull-aside chat is scheduled with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, whose government has pushed for greater punishment of Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's killing, which occurred at a consulate in Istanbul. Trump is also slated to speak on the sidelines with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has acted as an avid cheerleader for Trump's diplomatic opening with North Korea.\n\nLess enthusiastic has been Japanese President Shinzo Abe, who's expressed concern about easing pressure on Pyongyang without any corresponding steps from the North Korean regime. Trump will have a more formal meeting with Abe in the afternoon, where they'll be joined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nFinally, Trump will sit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted last year's G20 and has withstood sustained attacks by Trump over auto imports and trade. Merkel recently announced that she will not run for another term as chancellor after acting as Europe's de facto leader for more than a decade.\n\nMueller cloud remains\n\nJUST WATCHED Does Cohen plea reveal legal exposure for Trump children?

MUST WATCH Does Cohen plea reveal legal exposure for Trump children? 07:17\n\nHanging over it all will be the questions sparked by the latest twist in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation -- just the latest instance of the Mueller investigation following Trump outside the United States.\n\nThe President's international trips have been repeatedly marred by developments in the investigation, beginning with Mueller's appointment as special counsel just two days before Trump left for his first international trip. The President has publicly and privately groused that he thinks the investigation has hampered his diplomatic efforts on the world stage.\n\nTrump's second foreign trip, in July 2017, became another key moment in the Mueller investigation as the President and his aides worked to craft a statement on behalf of his eldest son concerning the now-infamous meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower a year prior. A year later, as the President prepared to fly to Helsinki to meet with Putin, the Justice Department announced the indictment of Russian intelligence officers linked to election interference.\n\nThe Cohen plea agreement on Thursday became the latest example, and soon after the news emerged Trump moved to scrap his meeting with Putin. The White House said Trump had decided to cancel the get-together following a meeting with his top foreign policy advisers after boarding Air Force One, even though no new information had publicly emerged.\n\nScrapping the meeting with Putin, though, did not eliminate all of the President's flair for make-or-break drama. He is still scheduled to join Xi, the Chinese President, for a working dinner on Saturday to hash out a possible ceasefire to the trade war that has roiled their countries and threatens to wreak havoc on the global economy if the ratcheting-up persists.\n\nLeaving the White House on Thursday, Trump kept the global suspense going.\n\n\"I think we're very close to doing something with China, but I don't know that I want to do it, because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes. So I really don't know,\" the President said before departing Washington. \"But I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I'm open to making a deal.

A Japanese defense white paper in August highlighted concerns over Asia's changing security environment.\n\n\"China's rapid modernization of the People's Liberation Army, enhancement of operational capabilities, and unilateral escalation of activities in areas close to Japan are generating strong security concerns in the region and international community, including Japan,\" the paper said.\n\nF-35 fighter aircraft from the Japan Air Self-Defense Force take part in a military review at the Ground Self-Defence Force's Asaka training ground in Asaka, Saitama prefecture on October 14, 2018.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Timothy Heath, senior defense analyst for the RAND Corp, said that China's ambition to dominate the Asia-Pacific region carries \"enormous consequences for Japan.\"\n\n\"It is in Japan's interest to build a capable military that deters China from rash actions and to help other countries balance politically and military against Chinese power,\" said Heath.\n\nJUST WATCHED China touts fighter jets at public airshow Replay More Videos ...

When you see great focus on the F-35 from Japan I think that is the result of the very strong US-Japan military partnership,\" the source told CNN.\n\n'Push the front line of maritime engagement'\n\nSources said the new Japanese-US deal would include two of the three F-35 variants, the A and B models. The third, the F-35C, is designed for use on the US Navy's largest aircraft carriers.\n\nF-35As, of which Japan already has 10 in its fleet, with 32 more on an preexisting order, are conventional jets, using a runway to take off and land.\n\nF-35Bs are short take-off and vertical landing capable, meaning they can use smaller airports or operate from flattop warships. The US Marine Corps flies F-35Bs off US Navy amphibious assault ships, sometimes called baby aircraft carriers as they are about half the size of the US Navy's Nimitz-class carriers.\n\nJapan's Maritime Self Defense Force possesses two of these type of ships, the Izumo and its sister ship, the Kaga, each one is capable of carrying 14 helicopters and would need to be refitted to accommodate the F-35Bs aircraft.\n\nThe Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ship JS Izumo sails the South China Sea with the US guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey.\n\nWhile the main role of Japan's military remains defense of its home islands, \"this could push the front line of maritime engagement further out than before,\" said Corey Wallace, Asia security analyst at Freie University in Berlin, said of Japan's possible acquisition of F-35Bs.\n\n\"Will it bother China? Probably, but only in so far that it further complicates the projection of Chinese military power into the southwestern maritime domain around Japan's Ryukyu islands,\" Wallace said.\n\nAn article published in the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper, Wednesday, said the refit of the Izumo-class ships, and the purchase of the F-35Bs, \"essentially changes the warships' nature from a defensive to offensive one.\"\n\nThe story continued: \"Japan must not forget its infamous history of invading countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region during WWII.\"\n\nChina's own answer to the F-35, the domestically built twin-engine J-20 stealth jet, entered the People's Liberation Army Air Force fleet in February. It is unknown how many J-20's China has in operation in its fleet at present.\n\nCarl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and now Hawaii Pacific University professor, said the F-35Bs on a Japanese warship \"add a new dimension\" and \"a deterrent factor\" to the security situation in the Pacific.\n\nBut Schuster said a refitted Japanese carrier would likely only carry six to eight F-35Bs, compared to as many as two dozen jets that will be on Chinese carriers now in sea trials or production.\n\nSchuster also cautions that it could be three or four years until newly ordered F-35s reach the Japanese fleet, unless Tokyo's orders are given priority over other buyers of the plane.\n\nThe Japanese Air Self-Defense Force maintainers pose for a photo during the arrival of the first Japanese F-35A at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nTwelve nations besides Japan and the US are in the F-35 program, with two of those -- Australia and South Korea -- in the Pacific region, according to Lockheed Martin, which builds the plane.\n\nJapan does enjoy the advantage of being one of three final assembly points for the F-35, the others being in Texas and Italy.\n\nAnd it's the F-35 commonality between Japan, the US and their allies that brings strength in numbers but also understanding.\n\nWallace said the future could conceivably have US F-35s operating from Japanese ships and or Japanese F-35s flying off American ones.\n\nOne of the other two nations to operate the F-35B, the United Kingdom, has had US versions of the jet operating off its HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier.\n\nBut Wallace also warned not to overemphasize the importance of a Japanese carrier.\n\n\"This singular new carrier won't carry enough planes, or be able to launch jets with enough ordnance to conduct strike, or bombing missions in any way that will truly threaten China's mainland, given how strong China's own defenses are,\" he said.\n\nWhat F-35Bs will do is increase the options available to Japanese defense planners.\n\n\"The F-35B can operate from modified runways or make-shift airfields thereby giving Japan's Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) more options to operate from smaller, more distant Japanese islands in a pinch. This is quite important for survivability and response if the major airbases are put out of commission in a saturation missile attack,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Congo Ebola outbreak is 2nd largest, 2nd deadliest", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/VRum2yJvd38/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- with 426 total cases, including 245 deaths -- is now the second largest and second deadliest in history, according to Thursday's report from the nation's Ministry of Health.\n\nA 2000-01 outbreak in Uganda included 425 cases and caused 224 deaths, according to the World Health Organization . The deadliest outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.\n\n\"This is a milestone nobody wanted to hit,\" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic wrote in an email. On average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but case fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August, has a case fatality rate of 57%.\n\nOf the total cases, 379 have been confirmed, and 47 are probable, according to the ministry. An additional 87 suspected cases are under investigation.\n\nOn a positive note, 126 patients have recovered, the ministry said.\n\nThis is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the second this year.\n\nneighboring Ituri province, according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. North Kivu province , which includes the cities Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported inneighboring Ituri province, according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\n\"The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high,\" WHO said in a statement Thursday\n\nHowever, there have been no confirmed cases in Congo's neighbors, Jasarevic said. \"All neighboring countries have implemented heightened surveillance and are detecting and investigating alerts and suspected Ebola cases.\"\n\nCases continue to mushroom\n\nRecent spread of the infection to people in Butembo, a city that's home to 1.2 million, \"raised concerns,\" wrote Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, and his co-authors in an editorial published online Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSeeing \"gaps in the response,\" Gostin and his co-authors recommend that the United States and allies \"mobilize high-level political attention and resources for the Ebola response\" and \"develop a plan to deploy public health personnel to North Kivu.\"\n\nIn October, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel who had been stationed in Congo had been pulled back from the worst affected areas due to safety concerns, a US government official familiar with the situation said at the time\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\nA senior White House official confirmed this month that US government personnel who had been working on the ground in Beni had been evacuated to other parts of Congo due to safety concerns. The official said that the situation is being evaluated constantly and that in the meantime, the US continues to provide technical and financial assistance to contain the outbreak.\n\nJasarevic described the overall environment as \"complex and challenging.\"\n\n\"On Friday, 16 November, a second attack in one week occurred in Beni,\" he reported. \"UN peacekeepers and government forces engaged with rebel forces. By Sunday, November 18 all activities in Beni were re-launched, including vaccination.\"\n\nJasarevic says the response in areas outside Beni has not been affected by conflict, but WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola.\n\nDespite such risks and safety concerns, Congo's response effort has been robust. The Ministry of Health has 900 people active in the response, according to Jasarevic, and of these, 85% are from the local area. Additionally, WHO has deployed 300 of its own staff to the region.\n\nThe latest minstry report indicates that 37,559 people have received an experimental vaccine in a campaign that began August 8. \"This includes over 11,100 health and frontline workers, and 9,300 children,\" Jasarevic said.\n\nThe experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to WHO.\n\nGostin and his co-authors are doubtful. \"Despite deploying an experimental vaccine, cases doubled in October 2018,\" they wrote. More generally, they believe that the overall response, which also includes contact tracing and investigational treatments, may not be adequate.\n\n'Cascading transmission' of the disease\n\n\"Of 137 confirmed cases between October 28 and November 26, only 19 were found through contact tracing, 32 were on contact lists but lost to follow-up, and 83 (61%) had no known links to confirmed cases,\" Gostin and his co-authors wrote. \"These data suggest contact tracing and vaccination have not prevented cascading transmission.\"\n\nGostin also believes that \"community distrust is deep after decades-long humanitarian crises, impeding information-sharing and cooperation.\" They note that WHO and UN pledged enhanced security operations this month, \"yet lethal attacks have persisted.\"\n\nNora Love, field director for the International Rescue Committee's operations in the region, offers a more nuanced view.\n\nFrom mid-September through the end of last week, the nonprofit humanitarian group has trained over 730 health care workers who staff the dozens of health care facilities between the group's two field offices in Beni and Butembo.\n\n\"It's a very lush green area that rains every day, and the temperatures are pretty nice, but it's definitely a city at the edge of a country, and you can see that it also has been under conflict. There's definitely a tension within the communities here,\" Love said. \"You know that you're in a conflict area. There's always some sort of insecurity happening every single day.\"\n\nDespite this, she does not feel \"unwelcome here from the community,\" she said, and she does not feel under threat because she works within health facilities, \"which are a little bit more isolated than going to a village.\"\n\nGetting ahead of an infectious disease\n\n\"The people who are doing the safe burials have been the most exposed and the most vulnerable because people are very emotional after they lost a loved one,\" Love said. \"And the protocols for safe burial are different than the traditional burials here, and that causes some distress within the community.\"\n\nTraditional burials involve touching the body of the deceased. To prevent spread of the infectious disease, safe burials require protective equipment and sanitizing the family's environment.\n\nStill, Love has witnessed \"violent reactions\" at hospitals and health facilities when deaths occur. Patients have been forcefully removed from the hospital by their loved ones, she said.\n\n\"Last week, they went to a hospital when somebody died, and they did vandalism and burned some things,\" Love said. \"Luckily, so far, no health workers have been harmed by this, but there's always a watching and being aware that it could flare up.\"\n\nViolence is not the only challenge, as Beni has recently experienced a \"significant increase\" in the number of malaria cases, according to a recent report from the Ministry of Health.\n\nLove's main frustration has been the difficulty of getting \"ahead of things. Just when we feel we've made strides in one location, then the outbreak has moved somewhere else,\" she said. As a result, her organization has been exploring new strategies to see whether it can become more flexible and more rapid in its response.\n\nMeanwhile, the larger response persists.

Individual-1 was identified in court filings as Trump, and Cohen identified him as such in a New York courtroom Thursday.\n\nCohen, who famously once declared he would \"take a bullet\" for Trump, is cooperating with Mueller and has spoken with the special counsel's office for more than 70 hours on topics beyond Moscow, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.\n\nHe pleaded guilty earlier this year to eight counts in a separate case from the Manhattan US attorney's office. Cohen did not have an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors on that case.\n\nThursday's revelations are potentially significant because they appear to show that Trump was engaged in business dealings with Russia in the midst of a campaign in which Moscow interfered to help elect him.\n\nThey could also intersect with other information that Mueller knows to create political and legal jeopardy for the President.\n\nTrump responded to Cohen's admission at the White House on Thursday, calling his former lawyer \"very weak.\"\n\n\"He's a weak person,\" Trump said before departing for Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n\"He was convicted with a fairly long-term sentence with things unrelated to the Trump Organization,\" Trump said. \"What he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence.\"\n\nIn fact, Cohen hasn't been sentenced in either case, and the charges to which he pleaded guilty in August included information about his reimbursement by the Trump Organization for payments he made or helped orchestrate to conceal allegations from two women about sexual encounters with Trump before he ran for office. Trump has denied those claims.\n\nThe Justice Department notified Trump's legal team on Wednesday night about Cohen's planned plea, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, although it is unclear when the President himself was informed.\n\nCohen was also charged in the Manhattan US attorney's office case with tax fraud and false statements to a bank. He is scheduled to be sentenced in both cases on December 12.\n\nCohen left the courthouse Thursday without making a statement.\n\nJUST WATCHED Schiff: If Cohen misled, Trump misled country Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schiff: If Cohen misled, Trump misled country 01:18\n\nCooperating with Mueller\n\nCohen's cooperation with Mueller has included meetings with federal prosecutors on at least seven occasions beginning August 7, 2018, two weeks before he was first charged in New York, according to court filings.\n\nCohen had previously said talks about the Moscow project had ended in January 2016.\n\nIn a letter to Congress and in congressional testimony, Cohen had also stated that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project, and that he hadn't considered asking Trump to travel for the project. He had also said he didn't recall speaking to the Russian government about the project.\n\nAll of those statements were false, Cohen said Thursday.\n\n\"In truth and in fact, and as Cohen well knew, Cohen's representations about the Moscow Project he made to (House and Senate Intelligence committees) were false and misleading,\" Mueller's office said in a court filing.\n\n\"Cohen made the false statements to (1) minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1 and (2) give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and . . . the very first primary,' in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations,\" prosecutors said in court filings.\n\nDiscussions with 'Individual-2' on Moscow project\n\nThe charges provide a much fuller picture of the Trump Organization's efforts to advance the project in Moscow.\n\nAs late as June 2016, according to prosecutors, Cohen and another man, identified in filings as \"Individual-2,\" discussed efforts to gain Russian government approval for the Moscow project. Individual-2 is Felix Sater, a Russian-born onetime business associate of Trump's, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCohen discussed the project with Trump on more than the three occasions he had previously mentioned, prosecutors said, and he briefed Trump family members working within the Trump Organization about the efforts. Cohen also agreed to travel to Russia and asked Trump about the possibility of Trump going there in service of the project. In addition, Cohen \"asked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nIn May 2016, after Sater asked Cohen when the trip involving Trump should occur, Cohen responded that Trump's trip should take place \"once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\" Sater and Cohen communicated extensively about plans for Cohen's own prospective trip, filings show, but in June 2016, Cohen told Sater he wouldn't go. In court Thursday, Cohen added: \"I would like to note that I did not in fact travel there, nor have I ever been to Russia.\"\n\nAfter Cohen outlined his lies concerning the extent of his discussion with Trump and his plans for travel to Russia, a special counsel prosecutor, L. Rush Atkinson, told US District Judge Andrew Carter that Cohen had neglected to admit to a third set of falsehoods -- those concerning his direct contact with the Russian government about the Moscow project.\n\nCohen had had a 20-minute phone call with a representative of the Kremlin in January 2016, according to filings. Atkinson was joined in court Thursday by special counsel prosecutors Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Goldstein.\n\nThe charge to which Cohen pleaded Thursday carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000 and supervised release of no more than three years.\n\nDemocrats vow to investigate\n\nHouse Democrats, who will retake the majority early next year, plan to use their new power to investigate the disclosures revealed in the new set of charges against Cohen.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman, said his panel will try to bring in Cohen and investigate whether there was any money laundering by the Russians through the Trump Organization.\n\n\"If Mr. Cohen misled the Congress about the President's business dealings in Russia deep into the campaign, it also means that the President misled the country about his business dealings, and that the Russians were apparently attempting to gain financial leverage over the potential President of the United States,\" Schiff told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\n\nStatus of Mueller investigation\n\nTrump has criticized the Mueller probe and his own Justice Department almost daily, fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month and has hinted at a pardon for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nBut Cohen is the latest former Trump associate to say he lied -- apparently to protect the President -- a circle of defense that now seems to be quickly unraveling.\n\nThe news comes a few weeks after the President installed a skeptic of the Russia probe, Matt Whitaker, as his acting attorney general. The move was seen by some critics as an attempt to disrupt Mueller and to stop him from making new indictments.\n\nThe latest charges also cross what Trump has set as a red line -- an investigation into his family's business empire -- that the President has warned would cause him to fire the special counsel.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump Tower Moscow concept included idea of giving penthouse to Putin", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/8kXXr0D48-k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) One idea considered for the proposed Trump Tower in Moscow was to offer Russian President Vladimir Putin the penthouse, according to Felix Sater, who was working on the project with Michael Cohen.\n\nSater, a Russian-born onetime business associate of Trump's, described the concept as a \"marketing ploy\" and explained that the idea was to try to enhance the value and attraction for buyers by having Putin in the building.\n\nBuzzFeed, which first reported on the plan, reported that Cohen, who was then-candidate Donald Trump's attorney, had discussed the idea with a representative of Putin's press secretary, citing two law enforcement sources.

The guilty plea doesn't state which family members Cohen is referring to or when he spoke with them. It would not be illegal to discuss the plans with Trump's children, who were helping steer the business.\n\nAt least one of Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., a loyal surrogate for his father on the campaign trail, has provided testimony under oath to at least three congressional committees where he was asked about the proposed deal. Most of that testimony is not public and it isn't clear how detailed the questions were about the project. Yet it could place him in legal jeopardy if anything he told Congress conflicts with information provided by Cohen if it is supported by other evidence.\n\nA person close to the company tells CNN that Trump Jr. did know about the project as did his sister, Ivanka, whose involvement was limited to recommending architects and designers. The source says Trump Jr.'s testimony that his knowledge was \"peripheral\" is \"100% accurate.\"\n\nThe source added that the Trump Organization found one email involving Trump Jr. and a few that included Ivanka, but said all of those communications were sent before January 2016.\n\nOne House panel said in a footnote to a report that Trump Jr. told them he believed the Moscow project was dormant as of early June 2016. But it was not clear the context of what Trump Jr. was asked or exactly how he answered it.\n\n\"All communications, all document that we have [about] Trump Moscow end by January 2016,\" the source said. The person added, if Cohen continued to work on the project into 2016 \"we weren't aware of it.\"\n\nIt is not clear if Trump Jr. has testified before the special counsel and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nTrump Jr. is already under the spotlight because of his role in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that he agreed to take after being told a Russian lawyer had incriminating information on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe President has previously said an investigation into the Trump Organization, his family's closely-held business, would be a red line for him in terms of his tolerance for the special counsel probe.\n\nFollowing the guilty plea Thursday, Trump called Cohen a liar, saying on the South Lawn of the White House. \" Michael Cohen is lying and he's trying to get a reduced sentence for things that have nothing to do with me,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President defended the deal for a possible Trump real estate venture in Moscow. The project, Trump said, \"lasted a short period of time,\" adding that he decided not to do it because he wanted to focus on running for president. In Cohen's now-discredited testimony, he told lawmakers that he made the decision to terminate the deal on his own without consulting with Trump or any members of the Trump family.\n\nHowever, the President maintained Thursday that \"there would've been nothing wrong if I did do it.\"\n\nThe overlap of Trump's business ties and his political ambitions has been a knotty issue for him since the campaign. He only handed the reins of his business over to his two sons and chief financial officer on the eve of his inauguration, keeping his hand on the steering wheels during the campaign.\n\nTrump kept a firm grip on the business before he took the oath of office in 2017, with key decisions about projects belonging to him and his children Trump Jr, and Ivanka Trump. They were more intimately involved in real estate projects than their younger brother, Eric Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump was often at her father's side and visited projects. She posted a photo of her at a construction site for a project in Azerbaijan on Instagram while both Trump Jr. and his sister attended ribbon cutting ceremonies at project announcements and openings around the globe, from Trump Soho in New York to condo-hotel projects in Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Organization and Trump Jr., did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Ivanka Trump declined to comment.\n\nDiscussions over the Trump Tower Moscow project began in 2015 and by October 28, Trump had signed preliminary agreement that would have brought $4 million in fees to his business to work with a Russian to develop a luxury hotel.\n\nAccording to documents provided to CNN, the project under discussion would have named the hotel spa named after Ivanka Trump. Trump's company was explicitly given the option to \"brand any or all portion of the spa or fitness facilities as 'The Spa by Ivanka Trump' or similar brand,\" according to the document. And if they did name it after Trump's daughter, then Ivanka or her designee would be given \"sole and absolute discretion\" to approve \"all interior design elements of the spa or fitness facilities,\" the document says.\n\nThe deal never came to fruition.\n\nThe only one of Trump's children who has testified under oath about the Trump Tower Moscow effort in 2015 and 2016 is Trump Jr., who was questioned by several congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in the election.\n\nTrump Jr was asked by the House Judiciary Committee if he had any involvement in the potential deal. He responded, under oath, \"Like I said, I was peripherally aware of it, but most of my knowledge has been gained since as it relates to hearing about it over the last few weeks,\" according to a transcript of the interview, which occurred in September 2017, shortly after Cohen publicly revealed details about the Trump Tower Moscow proposal.\n\nHe also testified before the Senate and House Intelligence committees. The House Intelligence panel report released by the Republicans references Trump Jr.'s testimony about the Moscow deal. The report says in a footnote, \"Trump Jr. testified that, as of early June 2016, he believed the Trump Tower Moscow project was dormant.\"\n\nBy contrast, Cohen says he lied when he told lawmakers the deal talks ended in January. The House report does not provide direct quotes from Trump Jr.'s testimony. The Senate has not released any information about Trump Jr.'s testimony.\n\nCohen's guilty plea does not indicate when he briefed the family members about his dealings to get the project off the ground. The source close to the Trump Organization said, \"Michael's modus operandi is to work independently. He doesn't have a great history in including people in the discussion. And on this project, everything that we've seen and all the prep we've done of Don (Jr.) indicates he really knew nothing about this project.\"\n\nAccording to court papers filed Thursday, Cohen spoke with the assistant to Putin's spokesman in January about moving the project forward and possible financing. He also discussed traveling to Moscow in early May 2016 adding that Trump could travel \"once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\"\n\nCohen spoke again in June with a person identified as \"Individual 2\" in Thursday's court filings but known to be Felix Sater, a Russian-American business partner who was involved in other Trump Organization projects in Florida and New York.\n\nBetween June 9 and June 14, 2016, the court papers allege, Sater sent multiple messages to Cohen about traveling, including forms for Cohen to fill out.\n\nCohen met with Sater in the lobby of Trump Tower on June 14, 2016, to tell Sater he wouldn't be traveling.\n\nSater has shared documents with the special counsel's office. He has been a government informant for years stemming from his role in a stock manipulation scheme from the late 1990s. Sater's attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump Tower meeting on Clinton\n\nThe Moscow project overlaps with another critical meeting that is of interest to the special counsel's investigation.\n\nOn June 3, a publicist for a Russian pop star reached out to Trump Jr. to arrange a meeting with a Russian lawyer promising incriminating information on presidential rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeveral phone calls, including one to a blocked phone number, followed.\n\nTrump Jr. had several brief phone calls with Emin Agalarov, the son of a Russian real estate magnate, who requested the meeting. Trump Jr. told lawmakers he didn't recall speaking with Emin ahead of the June 9 meeting.\n\nNestled between those calls was one made to a blocked number. Lawmakers have openly suggested Trump Jr. may have called his father on that line. During its investigation, the House Intelligence Committee heard testimony that Trump's primary residence has a blocked phone line.\n\nTrump Jr. told lawmakers \"I have no idea\" who the blocked call was with. When asked if he told his father about the meeting or the underlying offer he said, \"No, I did not.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Former Trump White House lawyer emerges as a contender for attorney general", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/KIVCetJcMsA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is considering tapping the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim , to become the next attorney general, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nDelrahim is one of several people under consideration for the job, and has close ties to the Trump White House. As a deputy to then-White House counsel Don McGahn, Delrahim helped shepherd the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, which Trump has touted as one of his signature accomplishments.\n\nTwo months after joining the Justice Department in September 2017 as chief of the antitrust division, Delrahim led the government's suit to block AT&T's takeover of Time Warner Inc., a move that puzzled a number of legal experts and contradicted Delrahim's own prior stance.\n\nCNN, which was part of Time Warner and is now owned by AT&T, is a frequent target of the President, who promised to block the deal during the campaign in 2016. Delrahim has denied he ever received direct orders from Trump to stop the acquisition. A district judge approved the deal in June. Delrahim's anti-trust division has appealed\n\nA source familiar with the process tells CNN that the White House likes Delrahim's diverse background (he was born in Iran) and the fact that he's already been confirmed, which would make it harder to justify rejecting him should he come up for confirmation as attorney general. Asked why the White House would like Delrahim, a former White House official said, \"He was our guy.\"\n\nTrump in no rush\n\nStill, White House officials say the President is in no rush to nominate a permanent successor to Jeff Sessions, who he fired Nov. 7. Instead, Trump has told confidantes he is happy to leave the man he named acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, in place while he mulls his choices.\n\nWhitaker is a former US attorney from Iowa, who had been serving as Sessions' chief of staff, but was never confirmed by the Senate for that position.\n\nNow, he faces a number of legal challenges to his appointment. The latest salvo comes in a petition filed with the Supreme Court Thursday morning. A lawyer already challenging the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment told the Supreme Court justices that Whitaker's appointment places the country is in a moment of \"constitutional crisis\" and that they should respond to a \"power grab designed to protect the President personally by evading the authority and responsibility of the Senate and this Court under the Constitution.\"\n\nThough there is a debate over the validity of his appointment, under federal rules Whitaker can remain in his acting role for 210 days, which would take him into June. Once a nominee is selected, Whitaker can stay through the confirmation process. If that nominee fails to get confirmed, then the clock on Whitaker would restart at 210 days.\n\nWhitaker's selection was met by a torrent of stories that dug into his public criticism of the Mueller probe, which he now oversees. Notably, a source familiar with the process says Whitaker was informed of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's plea ahead of time. Whitaker has also drawn fire for his links to a patenting company shut down by the government this year over allegations of fraud.\n\nBut rather than being put off by it, officials say the President actually took satisfaction from the outcry, believing the consternation from television pundits and Democrats meant he chose well.\n\nAs of now though, sources say Trump doesn't plan on naming Whitaker to the job permanently, believing he has a chance to name someone of a more elevated stature who will act as a supportive voice within the administration.\n\nOther candidates\n\nThat's provided an opening for allies of the President, and potential picks themselves, to lobby for the job. As is his custom, Trump has polled friends and advisers about potential selections, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\n\"A lot of people want that job. It's a great job, if you're into the world,\" Trump said Monday at a roundtable rally in Mississippi. \"We have a lot of good people ... we have no dearth of talent, I can tell you that.\"\n\nAlong with Delrahim, CNN has previously reported that the President is considering former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida's Republican Attorney General Pamela Bondi for the job.\n\nMany Trump allies like Bondi, who appears frequently on Fox News, and she has long enjoyed a good relationship with the President.\n\n\"I'd consider Pam Bondi for anything,\" Trump said earlier this month.\n\nStill, she could face a difficult confirmation given the $25,000 contribution her political action committee received from Trump's foundation during her 2014 re-election bid.\n\nThe donation came around the time Bondi's office was reviewing complaints about Trump University and Democrats leveled allegations of impropriety after her office declined to pursue an investigation into Trump University fraud allegations.\n\nA Florida ethics panel cleared Bondi of wrongdoing last year.\n\nCurrent labor secretary Alex Acosta has also been under consideration, but a recent report from the Miami Herald likely jeopardizes that. On Tuesday, the Herald reported that in 2007 Acosta, then a US attorney in Florida, offered a plea deal to millionaire hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein, despite substantial evidence that he had engaged in an extensive sex trafficking scheme involving underage girls that could have landed him a life sentence in prison under federal law.\n\nInstead, Epstein pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges, and served only 13 months. The agreement made by Acosta, the Herald said, \"essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe\" and further granted immunity to \"any potential co-conspirators\" in the case.\n\nEric Holland, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor, said in an emailed response to the report that \"this matter has been publicly addressed previously, including during confirmation hearings.\" At his confirmation hearing, Acosta defended his decision, saying there was broad consensus in his office.\n\nA senior Trump administration official told CNN on Wednesday that Acosta's chances to become attorney general are in serious doubt. Another source familiar with the attorney general process said Thursday Acosta had been ruled out.\n\nOther names that have been floated as possible replacements for Sessions include Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, a former federal prosecutor, as well John Michael Luttig, a former US Court of Appeals judge and Justice Department official, and current general counsel at Boeing. One former White House official said Luttig is a strong possibility, though he has not met with the President. A second source close to Luttig says that he was considered for the role of FBI director after James Comey was fired.\n\nSources familiar with the matter say that William \"Bill\" Barr, a veteran Washington lawyer who served as US attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, has also been mentioned as a potential candidate. It's not clear however if either Barr or Luttig would accept the nomination if offered.\n\nSpecial Counsel\n\nOne person likely not under consideration is Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who remains on the job despite continued speculation that he will resign or get fired. Rosenstein's face was among those included in an image the President retweeted Wednesday showing prominent Democrats and Trump critics behind bars. Asked by the New York Post why he felt Rosenstein should be behind bars, Trump answered, \"He should have never picked a special counsel.\"\n\nAfter Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein selected Robert Mueller as special counsel. With Whitaker at the helm, Rosenstein no longer technically oversees the Mueller investigation, but his office still manages it day-to-day. Sources tell CNN that the White House no longer views Rosenstein as a threat, and it's widely expected he'll stay on until the next attorney general is confirmed.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say part of the reason that the President is in no rush to nominate a permanent attorney general is that he doesn't want to leave too much time until hearings can commence when a new Congress convenes in January. That gap could allow opposition groups to unearth damaging details that could hamper a confirmation process that's already expected to be contentious.\n\nAlso contributing to the slow pace is the current transition underway in the White House counsel's office, which would traditionally shepherd an attorney general nomination from the selection process through to Senate confirmation. Incoming counsel Pat Cipollone has not yet formally started in the post; his predecessor Don McGahn departed in October.\n\nWhitaker under fire\n\nMeanwhile, Whitaker has faced a drumbeat of criticism.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson told CNN earlier this month Whitaker is \"fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures,\" including \"consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal.\"\n\nBut Whitaker has refused to explain whether he has, in fact, engaged career ethics officials at DOJ to review whether he needs to step aside from oversight of the Mueller investigation. After meeting with Whitaker on Capitol Hill, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that Whitaker conveyed that \"he believed he did not have a reason to recuse himself legally or factually.\"\n\nAt a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting the week before Thanksgiving, Senate Democrats took shots at Whitaker, questioning the constitutionality of his appointment and his history of public antagonism towards the Russia probe.\n\nScrutiny continued on Tuesday when the head of the Federal Trade Commission offered to brief senators on a case the agency had litigated against a Florida company connected to Whitaker that they called a \"scam\" in court.\n\nIn May, World Patent Marketing, which Whitaker sat on the advisory board of, agreed to pay a nearly $26 million judgment as part of a settlement agreement. A judge has partially suspended that payment. Legal filings from the FTC in the case revealed Whitaker himself once sent a threatening email to a disgruntled customer, accusing them of extortion.\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement, earlier this month, that Whitaker \"has said he was not aware of any fraudulent activity. Any stories suggesting otherwise are false.\"\n\nStaff from the FTC are expected to brief lawmakers on the case on Friday, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nFor his part, Whitaker has settled into his position as the acting chief law enforcement officer, meeting this week with leading national police groups at the Justice Department and law enforcement officials in Tennessee and Ohio.\n\nAddressing the Memphis US attorney on Wednesday in front of a crowd of prosecutors there, Whitaker drew laughs with an apparent wink to his situation.\n\n\"I continue to believe that the United States attorney job is the best job that anybody could ever have. So you're lucky to have it. Just be careful what you volunteer for next,\" Whitaker said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: The smoke around Donald Trump and Russia is choking his presidency", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/h0V85UUiWBQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) NO COLLUSION, Donald Trump will tell you -- or, really, anyone -- if you ask about the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the possibility that members of the Trump orbit colluded with the Russians to help him win.\n\nAnd Trump is right! There is no definitive proof that he colluded with the Russians to throw the election his way. There's no smoking gun.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nBut, boy oh boy, is there a lot of smoke. So much smoke that it is choking the Trump administration's ability to do almost anything.\n\nConsider what we learned Thursday morning when former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the nature and length of his interactions with Russians regarding the potential construction of a Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\nCohen had previously said that conversations about the possibility of a Trump-named development in Moscow ended in January 2016 -- coinciding with the beginning of the presidential primary season. On Thursday, Cohen admitted he had lied about that timing -- he had multiple conversations about the project until June 2016, briefed members of the Trump family about the progress of those conversations and even agreed to travel to Russia to discuss the project and raise the possibility of Trump doing the same.\n\nCohen said in court that he made those false statements in order to be consistent with Trump's political messaging and to be loyal to Trump.\n\nThat information runs directly counter to Trump's repeated assertions during the 2016 campaign -- and after he became president -- that he had no business dealings in Russia.\n\n\"I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia. And even -- for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt, and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago.\"\n\n\"What do I know about the Russians? What do I know about the Russians? Then they said he borrows money from - I don't borrow money from the Russians. I promise you I've never made - I don't have any deals with Russia. I had Miss Universe there a couple of years ago other than that no. I had nothing to do.\"\n\n\"And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.\"\n\nNow, even in light of Cohen's plea deal Thursday, Trump wasn't outright lying in any of those quotes. He didn't have active business dealings with Russia when he spoke in July 2016. But man, he is cutting it very, very close. If he's not outright lying, then he's not telling anything close to the full truth either.\n\nSpeaking of lying, that's what Trump accused Cohen of doing in his plea deal.\n\n\"He's a weak person,\" Trump said before taking off for the G20 summit in Argentina. \"He was convicted with a fairly long-term sentence with things unrelated to the Trump Organization. What he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence.\" ( Cohen previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to a series of crimes including willful breaking of campaign finance law.)\n\nCould Cohen be lying? Sure! After all, he lied to Congress already!\n\nBut Cohen is the one who is risking his plea deal if it turns out he lied under oath to special counsel Robert Mueller and his team. Trump, by comparison, can say -- and tweet -- whatever he likes publicly without any criminal concerns. (The same is not true, of course, of the written answers to Mueller's questions that Trump and his legal team submitted last week.)\n\nThe smoke thrown off by the Cohen plea deal alone is substantial. But it only adds to all the other smoke that's already in the atmosphere surrounding Trump, his closest associates and Russians.\n\nWe know, for example, that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met with a lawyer linked to the Kremlin at Trump Tower in June 2016, lured to the meeting by a promise from the Russians that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nI could go on -- and on -- but you get the idea. And if you don't get the idea then, well, you're trying not to get the idea.\n\nIs it possible -- as Trump forever claims -- that all of this smoke is just smoke? That there is no actual fire? No proof of anything?\n\nSure. We don't have the Mueller report yet. And what we know publicly is smoke, not a full-on fire. But it is a whole hell of a lot of smoke. And it's making it very hard for the Trump administration to see anything at all."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Destroyed: How the trashing of rape kits failed victims and jeopardizes public safety", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DPfoz5Rd6Cw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Editor\u2019s note These stories contain graphic language used in police documents on rape cases. CNN chose to quote directly from the documents rather than use vague or euphemistic language that fails to convey the violence of the crimes. Reporters were unable to identify and reach most victims because police redacted their names, addresses and other identifying information in the case files. Where police did not redact that information, CNN did, including the full names of suspects who were not charged.\n\nHours after you are raped, you sit in a hospital room, under fluorescent lights, and consent to a forensic exam. Your body is the crime scene. When did it happen, a nurse asks. Where did it happen? Can you tell me who did this to you? The nurse is trained to interview you and search your body for evidence left behind by your attacker. Knowing the details of your assault guides the examination. Did he ejaculate inside of you, on you? Where did he touch you? Did he use any objects? Did he kiss you, lick you? Have you had anything to drink? Did you shower? You\u2019re asked to undress slowly while you stand on a special sheet meant to collect any trace evidence that shakes loose. For three to five hours, the nurse swabs your mouth, your breasts, a bite mark on your neck. She scrapes under your fingernails, combs your pubic hair. She inserts a speculum inside you and drops blue dye on the tissue there to illuminate any places that are torn. The nurse cuts a hair from your head. She takes photographs of your face and shoulders to pair with your chart, of you in the clothes you wore when you were attacked. Every injury is photographed, too \u2014 far away, close-up, with a ruler to show size. When the exam is over, the nurse puts hair, fibers, swabs, vials of blood and urine in a container smaller than a shoebox. She seals it \u2014 your rape kit \u2014 and entrusts it to a police officer. This North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed. Read her full story here: \u2018They treated me like trash.\u2019 Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN This is the way DNA evidence is collected. This is what you endure so police can identify your assailant, make him pay for what he did. No one tells you that the exam may be pointless \u2014 that police might treat your kit like trash. A CNN investigation into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. The number is likely higher and was arrived at through an analysis of the departments\u2019 own records. The destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete investigations that relegated rape kits to shelves in police evidence rooms until they were destroyed. Dozens were trashed mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence, records showed. Almost 80% were never tested for DNA evidence, a process that can identify a suspect or link that person to other crimes. For the past several years, public attention has focused on the hundreds of thousands of kits that have languished untested. The Justice Department has awarded more than $150 million to test that backlog. But destruction of rape kits is a lesser-known and more fundamental problem: The evidence is gone. It can never be used to lock up a rapist or set free the wrongfully convicted. Rape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN \u201cAll the attention toward untested kits isn\u2019t enough if we have agencies destroying kits,\u201d said Wayne County, Michigan, Prosecutor Kym Worthy, whose testing of some 10,000 backlogged rape kits has identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. \u201cEach one of these kits represents a victim,\u201d said the Detroit-based prosecutor. \u201cWhat you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\u201d What you are doing [\u2026] is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice. Kym Worthy | Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor A woman who reported being gang-raped in 2007 said it was \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d to recently learn that police destroyed her untested kit. She remembered the nurse at a hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, asking her to describe what the four men did so that her body could be positioned in a way that allowed for more precise examination. \u201cIt was very invasive,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was very degrading. The level of exposure \u2026 was a second violation.\u201d But she steeled herself because the nurse was collecting evidence, and she believed police would test it and use it in their investigation. Instead, CNN found, the detective assigned to her case did nothing more than interview her. The officer never tried to talk to the men she named as her attackers, misinterpreted the law and concluded that no rape occurred. About a month after speaking with the woman, the detective authorized destruction of the untested rape kit \u2014 in a state where there was no time limit to prosecute rape. \u201cI counted on the police to do what they were supposed to do \u2014 to investigate what happened to me and to test that evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, they treated it like trash. They treated me like trash.\u201d For some victims, the rape exam feels like a second trauma. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Veteran sex crimes investigators, along with experts in the law, trauma and forensic science, reviewed case files for CNN. They said investigations indicated that police lacked training in how to interact with victims of sexual violence; in the importance of testing kits, not only to solve the reported assaults but potentially other crimes; and in the need to preserve kits for the length of time the law allows for a prosecution. \u201cWhat CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\u201d said Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant who ran the San Diego Police sex crimes unit for a decade. She examined 56 case files from more than a dozen departments. What CNN discovered is a systemic problem. Joanne Archambault | Former head of San Diego Police sex crimes unit \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2014 but it\u2019s not the norm \u2014 that law enforcement should keep evidence at least for the statute of limitations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are mistakes in these cases, but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\u201d Twenty-five agencies in 14 states destroyed kits tied to cases while they could still be prosecuted. Department leaders at some agencies defended the destruction by saying officers approved disposal of kits in closed cases they believed had no chance of moving forward. This was a routine process, they said, done to make space in evidence rooms. Who destroyed? Law enforcement agencies responded to CNN\u2019s findings. At least five departments acknowledged that the decision to destroy kits was made without considering the statutes of limitations. Three stopped trashing kits because of CNN\u2019s inquiries. Experts said the destruction shows that rape is treated differently than other violent crimes. \u201cWould we test all the evidence\u201d in a murder? \u201cYou bet,\u201d said police trainer Tom Tremblay. The former Vermont police chief, who has reviewed rape investigations for the US Department of Justice, examined cases from nine agencies. The language police sometimes used, he and other experts said, suggested bias \u2014 describing victims\u2019 accounts of their rapes as \u201chaving sex,\u201d asking whether victims experienced orgasms and focusing on a victim\u2019s behavior rather than the suspect\u2019s. All of it, Tremblay said, communicates one thing to a victim: You are not believed. Kym Worthy: The prosecutor is herself a rape survivor. She calls the destruction of rape kits a betrayal. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Worthy understands personally what\u2019s at stake. She isn\u2019t just a prosecutor; she\u2019s a survivor. She was raped in law school, she said, and \u2014 like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally \u2014 chose not to report her attack. It is a triumph, Worthy said, when a victim musters the courage to go to police and consent to a rape exam. And destroying a rape kit is a betrayal.\n\nDuring a life-threatening trauma like rape, the defense circuitry of the brain drives the victim\u2019s sole objective: to survive. Reflexes govern reaction \u2014 running away, punching the attacker, lying there paralyzed. Stress hormones can impair a victim\u2019s memory and the ability to make complex, rational decisions. Investigators trained in the effects of trauma know that a victim\u2019s first account of an assault may not be complete, experts said, and it may not be the best time to ask some questions. Yet documents CNN examined showed officers sometimes asked questions that threatened to overwhelm victims or put them on the defensive. Did you say no? Did you fight back? Why didn\u2019t you call police right away? Though experts say victims should be interviewed wherever they feel most comfortable, documents showed police sometimes ask them to come to the station, just as they do suspects. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A traumatized person\u2019s instinct is often to avoid the pain that can come from retelling or reliving the experience. Avoidance and withdrawal are common symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But when victims pulled away from investigations soon after they reported being assaulted, when the trauma was fresh, some police officers were quick to label them uncooperative and close their cases. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to sniff out the liar,\u201d said Justin Boardman, a former Utah police detective who teaches cops how to understand trauma. \u201cSo when you don\u2019t give us this training that says \u2014 \u2018Oh, she\u2019s pulling away because she\u2019s traumatized, or she can\u2019t tell me this detail because she legit can\u2019t remember\u2019 \u2014 we think she\u2019s lying or she\u2019s hiding something.\u201d Experts who reviewed cases said detectives appeared to rush victims into making consequential decisions, effectively ending some cases. They noted that investigators violated longstanding best practices by asking victims if they wanted to prosecute their attackers soon after reporting the assaults to police \u2014 sometimes the same day. That question, they said, can intimidate victims and cause them to withdraw. Resources For help, survivors can call 800-656-4673. More guidance for victims and training for investigators can be found here. Prosecution should be discussed only after a thorough investigation is complete, experts said, when a prosecutor \u2014 not a victim \u2014 has determined that charges can be filed. Some victims who expressed reluctance to proceed with a prosecution were asked to sign forms attesting to that. But victims should not be given waivers declining prosecution, according to guidelines by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as far back as 2005. Only the statute of limitations should constrain a victim\u2019s right to change her or his mind about moving forward with a prosecution, the association says. More recently issued guidelines also stress that an investigator should try to spend time building rapport with a victim. Unless the public is in imminent danger, law enforcement should work at a pace comfortable for the victim. Some case files showed detectives closed cases and called victims uncooperative if they didn\u2019t meet arbitrary deadlines. In North Charleston, South Carolina, a woman reported being raped at knifepoint by a man who had once been a sexual partner. Police noted she\u2019d been arrested for prostitution two years earlier and quizzed her about whether he was a client. She told them no. Though she did not know her assailant\u2019s name, she called police twice after her initial interview with information she thought might help identify him, according to the case file. But when she failed to return a detective\u2019s call in a week\u2019s time, he wrote that she was uncooperative and ended the investigation 17 days after she reported being raped. Her kit \u2014 never tested \u2014 was destroyed less than a year later, even though testing might have identified the man. There was no statute of limitations on the crime, meaning the woman should have had as much time as she needed to help police pursue her assailant. Rape survivors expect the evidence taken from their bodies to be sealed up, given to police and sent to a lab for testing. CNN found hundreds of kits were destroyed without being analyzed. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN North Charleston\u2019s detective bureau commander, Major Scott Perry, declined to specify why the kit was destroyed. \u201cEach case is evaluated on its own facts,\u201d he said, adding that the investigation could be reopened at any time if the victim re-approached police. He conceded, however, that not having the rape kit would make the case \u201cmore difficult to prosecute.\u201d In Springfield, Missouri, police labeled victims uncooperative when they didn\u2019t respond to letters mailed to their homes warning that they had 10 business days to contact a detective or their assaults would not be further investigated. In at least six cases, records show, a detective sent the letter the day the officer was assigned to investigate. The victims had undergone rape exams and given initial accounts to patrol officers, actions that demonstrated a desire for the crimes to be investigated. But when victims didn\u2019t meet that 10-day deadline, Springfield police sometimes sent another letter, telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d to respond led to the closing of their cases. The kits were later destroyed, even though the crimes remained within the statutes of limitations. \u2018Failure\u2019 to cooperate When Springfield victims didn\u2019t meet detectives\u2019 deadlines, police sent another letter telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d led to the closing of their cases. Source: Springfield Police Department Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said the 10-day letter is a tool used in all kinds of cases to spur a victim to work with police. He said investigators should use it only as a last resort \u2014 after a detective has exhausted every other means to reach a victim. He did not explain why some letters were sent immediately after victims reported being raped. The letter is \u201ca way to justify not doing your job,\u201d said Archambault, the retired San Diego sex crimes investigator who reviewed cases. It should never be sent to rape victims, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous. This type of response will guarantee that the majority of victims will not participate in the investigation.\u201d Victims sometimes leave their homes because they are afraid an attacker will find them again. It\u2019s \u201cabsurd,\u201d she said, to expect victims to check the mail and respond to a demand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that [victims] are being uncooperative. They\u2019re just dealing with survival. They\u2019re trying to get out of bed, get their clothes on, get to work, get the kids to school,\u201d Archambault said. Police should instead give victims time \u2014 and access to counseling and services that help them feel safe, experts said. After that, they are far more likely to work with law enforcement. Joanne Archambault: The former sex crimes investigator says police label victims uncooperative, but \u201cthey\u2019re just dealing with survival.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A woman in West Valley, Utah, said she told police she was terrified that her rapist would hunt her down again, but she received neither time nor support. According to her case file, the woman told a patrol officer that a man she\u2019d broken up with came to her home and raped her. He ordered her to \u201cshut her mouth,\u201d or he would \u201churt her,\u201d she told the officer. He forced her into his car. She said she eventually managed to jump out and run into a K-Mart, where someone called 911. The woman gave police an initial statement about the assault and underwent a rape exam. Ten days later, on January 27, 2009, Detective Ryan Humphrey noted that she called him. She said she was \u201cscared to pursue charges,\u201d he wrote in the case file. He shut down the investigation. CNN reached the woman, who was upset to learn that her rape kit was destroyed and never tested. She called the failure to analyze it \u201cpathetic.\u201d Police did not offer to take steps to protect her, she said. If they had, she might have gained confidence and worked with police. She said she wishes they\u2019d told her, \u201c\u2018Well, we can still help you through this.\u2019\u201d (She asked that her name be withheld, and CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims.) Humphrey, who no longer works for the department, said that in the 10 days between the woman\u2019s report and her phone call, he did not try to locate and interview the suspect or do any other work on the case. Like investigators at other agencies, Humphrey said resources were tight, and he struggled under the weight of a heavy caseload. He closed the investigation, he said, because he assumed that the district attorney wouldn\u2019t file charges in a case without a victim\u2019s cooperation. As he reflected on the case, he acknowledged he could have given the woman more time by leaving the case open and trying to build trust and rapport with her. He could have done what experts said is protocol: offer her a safety plan to allay her fears, such as patrolling near her home or helping her file a restraining order. He agreed that the woman could have changed her mind and re-engaged when she was ready \u2014 her right in a state that had no statute of limitations to prosecute rape at the time she reported the crime. \u201cObviously, she wanted to pursue it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she went to the hospital and had a rape exam done.\u201d A specially trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner may spend three to five hours or more gathering evidence from a victim\u2019s body. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Humphrey said he did not authorize destruction of the woman\u2019s rape kit but understood that once he closed a case, the evidence would be disposed. Her kit should have been preserved, he said. Not keeping the investigation open was \u201ca mistake. I look back at this case and can see that\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere are many obstacles to a successful rape investigation. A victim is too scared to continue working with police. A suspect claims sex was consensual. Testing a kit doesn\u2019t crack a case. But those circumstances shouldn\u2019t necessarily end an investigation. Officers can press pause and set cases aside, then reopen them if there\u2019s a break \u2014 a victim changes his or her mind, new leads emerge, technology improves and evidence can be retested. Yet CNN identified 17 departments that destroyed a combined 92 kits in sex crimes investigations that police described as open or in other terms that mean the same thing, such as inactive or suspended. In Idaho, Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Chief Lee White acknowledged that his department discarded rape kits in cases marked inactive. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cit appears we were too quick at the trigger to dispose.\u201d In Farmington, New Mexico, police reported destroying kits in at least eight cases labeled inactive. Chief Steve Hebbe reviewed those cases and said the kits should not have been trashed. He then ordered a major change. \u201cWe will not destroy sexual assault kits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy them until after the statute of limitations is out.\u201d The chief also said he made sure his officers received fresh training in sex crimes investigations. Proper training includes an understanding of what DNA testing can do \u2014 even when suspects claim sex was consensual. In several departments, CNN found officers failed to test kits in so-called consent cases because they believed testing would only demonstrate that sex occurred, not whether a crime occurred. That\u2019s short-sighted, experts said. A DNA profile of the suspect in a consent case could match a DNA profile of an unidentified attacker in another rape, connecting those crimes and helping to solve them both. The testing of the backlog in Wayne County, Michigan, has linked kits in \u201cconsent\u201d cases to suspects in other sexual assaults, said prosecutor Worthy. CNN also discovered cases in which police listed \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d as a reason to destroy kits that were never analyzed. Testing might have produced evidence, advancing investigations while there was still time to prosecute. Even a tested kit that fails to yield DNA evidence during an initial analysis should be preserved, forensic experts said, because testing technology is constantly improving. DNA that couldn\u2019t be detected just a few years ago can sometimes be recovered today. Nakamura memo Two police departments \u2014 Salt Lake City and West Valley \u2014 continued to destroy rape kits after Salt Lake County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Blake Nakamura said he sent them a 2011 memo ordering that evidence be maintained. Source: Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office Blake Nakamura, the chief deputy prosecutor in Utah\u2019s Salt Lake County, said he came to understand the importance of preserving evidence in sex crimes cases years ago. Nakamura has been on both sides in the courtroom. As a private defense attorney, he successfully defended a man accused of sexually abusing a child by blocking the admission of evidence. When he became a prosecutor, he wanted to be able to admit all evidence and knew he had to protect rape kits from destruction. So in 2011, he sent a memo to police departments in his county, notifying them to keep all evidence in sex offense cases. At least two failed to follow his directive: Salt Lake City and West Valley. They provided records to CNN showing they continued to destroy kits for at least a couple more years. They also provided documentation showing why: Prosecutors in Nakamura\u2019s office approved the destruction. When CNN showed those records to Nakamura, he was irate. He later spoke with his staff in colorful language he said he couldn\u2019t share. But the prosecutor feels certain they got his message.\n\nIt is particularly egregious, experts said, to destroy rape kits belonging to children, the most vulnerable victims. Young victims often can\u2019t express what happened to them, so their rape kits can speak for them. The evidence can prove abuse because suspects, unlike in adult cases, can\u2019t argue that sexual contact was consensual. Children who report being sexually assaulted should be interviewed by experts trained in dealing with young victims. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Statutes of limitations for teenagers and children typically do not start until victims reach adulthood. \u201cIt takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\u201d said Marci Hamilton, a professor and attorney who analyzed juvenile cases for CNN to determine whether they had been destroyed before the statutes of limitations. \u201cWhat police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\u201d Hamilton and CNN identified 47 children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 rape kits that were destroyed before the statutes of limitations expired or where there was no time limit to prosecute. At least 39 were untested. CNN\u2019s analysis did not include \u201cunfounded\u201d cases, those in which police determined that no crime was attempted or occurred. But Hamilton, whose non-profit CHILD USA advocates for sexual abuse victims, argued that given the complexity of child sex abuse, juvenile reports should rarely be labeled unfounded. In Fallon, Nevada, a detective dismissed a 7-year-old\u2019s case as unfounded, partly because the child looked away from him as he questioned her in 2013. The girl described how a man had assaulted her anally, orally and vaginally the previous night, and then methodically cleansed her body. Even though the child was consistent in describing the incident to others, the detective said her body language \u2014 looking away \u2014 indicated she was being deceptive. The detective suggested to her parents that they get her psychological help. Marci Hamilton: The head of CHILD USA says children rarely report sexual abuse when it happens; when they do, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary. When they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Police destroyed the girl\u2019s untested rape kit seven months after the allegations of abuse were made. Experts said the 7-year-old\u2019s account should have raised a red flag; until children reach puberty and start to have sexual urges, they are generally incapable of imagining rape scenarios. The detective, they added, seemed to judge the child\u2019s body language as he would an adult\u2019s. The police chief in Fallon, Kevin Gehman, said the girl\u2019s account was fully investigated but acknowledged \u201csome weaknesses in the investigative process.\u201d He would not elaborate. CNN\u2019s questions about the case prompted a review of all sexual assault investigations by the police and the city attorney. As a result, the attorney instructed police to stop destroying rape kits. The statutes of limitations on sex crimes against children typically do not begin ticking until they reach legal adulthood. Melissa Golden/REDUX for CNN Hamilton and other experts said it is rare for minors to disclose abuse soon after it occurs. Out of fear or confusion \u2014 or because predators manipulate them \u2014 young victims may delay talking about what happened for years, if not decades. That\u2019s all the more reason to maintain their rape kits. When children report what happened immediately, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhen they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "5 takeaways from CNN's investigation into rape kit destruction", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/7IeaX3AyBoo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In the era of #MeToo and stories about the alleged perpetrators of sexual violence, CNN's exclusive investigation \"Destroyed\" turns the spotlight on those responsible for protecting the public.\n\nAn examination into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute.\n\nThe number is likely higher and was calculated by analyzing the departments' own records.\n\nThe destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete police investigations.\n\nMost of the kits were untested, CNN found, and dozens were discarded mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence.\n\nJournalists long ago brought to light the failure of law enforcement agencies to send thousands of rape kits to be analyzed for DNA. That revelation ignited national outrage, prompted the passage of laws ordering the testing of rape kits and spurred the Justice Department to award more than $150 million to help analyze the backlog.\n\n\"Destroyed\" exposes a lesser-known and more fundamental problem:\n\nThe rape kits are gone. They can never be used to lock up a rapist or exonerate the wrongfully convicted.\n\nThis North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed.\n\n1. 'A systemic problem'\n\nA rape kit should be maintained for at least the length of time a crime can be prosecuted, experts told CNN.\n\nYet decisions about whether and when to destroy this evidence, CNN found, were made without considering the statutes of limitations.\n\nSome police departments defended the destruction of kits tied to closed cases that they believed had no chance of moving forward, such as when a prosecutor declined to bring a charge or when a victim who reported being raped stopped engaging with police.\n\nBut experts called that short-sighted.\n\nAnything can develop in a case while the statute of limitations is still running. New evidence can emerge or a victim may decide to work again with police, for example.\n\n\"What CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\" said retired Sergeant Joanne Archambault, who ran the San Diego Police Department's sex crimes unit for a decade.\n\n\"You're not serious about solving rape cases if you destroy rape kits before the statute of limitations [expires].\"\n\nArchambault was among the experts CNN asked to review cases that ended in kit destruction.\n\n\"There are mistakes in these cases,\" she said, \"but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\"\n\nRape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice.\n\n2. The destruction of kits is a tragedy as troubling as the backlog\n\nDetroit prosecutor Kym Worthy's office has fought to test the backlog of 10,000 unanalyzed kits in Wayne County, Michigan. That effort identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. Testing kits can not only solve crimes, it can prevent future ones by stopping would-be repeat perpetrators before they strike again.\n\nWorthy was stunned to hear that law enforcement agencies have destroyed rape kits -- most of them never analyzed.\n\n\"All the attention toward untested kits isn't enough if we have agencies destroying kits.\"\n\nShe isn't just a prosecutor. She's a survivor. Worthy was raped in law school, she said, and -- like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally -- she chose not to report her attack.\n\nIt's a triumph, she said, when a victim musters the courage to undergo an hours-long, invasive forensic examination with the hope that the DNA recovered will aid police in pursuing their assailant.\n\n\"Each one of these kits represents a victim,\" Worthy said. \"What you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\"\n\nExperts who examined case files for CNN found detectives improperly labeled cases \"unfounded\" \u2014 a term that means no crime occurred or was attempted.\n\n3. Destruction of rape kits followed poorly conducted investigations\n\nSeasoned police trainers, a former prosecutor, a DNA analyst and a trauma expert were among those who reviewed investigative case files in which kits were destroyed. They pointed to numerous flaws: kits were not tested, suspects were not interviewed, witnesses were not pursued. These experts taught CNN reporters, who reviewed more than 1,400 rape investigations, how to discern whether cases were conducted in a thorough and trauma-informed way.\n\nDetectives trained in how trauma affects victims know that withdrawal and avoidance are common symptoms. Best practice is to work at a pace set by the victim, connect the victim to advocacy services and offer, if needed, safety measures to protect a victim after a reported assault. It's critical to build rapport with a victim whose trust has been so severely violated, experts said. And that can only come by giving victims the time they need.\n\nBut that's not what CNN and experts saw in case after case.\n\nDetectives imposed arbitrary deadlines on victims and when they did not meet them, investigators closed cases, labeled victims \"uncooperative\" and relegated rape kits to evidence rooms until the evidence was trashed.\n\nA detective with the Springfield, Missouri, Police Department sent letters to victims, in some cases the day after they reported their assaults, warning that if they did not get in touch within 10 business days, their cases would not be investigated further.\n\n\"Victims have lost control of the most personal decision we make -- who we choose to be intimate with. They want some control back... When we send them a letter saying, 'Yeah, do this or else,'... (it) sounds very demanding, it sounds very much like what they may have experienced with the offender,\" said police trainer Tom Tremblay, a former sex crimes investigator who reviewed case files for CNN.\n\n4. The rape kits of the most vulnerable victims were destroyed\n\nIn the cases reviewed by CNN and Marci Hamilton, a law professor and attorney who is a nationally recognized expert on child sex crimes law, rape kits taken from minors who reported sexual abuse were destroyed by police while the alleged crimes could have still been prosecuted.\n\nTypically, the statute of limitations to prosecute a sex crime involving a victim who is a minor doesn't start ticking until the victim reaches legal adulthood.\n\n\"It takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\" Hamilton said. \"What police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\"\n\nCNN found that the rape kits of children and teenagers were among those discarded while the statutes of limitations were still running.\n\nCNN highlighted several cases that underscore Hamilton's outrage, including that of a 16-year-old who told police in Fayetteville, North Carolina, that her father raped her.\n\nA state crime lab notified the detective that it found the man's sperm in the teen's rape kit . But the investigator did not pursue the man. Instead, the detective wrote that he could not find the teenager, closed the case and then authorized the destruction of the girl's rape kit. Years later, police reopened the case and arrested the father without the evidence they said tied him to the crime. What followed was more anguish for the girl -- now a woman -- and another failure for the department.\n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, police trashed a 4-year-old's rape kit and the shorts she was wearing on the day of her alleged assault -- without ever testing that evidence. The girl's mother said she saw a wet spot on her daughter's shorts, and the child disclosed to a forensic interviewer that she was touched in her genital area by her uncle. Policing and legal experts who read the case file said it was possible the wet spot was bodily fluid left by the alleged abuser.\n\nWithout testing the shorts or rape kit evidence, police took their investigation to a prosecutor, who declined to file charges. The attorney explained her decision in writing: \"Unfortunately, no corroborating evidence.\"\n\nPolice ended the case and, two years later, in 2014, destroyed the girl's rape kit and shorts. Testing both might have provided corroborating evidence, experts said.\n\n5. Why this happened and how to start to fix it\n\nIt comes down to money, training and values. Departments said they didn't have enough of the first two. And experts said the third requires a commitment by agency leaders to examine their department's investigations and ask, \"How can we do better?\"\n\nCNN began reporting this project in 2016 after the police chief in Fayetteville, North Carolina, announced at a news conference that his department had regrettably destroyed 333 rape kits.\n\nThe officer who discovered the destruction, Lieutenant John Somerindyke, said detectives had the authority to approve disposal of rape kits in their cases and did so often after conducting poor investigations.\n\nLieutenant John Somerindyke: The head of the cold case unit in Fayetteville, North Carolina, spent two years reviewing old rape files. Many cases looked as though they could have been solved, but the rape kits were gone.\n\nThe agency failed victims because officers carried caseloads that were too large, he said, and the department lacked adequate resources. And, investigators were not trained to understand how victims behave after trauma.\n\nOther departments that destroyed rape kits echoed those complaints.\n\nOne answer, experts said, is more training at agencies nationwide on trauma and on the importance of testing and preserving rape kits.\n\nThey also said departments should regularly audit sex crimes investigations, and those audits should ideally be done by professionals outside the agency.\n\nFor now, that isn't happening. But there has long been at least one exception: The Philadelphia Police Department. It began annually reviewing its sex crimes investigations with the help of the Women's Law Project in 2000 after the Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that the police had mishandled rape cases.\n\n\"It's the essence of community policing,\" said attorney Carol Tracy, director of the Philadelphia Women's Law Project.\n\nTracy reviewed rape investigations for CNN and has consulted with departments across the country grappling with their backlog of untested rape kits.\n\n\"Kits being destroyed,\" she said. \"That is something I didn't realize was happening.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Drug overdoses, suicides cause drop in 2017 US life expectancy; CDC director calls it a 'wakeup call'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/0mSyXZ36eqU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Life expectancy in the United States declined from 2016 to 2017, yet the 10 leading causes of death remained the same, according to three government reports released Thursday. Increasing deaths due to drug overdoses and suicides explain this slight downtick in life expectancy, the US Centers for Disease Control says.\n\nOverdose deaths reached a new high in 2017, topping 70,000, while the suicide rate increased by 3.7%, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reports.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, CDC director, called the trend tragic and troubling. \"Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the Nation's overall health and these sobering statistics are a wakeup call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nGeneral US death rates\n\nThe estimate of how long a person born in 2017 can expect to live in the United States is 78.6 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2016, the government statisticians say.\n\nAs usual, women will continue to outlive men. In both 2016 and 2017, female life expectancy was 81.1 years, while male life expectancy dropped from 76.2 years in 2016 to 76.1 in 2017.\n\nThe number of resident deaths recorded in the nation totaled more than 2.8 million in 2017, about 69,000 more than in 2016, the report shows. Naturally, this increase affects the overall death rate, which is annually adjusted to account for the changing age of the general population. The rate increased from nearly 729 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016 to nearly 732 deaths in 2017 -- a rise of 0.4%.\n\nMost races and ethnic groups, including black males, Hispanic males and Hispanic females, saw no significant changes in their death rate year over year.\n\nHowever, black females experienced a 0.8% decreasing death rate in 2017 over the previous year, meaning they lived a bit longer, while the rate increased by 0.6% for white males and by 0.9% for white females.\n\nFinally, the 10 leading causes of death in 2017, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all deaths across the nation, were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease and suicide. This grim \"top 10 list\" remained unchanged from the previous year.\n\nDrug overdose deaths\n\nDrug overdose deaths among US residents totaled 70,237 in 2017, nearly 6,600 more than in 2016, a second government report finds. The rate increased from about 6 overdose deaths per 100,000 people in 1999 to nearly 22 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nRates have been consistently and significantly higher for males than females throughout the years, increasing from about 8 men dying of an overdose per 100,000 in 1999 to about 29 men per 100,000 in 2017. Among women, the rate increased from about 4 overdose deaths per 100,000 in 1999 to about 14 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nAge was an influencing factor in these deaths, the researchers found. Adults between 25 and 54 experienced the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in 2017. The 25-to-34 group had nearly 38 overdose deaths per 100,000, the 35-to-44 group had 39 per 100,000, and the 45-to-54 group had about 38 per 100,000.\n\nYounger and older people died by overdose less frequently, the report indicates. People between the ages of 15 and 24 experienced about 13 overdose deaths per 100,000, those between 55 and 64 experienced 28 per 100,000, and the 65 and older age group had about 7 deaths per 100,000.\n\nOverall, the greatest increase in drug overdose death rates was among adults between 55 and 64 for the period 1999 to 2017: About 4 deaths per 100,000 occurred in this group in 1999, compared with 28 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nPlace also mattered when it came to drug overdose deaths, with some states registering higher numbers than others, the report shows. The 2017 rate in West Virginia was nearly 58 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, in Ohio about 46 per 100,000, in Pennsylvania about 44 per 100,000, and in the District of Columbia, 44 per 100,000. Meanwhile, Texas (about 10 drug overdose deaths per 100,000), North Dakota (about 9 per 100,000), South Dakota and Nebraska (both about 8 per 100,000) had the lowest rates in 2017.\n\nThe heroin overdose death rate remained constant at about 5 deaths per 100,000 people for both 2016 and 2017; that said, it is seven times higher than in 1999. By contrast, overdose deaths involving fentanyl, fentanyl analogs and other synthetic opioids (other than methadone) increased by 45% between 2016 and 2017, rising from about 6 deaths per 100,000 to 9 per 100,000.\n\nDeaths by suicide\n\nOver the past decade, suicide has ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, a third new final government report reveals. Though constant, the rate has increased over time from about 10 suicides per 100,000 in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2017. And female suicides increased at a higher rate than male suicides during this period, though more men than women die by suicide each year.\n\nAmong males, the rate increased 26% between 1999 and 2017, from about 18 suicides per 100,000 to nearly 22 per 100,000.\n\nAmong females, the rate increased 53% from 4 suicides per 100,000 in 1999 to nearly 6 per 100,000 in 2017. Women between the ages of 45 and 64 experienced the highest rates in both 1999 (6 suicides per 100,000) and 2017 (nearly 10 suicides per 100,000).\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nRates in rural US counties are nearly twice as high as in urban counties, the government statisticians say.\n\nIn 1999, the suicide rate for the most rural counties was about 13 per 100,000, compared with nearly 10 per 100,000 in the most urban counties.\n\nIn 2017, the suicide rate for the most rural counties (20 per 100,000) outpaced that in the most urban counties (about 11 per 100,000). However, this 2017 urban suicide rate is 16% higher than in 1999 (about 10 per 100,000), while the 2017 suicide rate for the most rural counties is 53% higher than in 1999 (about 13 per 100,000), the report indicates.\n\n\"We must all work together to reverse this trend and help ensure that all Americans live longer and healthier,\" Redfield said in his statement, of the decline in life expectancy.

He says his wife drives 20 miles each direction to do laundry in a town with clear water.\n\nConcerned about the potential health effects for his family, including his two daughters, he ran for a seat on the local water board.\n\nWhat drives him, Tiser said, is \"being sure that they're not consuming anything that 20 years from now is going to wind up hurting them.\"\n\nYears of water system neglect means that the 250-or-so residents there are left with pipes that leak more than 70% of their water into the ground, Tiser said -- all because they can't afford to fix them.\n\n\"We're basically putting Band-Aids when we need to go to the ER. That's where we're at,\" he said.\n\nIt's what Edwards calls America's \"dirty little secret.\" He explains it this way: That often times towns like Enterprise are stuck with aging infrastructure that they can't fix, leaving few options for them to deal with complaints about dirty or contaminated water.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency says the nation needs $743 billion to fix America's water system.\n\nIn his wife's minivan, complete with acid stains on the carpet, Edwards says he makes long drives to small towns that are hurt by dwindling populations, and slowly being forgotten. \"It's the perfect vehicle. I couldn't take a rental car, because I can't explain why there's acid burns in the seats of those. But that van's seen a lot of bad water,\" he said.\n\nEdwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state, and local governments on water quality. His work helped to reveal high levels of lead in the water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nEdwards says Virginia Tech, where he is a professor, supports his work, as long as he can afford to pay for his travel, which he has done for years.\n\nPhotos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Enterprise, Louisiana, resident Jodie Vinson holds a bottle of water from her tap Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Virginia Tech Professor Marc Edwards, left, samples Enterprise's water, which was found to have bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.

But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right? We're all neighbors we all know each other it's the human, right thing to do.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "China suspends scientists who claim to have produced first gene-edited babies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/oYwgqXsbD7Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Hong Kong (CNN) China has suspended the research activities of the scientists who claimed to have created the world's first gene-edited babies, state-run Xinhua news reported Thursday.\n\nThe moves comes after Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced Monday that two ostensibly healthy twin girls had been born this month from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV.\n\nChinese authorities called He's claim \"extremely abominable in nature\" and a violation of Chinese law, according to Xinhua\n\n\"The gene-edited twins matter reported by the media has brazenly violated Chinese laws and regulations and breached the science ethics bottom line, which is both shocking and unacceptable,\" said Xu Nanping, vice minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Xinhua reported.\n\nHe, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, claims to have used a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR-cas9, which can insert or deactivate certain genes.

\"a non-Brexit Brexit\".\n\nMrs May has been trying to gather support for the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU, ahead of a Commons vote on 11 December - but it is widely expected that MPs will reject it.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on her flight to Buenos Aires, Mrs May insisted she had not given up hope of winning the vote, but said if MPs failed to back her it would mean \"division and uncertainty\" for Britain.\n\n\"Let's focus on the deal that we have negotiated with the EU, a deal which is good for the UK and good for their constituents,\" she said.\n\nMrs May said people she had met outside Westminster in the last few days had given her an \"overwhelming\" sense that they wanted MPs to back her deal.\n\nShe also rejected the idea of moving to a Norway-style

The trust was previously rated as \"requires improvement\" overall.\n\nThe trust is currently being investigated over alleged maternity failings, with more than 200 families raising concerns about care at the trust.\n\nIt recently abandoned a plan to close Telford's A&E department at night because of a shortage of doctors, drafting in extra staff instead.\n\nInspectors also said as well as the bullying and harassment claims they \"found a culture of defensiveness from the executive team\".\n\nImage caption Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was placed in special measures earlier this month\n\nThe report said staff felt they were not listened to and were sometimes fearful to raise concerns or issues, there was low morale among staff and high levels of stress and work overload.\n\nA former nurse previously told the BBC of a \"bullying, intimidatory culture\" at the trust, with junior staff frightened to raise concerns or questions for fear of being labelled troublemakers.\n\nInspectors also found:\n\nMedical care, surgery, critical care, end of life at both sites require improvement\n\nMedical and nurse staffing \"was not adequate to keep patients safe\" particularly at Telford\n\nStaff did not feel valued, supported or appreciated by senior staff\n\nThe CQC's report said inspectors were \"particularly concerned\" about the trust's emergency department and maternity services.\n\nA temporary midwife-led unit at Shrewsbury being used after its original building was damaged by snowfall last December was deemed \"unfit for purpose\" with senior staff \"crisis-managing\".\n\nThere has also been a shortage of midwives due to sickness and maternity leave, inspectors found.\n\nImage copyright Telford and Wrekin Council Image caption People have protested over plans to close the A&E department at The Princess Royal at night\n\nThe CQC has given the trust a raft of improvements to make, listing 81 issues that needed to be tackled, including ensuring staff are trained to protect patients from harm, and reviewing midwife staffing levels to keep women and babies safe.\n\nIt said the trust should also improve how it escalates cases of women at high risk at the midwifery-led unit or day assessment unit and review its policy on reduced foetal movements for midwives and sonographers.\n\nOther required improvements covered the maintenance of safe environments, speeding up complaints handling, the secure storage of medicines and records and the administering of antibiotics for patients with suspected sepsis.\n\nHowever, inspectors rated the trust as \"good\" for being caring and said they did find \"examples of outstanding practice in end of life care services at both sites\" as well as in its postnatal maternity care.\n\nThe trust said some of the CQC concerns had been addressed through recruitment and improved reporting by its maternity services.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent\n\nThis damning report will be an awful read for the families who have lost babies as a result of errors by this trust.\n\nSpeak to any of them, and their fervent wish is that nobody has to go through the same experience as they did.\n\nThe continuing inability of the trust, therefore, to ensure heart rates are properly monitored and the failure to learn lessons after incidents, smacks of a callous arrogance towards those families.\n\nFundamentally this is a trust that has been badly led for years.\n\nToday's report is stark in its denunciation of the current management - not all of them have the \"right skills and abilities\" to provide \"high-quality sustainable care\".\n\nChief executive Simon Wright insists he is not out of his depth, but under his watch the trust has demonstrably deteriorated.\n\nThe recently appointed chairman said on Wednesday that they \"can't carry on doing the same things with the same people\".\n\nThe growing chorus in Shropshire for Mr Wright to resign will certainly hope so.\n\nProf Ted Baker, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: \"While we found staff to be caring and dedicated, there is clearly much work needed at the trust to ensure care is delivered in a way that ensures people are safe.\n\n\"We remain particularly concerned about the emergency department and maternity services at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.\n\n\"We have already taken urgent action to protect people and we are monitoring the trust extremely closely.\"\n\nChief executive Mr Wright apologised and said the trust was \"disappointed that we have not made as much progress to tackle the issues and challenges that the Trust faces as we all want\".\n\n\"But people should not lose sight of many things that SaTH does not just well but significantly better than many other trusts around the country.\"\n\nAn independent review into a series of baby deaths at the trust was commissioned by the government last year.\n\nPreviously, an estimated 3,000 people marched in protest over SaTH's plan to close A&E at The Princess Royal at night, with the trust citing staff shortages for its decision."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health",

now give local farmers that pest infestations are on their way so they can take precautions\n\nUK researchers have developed an early warning system to prevent the crops of African farmers from being devastated.\n\nThe Pest Risk Information Service (Prise) combines temperature data and weather forecasts with computer models.\n\nIt then sends farmers a mobile phone alert so that they can take precautions.\n\nIt is hoped that the system will boost yields and increase farm incomes by up to 20%.\n\nPrise is being used in Kenya, Ghana and Zambia and will be rolled out soon in other parts of the world.\n\nPrise is an upgrade of a highly successful UK Aid scheme run by the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International development charity (CABI). It uses a network of so called \"plant doctors\" and clinics to advise farmers when pests or diseases destroy their crops.\n\nImage copyright GABI Image caption Farmers and plant doctors have access to an app to help them diagnose pest infestations and suggest remedies\n\nThe \"doctors\" draw on a database using an an app to help them to diagnose the issue and then prescribe the right pesticide and other measures. Walter Wafula, who grows Maize in Bungoma in Kenya, told BBC News that the service had transformed his family's lives.\n\n\"Because of the increased income from my farm, my kids can now go to a better school and the life at home has improved because I can provide the basic needs for my family,\" he said.\n\nSo far, the scheme has helped 18.3 million farmers, in 34 countries across Africa, Asia and the Americas. On average farm incomes and yields are 13% higher for those using the service.\n\nImage copyright Stephen Kill FBIPP BSc Image caption The data for the Prise system will be processed by the JASMIN supercomputer data cluster in Oxfordshire\n\nBut Prof Charlotte Watts, chief scientific adviser for the UK's Department for International Development, which funds the plant doctor scheme, says a new initiative with CABI and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) will use the network to prevent, rather than just mitigate infestations.\n\nShe says the idea is to use satellite data collected by the UKSA to develop a system that is able to predict when pest infestations will strike a week or more in advance.\n\nSatellites can provide accurate land temperature information, which is one of the most important drivers of pest infestations. This, combined with weather data and computer models, can be used to give farmers enough time to spray pesticide and take other precautions.\n\nCABI worked with the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council, to develop the project. Prof Watts told BBC News that the early indications are that the system is working.\n\n\"Farmers are completely dependent on crops and the predictability of having a good yield to survive and also to send their kids to school,\" she said.\n\n\"So if we can reduce the impact of pests, if we can enable them to get better yields - which we are already seeing - it will mean that we can help them move out of poverty.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Extinction crisis: Five things you should know", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46385691", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:00:54", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the last remaining rhinos of its kind\n\nThe world's in the midst of an extinction crisis, with plants and animals being lost at a rate not seen since the demise of the dinosaurs.

Earlier this year, BBC Hindi's Vineet Khare visited the area and details what he witnessed there.\n\nThe route to the Carmichael mine is a long lonely ride in the wilderness - a paved road transforms into a wide dirt track before you eventually reach the remote piece of land which has so divided Australia.\n\nThe $12.5bn (\u00a39.8bn) Carmichael project coal site in Queensland state is nearly 400km (248 miles) inland from the eastern coast. It's in the Mackay region, which is home to other mining projects.\n\nThe project has been delayed for six years because of a series of legal challenges and reports evaluating its environmental impact. It's owned by the Adani group, whose chairman, Gautam Adani, is considered to be close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe controversy over the project has seen Australian banks rule out funding and earlier this month, the firm said it had scaled down production, cutting its targets by three quarters. On Thursday, CEO Lucas Dow said that the firm itself would finance the project.\n\nBut, according to media reports, there are regulatory approvals pending, without which construction cannot begin.\n\nAs we travel to the mine, everyone along the way - from taxi drivers to restaurant owners and pedestrians - seems to have an opinion about the project.\n\nThose who oppose it, including climate scientists, say that if the mines are opened up, the world \"better bid goodbye to the Paris Agreement commitment to hold temperature rise to 2C\".\n\nBut supporters say it's good for the economy and accuse protesters of being \"deep-pocketed left-wing activists hell-bent on feeding lies.\"\n\nA 'secret' camp\n\nWe decide to first visit a \"secret anti-Adani camp\", located an hour's drive and a narrow path off the main route.\n\nThe wooden gate is electronically locked \"to keep away pro-Adani elements\".

Chargers, plug points and documents are all dumped on a table surrounded by men and women typing away on laptops. A WiFi connection links them to the world.\n\n\"This camp is a frontline to stop Adani. It's a place to organise and plan direct action,\" says one of the protesters, Scott Daynes.\n\n\"Science tells us that coal needs to stay in the ground, that's why we are here,\" he adds.\n\nThere is excitement that a journalist from India has come to cover the story. \"How much are these protests against Adani in Australia being covered by Indian media?\" one man asks.\n\n\"We hear Mr Adani is very influential and close to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Is it true?\" another asks.\n\nBoth Mr Adani and Mr Modi come from the western state of Gujarat and their relationship goes back to when Mr Modi was the state's chief minister.\n\nThe fact that Mr Modi used a plane chartered by the Adani group to fly to Delhi after he was elected prime minister is still cited as an example of their closeness.\n\nAs far back as 2003, Mr Adani broke ranks with fellow industrialists to form a separate business lobby group. This was after they had criticised Mr Modi for the poor law and order situation in Gujarat following the 2002 riots that killed more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.\n\nAnd when Mr Modi was dropped as the keynote speaker at Wharton Business School after protests by sections of students and the faculty, the Adani group withdrew its sponsorship.\n\nThe rise in the firm's fortunes ever since Mr Modi became prime minister has been the subject of constant media and opposition scrutiny in India.\n\nAnd the fate of the Australian project is being closely watched in India, especially with the federal elections just a few months away and the possibility of another five-year term for Mr Modi.\n\nImage caption The vehicle followed the BBC crew near the mine\n\nA mysterious vehicle\n\nNext, we decide to visit the proposed site of the mine.\n\nAs we approach, we spot a vehicle following us, its headlights flashing through the dust kicked up by our pick-up jeep.\n\nIt waits as we stop to speak to some farmers who have given up their land for a nearly 400km rail line that will be used to transport the coal once the mines are operational.\n\nActivists fear that, once constructed, the rail line will revive adjoining coal projects that are currently dormant due to a lack of transport options.\n\nBut the farmers refuse to speak to us citing a confidentiality agreement.\n\nThe vehicle continues to trail us for nearly an hour.\n\nAfter we reach the site, the driver, a well-built man, films us as we walk around it.

Their grins were tight-lipped, mirthless. Her sister had posted the picture on a social media account along with a caption punctuated by a smiley-face.\n\n\"Look, I have a Han Chinese mother now!\" his sister wrote.\n\nIdris knew instantly: The old woman was a spy, sent by the Chinese government to infiltrate his family.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThere are many like her. According to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, as of the end of September, 1.1 million local government workers have been deployed to ethnic minorities' living rooms, dining areas and Muslim prayer spaces, not to mention at weddings, funerals and other occasions once considered intimate and private.\n\nAll this is taking place in China's far west region of Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have long reported discrimination at the hands of the country's majority Han Chinese.\n\nWhile government notices about the \"Pair Up and Become Family\" programme portray it as an affectionate cultural exchange, Uighurs living in exile in Turkey said their loved ones saw the campaign as a chilling intrusion into the only place that they once felt safe.\n\nThey believe the programme is aimed at coercing Uighurs into living secular lives like the Han majority. Anything diverging from the party's prescribed lifestyle can be viewed by authorities as a sign of potential \"extremism\" - from suddenly giving up smoking or alcohol, to having an \"abnormal\" beard or an overly religious name.\n\nUnder Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillance, from armed checkpoints on street corners to facial-recognition-equipped CCTV cameras steadily surveying passers-by. Now, Uighurs say, they must live under the watchful eye of the ruling Communist Party even inside their own homes.\n\n\"The government is trying to destroy that last protected space in which Uighurs have been able to maintain their identity,\" said Joanne Smith Finley, an ethnographer at England's Newcastle University.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to five Uighurs living in Istanbul who shared the experiences of their family members in Xinjiang who have had to host Han Chinese civil servants. These accounts are based on prior communications with their family members, the majority of whom have since cut off contact because Uighurs can be punished for speaking to people abroad.\n\nThe Uighurs abroad said their loved ones were constantly on edge in their own homes, knowing that any misstep - a misplaced Quran, a carelessly spoken word - could lead to detention or worse. In the presence of these faux relatives, their family members could not pray or wear religious garbs, and the cadres were privy to their every move.\n\nThe thought of it - and the sight of his sister, the old woman and their false smiles - made Idris queasy.\n\n\"I wanted to throw up,\" said the 49-year-old petroleum engineer, shaking his head in disgust.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"The moment I saw the old woman, I thought, 'Ugh, this person is our enemy.' If your enemy became your mother, think about it - how would you feel?\"\n\nIndoctrination camps\n\nTensions between Muslim minorities and Han Chinese have bubbled over in recent years, resulting in violent attacks pegged to Uighur separatists and a fierce government crackdown on broadly defined \"extremism\" that has placed as many as 1 million Muslims in internment camps, according to estimates by experts and a human rights group.\n\nUighurs say the omnipresent threat of being sent to one of these centres, which are described as political indoctrination camps by former detainees, looms large in their relatives' minds when they are forced to welcome party members into their homes.\n\nLast December, Xinjiang authorities organised a \"Becoming Family Week\" which placed more than 1 million cadres in minority households. Government reports on the programme gushed about the warm \"family reunions,\" as public servants and Uighurs shared meals and even beds.\n\nAnother notice showed photos of visitors helping Uighur children with their homework and cooking meals for their \"families.\" The caption beneath a photo of three women lying in bed, clad in pajamas, said the cadre was \"sleeping with her relatives in their cozy room.\"\n\nA different photo showed two women \"studying the 19th Party Congress and walking together into the new era\" - a nod to when Xi's name was enshrined in the party constitution alongside the likes of Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong.\n\nBecoming Family Week turned out to be a test run for a standardised homestay programme. The Xinjiang United Front Work Department said in February that government workers should live with their assigned families every two months, for five days at a time.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThe United Front, a Communist Party agency, indicates in the notice that the programme is mandatory for cadres. Likewise, Idris and other interviewees said their families understood that they would be deemed \"extremists\" if they refused to take part.\n\nCadres, who are generally civilians working in the public sector, are directed to attend important family events such as the naming of newborns, circumcisions, weddings and funerals of close relatives. They must have a firm grasp of each family member's ideological state, social activities, religion, income, their challenges and needs, as well as basic details on immediate relatives, the notice said.\n\nFamilies were to be paid a daily rate of 20 to 50 yuan ($2.80 to $7.80) to cover the cost of meals shared with their newfound relatives. Some families might be paired with two or three cadres at a time, according to the notice, and the regularly mandated house calls could be supplanted with trips to the local party office.\n\nA February piece on the Communist Party's official news site said: \"The vast majority of party cadres are not only living inside villagers' homes, but also living inside the hearts of the masses.\"\n\nOverseas Uighurs said the \"visits\" to their relatives' homes often lasted longer than five days, and they were closely monitored the whole time. The cadres would ask their family members where they were going and who they were meeting whenever they wanted to leave the house.\n\n\"They couldn't pray,\" said Abduzahir Yunus, a 23-year-old Uighur originally from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. \"Praying or even having a Quran at home could endanger the whole family.\"\n\nYunus, who now lives in Istanbul, said his father used to lament to him about being visited three to four times a week by the administrator of his neighborhood committee, a middle-aged Han Chinese man. The surprise house calls began in 2016, and it was \"impossible to say no,\" Yunus said. They often coincided with times traditionally designated for prayer.\n\n\"Their aim is to assimilate us,\" Yunus said. \"They want us to eat like them, sleep like them and dress like them.\"\n\nAfter Yunus's parents and older brother were detained, only Yunus's sister-in-law and 5-year-old brother remained in the house. Around the beginning of 2018, the Han Chinese man started staying with them full-time.\n\nUighurs said they were particularly repulsed by the thought of male visitors living under the same roof as their female relatives and children - a practice contrary to their faith. Women and kids are sometimes the only ones left at home after male family members are sent to internment camps.\n\nIn recent years, the government has even encouraged Uighurs and Han Chinese to tie the knot.\n\nStarting in 2014, Han-Uighur spouses in one county were eligible to receive 10,000 yuan ($1,442) annually for up to five years following the registration of their marriage license.\n\nSuch marriages are highly publicized. The party committee in Luopu county celebrated the marriage of a Uighur woman and a \"young lad\" from Henan in an official social media account in October 2017. The man, Wang Linkai, had been recruited through a programme that brought university graduates to work in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.\n\n\"They will let ethnic unity forever bloom in their hearts,\" the party committee's post said. \"Let ethnic unity become one's own flesh and blood.\"\n\n'Becoming family'\n\nNot all \"Become Family\" pairings involve Han Chinese visitors. A Uighur cadre named Gu Li said she regularly pays visits to a Uighur household, staying three to five days at a time.\n\n\"We've already started calling each other family,\" she said in a telephone interview from Xinjiang. \"China's 56 ethnic groups are all one family.\"\n\nGu said civil servants of many ethnicities - Uighur, Han and Kazakh - participate in the programme.\n\nAll government employees in the region are required to conduct such visits in order to better understand villagers' needs, according to Gu: \"Because we're always sitting in our offices, we don't know what they really need. Only through penetrating the masses can we truly serve them.\"\n\nAs with many of the government's other initiatives in Xinjiang, the \"Pair Up and Become Family\" programme is presented as a way to rescue Muslim minorities from poverty. Public servants show up at homes bearing bags of rice and gallons of cooking oil, and their duties include helping with chores and farm work.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nXu Jing, an employee at Turpan city's environmental bureau, recounted her shock after entering her assigned relative's home. Xu said the only light in the residence came from a small window, and she realized that Xasiyet Hoshur wasn't lying when she said she lived on 3,000 yuan ($433) a year.\n\n\"But it's OK, everything is getting better,\" Xu wrote in her reflection, published on Turpan's government site. Hoshur's daughter was attending university on a 5,000 yuan ($722) national scholarship.\n\nOn the one hand, China maintains that employment and living standards are key to warding off the temptations of religious \"extremism\". On the other hand, official descriptions of the visitation and homestay programme are laden with suggestions that the ethnic minority families are uncivilized and that their way of life needs to be corrected.\n\nOne notice, first highlighted by University of Washington ethnographer Darren Byler, focused on a Uighur family's use of a raised, cloth-covered platform for eating and working. In traditional Uighur culture, this setup is preferable to a table, but the testimonial published by the Xinjiang Communist Youth League said frequent use of the platform was \"inconvenient\" and \"unhealthy.\"\n\nThe post quoted a cadre saying: \"Even though we already purchased a TV and rice oil for our relatives, after living with our relatives for a few days, we still insisted on using our own money to buy our relatives a table and lamp.\"\n\nIn the People's Daily, a Uighur baker in Kashgar named Ablimit Ablipiz was quoted praising the party for improving his habits. \"Ever since these cadres started living in my home, we've picked up a lot of know-how about food safety and hygiene,\" Ablipiz said.\n\nUighurs must also conform culturally. Over the Lunar New Year, an important Chinese holiday not traditionally celebrated by Uighurs, cadres encouraged households to hang lanterns and sing \"red songs,\" ballads honoring the party's revolutionary history. Byler said families could not ask whether the meat was halal and acceptable to Muslims when they had to make or eat dumplings for the festival.\n\nStuck in China\n\nThousands of miles away, in Turkey, Uighur relatives in exile watch what is happening with dread.\n\nEarlier this year, Ablikim Abliz studied a photo of his uncle's family gathered around a table. Clad in thick winter jackets, his uncle and the smiling Han Chinese man beside him both held chubby-faced children in their laps.\n\nHis uncle had posted the photo to his WeChat page along with the caption \"Han Chinese brother.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old Abliz said his entire extended family in China has been sent to internment camps. When he saw his uncle's photo, his first reaction was relief. If his uncle had been assigned a Han family member, Abliz thought, that meant he was safe.\n\nBut the consolation was short-lived. A friend who tried to visit his uncle in Turpan this summer told Abliz that his uncle's front door was boarded up and sealed with police tape. Abliz has not been able to reach any of his family members since.\n\nAs for Idris, he fears that his sister is living under immense pressure with her Han Chinese \"mother.\" Shortly after her sister's first post about her new relatives, a friend responded on WeChat: \"I also have one! You guys better be careful!\"\n\nThe same friend later posted photos of herself and a Han Chinese woman doing a Chinese fan dance, playing the drums and wearing traditional Han clothing.\n\nHis sister would never have volunteered for such a programme, Idris said. She and his younger sister had been trying to get passports to bring their children to Turkey and reunite with Idris, but their applications were not accepted.\n\nLast summer, both of his sisters deleted him on WeChat. A few months later, his aunt deleted him, too. For more than a year, Idris has not been able to communicate with his relatives.

While the numbers are far from those from West Africa in 2014, we're witnessing how the dynamics of conflict pose a different kind of threat,\" said Michelle Gayer, senior director of emergency health at the International Rescue Committee.\n\nIn a major concern for health workers, many new cases have been unconnected to known infections as the insecurity complicates efforts to track contacts of those with the disease.\n\nThe alarmingly high number of infected newborns in this outbreak is another concern, and so far a mystery.\n\nIn a separate statement on Thursday, WHO said so far 36 Ebola cases have been reported among newborn babies and children under 2.\n\nAs the need for help in containing the outbreak grows, two of the world's most prominent medical journals this week published statements by global health experts urging the Trump administration to do more.\n\nIn the Journal of the American Medical Association, one group noted that the US government weeks ago ordered all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel - \"some of the world's most experienced outbreak experts\" - from DR Congo's outbreak zone because of security concerns.\n\nA separate statement published in the New England Journal of Medicine said: \"Given the worsening of the outbreak, we believe it's essential that these security concerns be addressed and that CDC staff return to the field.\"\n\nEbola is a serious infectious disease that can spread rapidly through small amounts of bodily fluid, causing internal bleeding and potentially death.\n\nDR Congo is in the throes of a major campaign ahead of a December 23 election to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled the vast central African country since 2001.\n\nSince winning independence from Belgium in 1960, this poverty-stricken nation has never known a peaceful transition of power."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "G20 Summit 2018: All the latest updates", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/g20-summit-2018-latest-updates-181126191302549.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Nineteen leaders of the world's biggest economies and a representative of the European Union are set to meet on Friday and Saturday in Buenos Aries, Argentina as part of the Group of 20 summit.\n\nThis year, all eyes will be on a range of issues, including a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and the potential signing of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's appearance at the summit is expected to cause some protests over the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nOther demonstrations are also expected in the lead-up to the annual meeting.\n\nHere are all the latest updates:\n\nFriday, November 30\n\nSaudi crown prince meets India's Modi in Argentina\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed cooperation between the two countries in security, energy and investments, the Saudi press agency said.\n\nThe two leaders, who met in the prince's residence in Buenos Aires, also discussed Saudi Arabia's readiness to supply India with all its needs of oil and petroleum products and Saudi oil giant Aramco's investments in the fields of oil refining and oil storage in India, it said.\n\nThe crown prince and Modi also agreed on investing in solar energy, it added.\n\nUK PM May to speak to Saudi crown prince on Khashoggi, Yemen\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May plans to raise the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and the situation in Yemen with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nThe killing of the Washington Post columnist, a critic of the crown prince, has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed's image abroad.

Berlin on Thursday, Merkel said the situation could only be resolved through \"talks\" as there was \"no military solution\".\n\n\"I'm for putting the facts of what we know so far on the table and

judge seeks help from Turkey, Yemen in Saudi crown prince case\n\nAn Argentine judge reviewing a complaint by Human Rights Watch (HRW) against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his involvement in the war in Yemen asked Argentine's foreign ministry to seek Turkey and the International Criminal Court for information, the judge's office told Reuters news agency.\n\nOn Monday, HRW asked the judge to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate any involvement by the crown prince in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen and Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe office of federal judge Ariel Lijo said on Wednesday it was seeking information on any open cases relating to the murder of Khashoggi or war crimes in Yemen.\n\nA representative of the federal

said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Of course, they will talk about this subject,\" Ushakov said, referring to the Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\n\nHowever, he said the \"main aim\" of the meeting will be \"the development\" of Russian-Saudi relations.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Putin praised top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed personally for his role in agreeing to \"balance supply and demand\" in crude production.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of this organisation (OPEC) that we have succeeded 100 percent in doing this,\" Putin told attendees at an investment forum in Moscow.\n\n\n\n\"I must admit that this is largely thanks to the position of Saudi Arabia. This is essentially down to Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince,\" the Russian leader said.\n\nIMF chief warns trade tensions could hurt global economy\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Chairwoman Christine Lagarde has warned world leaders escalating trade tensions, including car tariffs and Brexit, could hurt the global economy.\n\nIn a report for the G20 leaders meeting in Buenos Aires, the IMF said car tariffs, if imposed, could cut 0.75 percent off the global economy.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on autos as part of his aggressive trade strategy focused on preserving US jobs.\n\nHe has hit half of US imports from China with steep punitive tariffs, which has drawn retaliation from Beijing.\n\n\n\nEmerging market economies, especially China and the euro area, are already seeing their economies slow, while a \"no-deal Brexit could further dent confidence\", Lagarde said in a blog post that accompanied the report.\n\nLagarde warned the upcoming G20 gathering that \"the global economy faces a critical juncture\".\n\n\n\n\"We have had a good stretch of solid growth by historical standards, but now we are facing a period where significant risks are materializing and darker clouds are looming,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Rising trade barriers are ultimately self-defeating for all involved. Thus, it is imperative that all countries steer clear of new trade barriers, while reversing recent tariffs,\" she stressed.\n\nSaudi crown prince arrives in Argentina\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman landed in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit, according to Argentine TV news.\n\nHis arrival comes amid international furore over the murder of Khashoggi and a request by Human Rights Watch that Argentina investigate him for war crimes in Yemen.\n\nAP Analysis: Will MBS be a pariah at G20?\n\nAll eyes will be on Prince Mohammed, particularly over the killing of Khashoggi. There have been allegations that he ordered the killing, which happened inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. There will be leaders who won't want to get caught in a grip-and-grin situation with MBS.\n\nIt's a photo opportunity that could cause serious ripples, even disgust, and have concrete repercussions at home by appearing to exonerate or legitimise the man US intelligence agencies concluded ordered the killing.\n\nThat won't be a problem for US President Donald Trump, who drew bipartisan ire in the US Congress for effectively giving the prince a free pass in the name of \"America First\", based on the president's vastly exaggerated claims of Saudi military contracts and investments in the US.\n\nIt may well be that Trump will go out of his way to embrace the de facto Saudi leader as others scurry away, treating him as a pariah.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has kept international pressure mounting on Saudi Arabia, is also expected to attend. The crown prince has requested a meeting with Erdogan on the sidelines of the summit, according to Ankara.\n\nMBS leaves Tunisia to Argentina to attend G20: report\n\nEarlier in the day, Reuters news agency reported that Prince Mohammad left Tunisia for Argentina to attend the G20 summit, where all eyes will be on world leaders' reaction to the man accused of ordering Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe prince left Tunisia early on Wednesday, Reuters quoted Al-Arabiya's website as saying.\n\nThe crown prince's G20 attendance is a bold effort to force the issue of whether world leaders will work with Saudi Arabia, analysts say. Riyadh is also indicating with his appearance in Buenos Aires that Prince Mohammed is back in the saddle and the worst of the controversy is over.\n\nHuman Rights Watch requested that Argentine authorities arrest the crown prince and that he be tried by a court for war crimes in Yemen and Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTuesday, November 27\n\nTrump: I may cancel Putin meeting at G20 over Ukraine conflict\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he may cancel his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Argentina because of Russia's maritime clash with Ukraine.\n\n\"Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting ... I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,\" Trump told the Washington Post in an interview.\n\nWhite House adviser says China-US trade deal still possible\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday that Trump will have a dinner meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G20 gathering in Argentina and also held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal.\n\n\"There is a good possibility that we can make a deal and he is open to it,\" Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, told a press briefing, referring to Trump.\n\nNo plans for Trump-MBS meet at G20: Bolton\n\nUS National Security Adviser John Bolton said President Donald Trump had no plans to meet Saudi Crown Prince Prince Mohammed at this week's G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that while no meetings are planned, she could not rule out any interaction between Trump and Prince Salman.\n\nTrump will meet leaders of Russia, Japan, Germany, Argentina at G20\n\nPresident Trump will have bilateral meetings with the leaders of Argentina, Russia, Japan and Germany when he and the American delegation go to Argentina for the Group of 20 summit later this week, a White House spokeswoman said on Tuesday.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet separately with China's Xi Jinping for the first time since the world's two largest economies imposed tariffs on each other's imports.\n\nNo plans for a Trump-May meeting at G20\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has no specific plans for a bilateral meeting with Trump at the G20 meeting later this week, her spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Trump stoked concerns among some of May's legislators about her Brexit deal by saying he thought it was good for the EU and may make trade between Washington and London more difficult.\n\nMay's office disputed that, saying it would allow Britain to sign trade deals with countries throughout the world.\n\nMonday, November 26\n\nTrump says he expects to raise China tariffs: WSJ\n\nTrump said on Monday he expects to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200bnin Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said it was \"highly unlikely\" he would accept China's request to hold off on the increase.\n\nTrump, who is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires this week, said if negotiations are unsuccessful he would also put tariffs on the rest of Chinese imports.\n\nPrince Mohammed arrived in Egypt on Monday, the third leg of his first trip abroad since the murder of journalist Khashoggi in Turkey last month.\n\nPrince Mohammed is expected to travel to Tunisia after his two-day visit to Egypt before heading for a G20 meeting in Buenos Aires.\n\nLast week, Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver, said all eyes will be on MBS as world leaders gather for the G20 meeting from November 30 to December 1 in Argentina\n\nHashemi noted the Argentina trip puts Prince Mohammed in possible legal jeopardy under the policy of universal jurisdiction under international law.\n\n\"If there is a case brought against the Saudi crown prince for war crimes or murder by another court that is considered to be credible then an indictment can be issued against him when he arrives in Buenos Aires. So, I suspect this is something his lawyers and advisors are looking into,\" Hashemi told Al Jazeera."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:08", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US, China Eye G-20 for Relationship Reset", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-eye-g20-for-relationship-reset/4680915.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Expectations are building over whether U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping can reach a deal to defuse tensions over trade disputes and security issues when the two meet during the G-20 summit later this week in Argentina.

Farr is nominated to serve as a district court judge in North Carolina.\n\nScott announced Thursday that he would not vote for Farr, joining Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and 49 Democratic lawmakers in opposing the nominee.\n\nFormer Helms campaign lawyer\n\nFarr once served as a lawyer for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in 1990. The Justice Department alleged that about 120,000 postcards sent mostly to black voters before that election was intended to intimidate them from voting.\n\nThe postcards targeting black voters said they could be prosecuted and imprisoned for up to five years if they tried to vote in a precinct in which they had lived for fewer than 30 days.\n\nFarr told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was not consulted about the postcards and did not have any role in drafting or sending them. He said that after he had been asked to review the card, \u201cI was appalled to read the incorrect language printed on the card and to then discover it had been sent to African Americans.\u201d\n\nA 1991 Justice Department memo, first reported by The Washington Post, raised questions about Farr\u2019s claim that he was never consulted about the postcards. The memo said Farr had met with key campaign officials and had advised them \u201cthat a postcard mailing like the mailing conducted in 1984 would not be particularly useful\u201d except as evidence in post-election challenges.\n\nThe 1984 mailing contained an endorsement of Helms from a black minister and included an address correction request so the card would be returned if undelivered, setting up a potential avenue to challenge the legitimacy of a voter.\n\nMemo raises concerns\n\nScott, who is African-American, cited the memo as to why he would vote against Farr.\n\n\u201cThis week, a Department of Justice memo written under President George H.W. Bush came to light that shed new light on Mr. Farr\u2019s activities,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis, in turn, creates more concerns. Weighing these important factors, this afternoon I concluded that I could not support Mr. Farr\u2019s nomination.\u201d\n\nScott has supported the overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, but in July, the nomination of Ryan Bounds to serve on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was withdrawn after Scott said he \u201chad unanswered questions that led to me being unable to support him.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had repeatedly criticized Republicans in recent days for moving forward with the Farr vote. He said Scott \u201chas done a courageous thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Farr has been involved in the sordid practice of voter suppression for decades and never should have been nominated, let alone confirmed to the bench. Thankfully, he won\u2019t be,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nEarlier Thursday, senators had agreed to postpone the vote on Farr until next week. That decision came less than 24 hours after Republicans needed Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote Wednesday to move Farr\u2019s nomination forward for a final vote.\n\nLongest judicial opening\n\nThe history of the judicial opening has contributed to the acrimony. President Barack Obama nominated two African-American women to serve on the court, but neither got a hearing.\n\nRepublican Sens. Thom Tillis and Richard Burr of North Carolina both supported Farr\u2019s nomination. Tillis said earlier in the week he believed that Farr was being treated unfairly.\n\nScott is the lone black Republican in the Senate. The NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus had been highly critical of Farr for his work defending state laws they said suppressed the black vote.\n\nGOP leaders in charge of the North Carolina Legislature hired Farr and others at his firm to defend congressional and legislative boundaries that the legislature approved in 2011. A federal court eventually struck some boundaries down as racial gerrymanders and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision.\n\nFarr also helped defend a 2013 law that required photo identification to vote, reduced the number of early voting days and eliminated same-day registration during that period.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans said that requiring voter ID would increase the integrity of elections. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The Richmond, Virginia-based court said the law targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nFarr told lawmakers that, as an advocate, he vehemently disagreed with the argument that the state\u2019s legislature sought to curtail the voting rights of people of color or any other voter. But, said, \u201cI am obligated to follow the decision by the 4th Circuit and pledge that I will do so.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said Farr is \u201cfundamentally an honest, decent and honorable man, who did nothing to deserve the assault on his character.

They told a skeptical panel of judges in New York on Thursday that they have different legal issues, a need for faster relief because the babies need services in the first years of their lives. They also told the judges that as it is, they lack the leverage to exact a settlement from drug companies.\n\nBabies, unlike governments or businesses, have been directly harmed by the actions of drugmakers and are entitled to their own payments, said Scott Bickford, a lead lawyer for the children and their guardians.\n\nBickford said more than 150,000 babies were born in opioid withdrawal from 2012 through 2016, and that the number grows each year\n\nFederal cases consolidated\n\nHe said initial hospital stays for babies born to an opioid-addicted mother can cost $200,000 to $250,000 more than other infants born without complications.\n\n\u201cThen you have to address their developmental and learning problems,\u201d Bickford said in a Tuesday interview. \u201cA lot of them have organ problems. A lot of them have problems we don\u2019t even know about.\u201d\n\nDrug manufacturers and distributors oppose creating a new structure for the lawsuits over the children and judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation hearing the matter in New York on Thursday wondered what good it would do.\n\nOpioids \u2014 including prescription painkillers, heroin and synthetic substances including fentanyl \u2014 killed nearly 48,000 Americans last year, according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cost of treatment, providing an overdose antidote, foster care, jail stays, ambulance runs and addressing a growing homeless crisis have added up for governments and taxpayers. Studies have found that opioid addiction also has depleted the workforce, harming the economy.\n\nMore than 1,400 plaintiffs have had their federal cases consolidated under a single judge. They include county and local governments, hospitals, unions, American Indian tribes and individuals. Hundreds of others have sued in state courts. Cleveland-based federal Judge Dan Polster has been pushing the parties to reach a settlement.\n\nChildren need a voice\n\nThe judicial panel\u2019s chairwoman, Judge Sarah Vance, said it\u2019s unlikely any settlement would be reached without considering the children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see how the defendants are going to settle if they\u2019ve got 150,000 children unhappy because their needs are unmet,\u201d Vance said.\n\nAngela Vicari, a lawyer for the drug manufacturers, told the judge that she wasn\u2019t aware of the lawyers for the babies seeking to negotiate.\n\nBut lawyers for the children said they don\u2019t have a voice in the committee of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leading the case, making it hard to request the information from the industry that they believe would help prove their case. Attorney Kevin Thompson said it\u2019s essential to request information on any industry laboratory studies on the impact of drugs passed from mothers to children.\n\nLawyers also worry that any settlement reached by government agencies won\u2019t go to help the people who have been hurt. \u201cThey end up paving a road with that,\u201d Bickford said.\n\nOther plaintiffs in the omnibus opioid litigation have not objected formally and did not speak in court Thursday, but some are cool to the idea of separating the cases involving the children. One of the lead lawyers for the local governments, Paul Farrell Jr., said he is trying to get help for children born with opioid dependency and have prenatal care funded by the drug industry.\n\nHe said in an interview that the plaintiffs share a goal: holding drug manufacturers liable for the crisis. Unless that happens, he said, no one will get the payouts they\u2019re seeking.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only got to shoot the pig once,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nIndian tribes allowed to go it alone\n\nLawyers representing the children and their guardians say there is precedent for their request to go it alone, after Polster granted the American Indian tribes a separate test trial for their claims. In August, the judge denied similar status for the cases brought on behalf of babies.\n\nThat decision prompted the lawyers to ask the panel of judges to put their cases under another judge in West Virginia or Illinois.\n\nA ruling is expected in the next several weeks."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Repeat Outbreaks Pressure Produce Industry to Step Up Safety", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/repeat-outbreaks-pressure-produce-industry-to-step-up-safety/4680138.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "After repeated food poisoning outbreaks linked to romaine lettuce, the produce industry is confronting the failure of its own safety measures in preventing contaminations.\n\nThe E. coli outbreak announced just before Thanksgiving follows one in the spring that sickened more than 200 people and killed five, and another last year that sickened 25 and killed one.\n\nNo deaths have been reported in the latest outbreak, but the dozens of illnesses highlight the challenge of eliminating risk for vegetables grown in open fields and eaten raw, the role of nearby cattle operations that produce huge volumes of manure and the delay of stricter federal food safety regulations.\n\nA contested aspect of the regulation, for example, would require testing irrigation water for E. coli. The Food and Drug Administration put the measure on hold when the produce industry said such tests wouldn't necessarily help prevent outbreaks. Additional regulations on sanitation for workers and equipment \u2014 other potential sources of contamination \u2014 only recently started being implemented.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said he thinks the combination of rules, once fully in place, will make vegetables safer to eat.\n\n\"I don't think any one element of this is going to be the magic bullet,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nHealth officials say improved detection may make outbreaks seem more frequent. Still, that is intensifying pressure on growers and regulators to prevent, catch and contain contamination.\n\nPrevention\n\nIt's not yet known how romaine got contaminated in the latest outbreak.\n\nThe spring outbreak was traced to romaine from Yuma, Arizona. Irrigation water tainted with manure was identified as a likely culprit, and investigators noted the presence of a large animal feeding operation nearby.\n\nSubsequently, growers in Arizona and California adjusted an industry agreement to expand buffer zones between vegetable fields and livestock. The industry says the change was in place for lettuce now being grown in Yuma, which hasn't been implicated in the latest outbreak. But Trevor Suslow of the Produce Marketing Association said there isn't consensus about the exact distances that might effectively prevent contamination.\n\nHe noted specific buffer zones aren't required by the new federal rules on produce safety.\n\n\"They look to the industry to determine what is the appropriate distance,\" Suslow said.\n\nGrowers in Yuma also started treating irrigation water that would touch plant leaves with chlorine to kill potential contaminants, Suslow said. But he said such treatment raises concerns about soil and human health.\n\nMeanwhile, the proximity of produce fields to cattle operations is likely to continue posing a problem. Travis Forgues of the milk producer Organic Valley noted consolidation in the dairy industry is leading to bigger livestock operations that produce massive volumes of manure.\n\nTesting\n\nAlready, the industry agreement in Arizona and California requires leafy green growers to test water for generic E. coli.\n\nBut James Rogers, director of food safety research at Consumer Reports, said it's important to make water testing a federal requirement. Since romaine is often chopped up and bagged, a single contaminated batch from one farm that skips testing could make a lot of people sick, he said.\n\nTeressa Lopez of the Arizona Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement also said federal regulation can ensure greater compliance, even though the industry agreement has stricter measures.\n\nDespite industry measures implemented after a spinach outbreak more than a decade ago, health officials note d this month there have been 28 E. coli outbreaks linked to leafy greens since 2009.\n\nThe produce industry says the failure to prevent the Yuma outbreak could also reflect the limitations of testing water for generic E. coli.\n\nElizabeth Binh, a food science expert at Cornell University, said the tests look for the amount of fecal matter in water. The problem is, \"some feces has pathogens in it, some feces doesn't,\" said Binh, who is part of a federal program helping farmers comply with the new produce regulations.\n\nTesting for specific E. coli strains that are harmful is more difficult, and doesn't rule out the possibility of other harmful bacteria, Binh said.\n\nContainment\n\nWhole-genome sequencing is making it easier to detect outbreaks, which is pressuring the produce industry.\n\nThe FDA warned against all romaine last week because it said it was able to identify it as a likely source early enough. The agency narrowed its warning to romaine from California's Central Coast after the produce industry agreed to label romaine with harvest dates and regions, so people know what's OK to eat.\n\nThe labeling is voluntary, and the industry said it will evaluate whether to extend it to other leafy greens. Gottlieb said improving traceability would allow targeted health alerts that don't hurt the entire industry. The FDA recently hired a former Walmart executive who used blockchain technology to improve traceability in the retailer's supply chain.\n\nStephen Basore, director of food safety at a Florida romaine grower, said he expects more regulations and self-imposed industry guidelines.\n\n\"Anytime there is an issue, the immediate response is saying our protocols aren't enough,\" he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Rosenstein Calls for Tech Firms to Work With Law Enforcement", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/rosenstein-calls-for-tech-firms-to-work-with-law-enforcement-/4680801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called on social media companies and technology firms Thursday to work with law enforcement to protect the public from cybercriminals.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a symposium on online crime, Rosenstein said that \"social media platforms provide unprecedented opportunities for the free exchange of ideas.

Facebook launched the service in January with six cities and expanded that to 25, then more. On Wednesday, \u201cToday In\u201d is expanding to 400 cities in the U.S. \u2014 and a few others in Australia.\n\nThe move comes as Facebook tries to shake off its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and elections-meddling and rather a place for communities and people to come together and stay informed.\n\nHere are some things to know about this effort, and why it matters:\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt's something users have asked for, the company says. Think of it as an evolution of a \u201ctrending\u201d feature the company dropped earlier this year. That feature, which showed news articles that were popular among users, but was rife with such problems as fake news and accusations of bias.\n\nAnthea Watson Strong, product manager for local news and community information, said her team learned from the problems with that feature.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply the mistakes of our foremothers and forefathers,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time around, Facebook employees went to some of the cities they were launching in and met with users. They tried to predict problems by doing \u201cpre-mortem\u201d assessments, she said. That is, instead of a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d where engineers dissect what went wrong after the fact, they tried to anticipate how people might misuse a feature \u2014 for financial gain, for example.\n\nFacebook isn't saying how long it has been taking this \u201cpre-mortem\u201d approach, though the practice isn't unique to the company. Nonetheless, it's a significant step given that many of Facebook's current problems stem from its failure to foresee how bad actors might co-opt the service.\n\nFacebook also hopes the feature's slow rollout will prevent problems.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo find out if \u201cToday In\u201d is available in your city or town, tap the \u201cmenu\u201d icon with the three horizontal lines. Then scroll down until you see it. If you want, you can choose to see the local updates directly in your news feed.\n\nFor now, the company is offering this only in small and mid-sized cities such as Conroe, Texas, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Large cities such as New York or Los Angeles have added challenges, such as an abundance of news and information, and may need to be broken up into smaller neighborhoods.\n\nThe posts in \u201cToday In\u201d are curated by artificial intelligence; there is no human involvement. The service aggregates posts from the Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. For this reason, a kid couldn't declare a snow day, because \u201cToday In\u201d relies on the school's official page. Discussion posts from local Facebook groups may also be included.\n\nFor now, the information is tailored only by geography, but this might change. A person with no kids, for example, might not want to see updates from schools.\n\nSafeguards?\n\n\n\nFacebook uses software filters to weed out objectionable content, just as it does on people's regular news feed. But the filters are turned up for \u201cToday In.\u201d If a good friend posts something a bit objectionable, you are still likely to see it because Facebook takes your friendship into account. But \u201cToday In\u201d posts aren't coming from your friends, so Facebook is more likely to keep it out.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Porsche Shows off New Edition of Mainstay 911 Sports Car", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/porsche-shows-off-new-edition-of-mainstay-911-sports-car/4678158.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Porsche says its future is in electric cars but for now it is rolling out a more powerful version of its internal combustion mainstay, the sleek 911 sports car.\n\nStuttgart-based Porsche, part of Volkswagen, is to show off the eighth version of its brand-defining model at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\n\n\nThe new 911 doesn't look much different than earlier editions of the car.

Once used primarily against individuals, ransomware has been increasingly employed in cyberattacks on businesses.\n\nFaramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, are accused of creating the SamSam Ransomware in December 2015 and installing it on the computer networks of more than 230 public and private entities in the United States and Canada, according to a 26-page indictment unsealed Wednesday.\n\nWith the targeted computer users unable to access their data, Savandi and Mansouri, operating out of Iran, would then demand a ransom payment made in the form of the virtual currency bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys for the encrypted data.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the two Iranians received more than $6 million in cryptocurrencies from their victims which they converted into Iranian currency, or rial, using Iran-based bitcoin exchanges. About half of the infiltrated entities refused to make a ransom payment and suffered over $30 million in lost data, according to the indictment.\n\nThe victims included the cities of Atlanta, Newark and San Diego, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the University of Calgary in Calgary, Canada, and six U.S. public health care-related entities.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the six-count indictment at a press conference in Washington.\n\n\"Every sector of our economy is a target of malicious cyberactivity,\" Rosenstein said. \"But the events described in this indictment highlight the urgent need for municipalities, public utilities, health care institutions, universities, and other public organizations to enhance their cybersecurity.\"\n\nThe two indicted Iranians remain at large and have been placed on the FBI's wanted list. They're charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, among other related crimes.\n\nThe indictment marks the first time the Justice Department has brought charges against cybercriminals involved in a ransomware and extortion scheme, according to Rosenstein.\n\nRansomware has grown in sophistication and distribution in recent years. According to a report by the cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, ransomware payments were expected to reach a record $2 billion in 2017.\n\n'Trend' from Iran\n\nThe charges are also the latest in a string of indictments brought against Iranian hackers and cybercriminals in recent months. In March, prosecutors charged nine Iranian hackers with penetrating the computer networks of hundreds of American and foreign universities and other institutions to steal valuable research material. Unlike some of the previously indicted Iranian hackers, however, Savandi and Mansouri are not believed to have ties to Tehran.\n\n\"The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cybercriminal activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities,\" said Amy Hess, executive assistant director of the FBI. \"As cyberthreats evolve and cybercriminals develop more sophisticated techniques, so do we.\"\n\nThe 35-month computer hacking scheme led by Savandi and Mansouri began in January 2016 with an attack on an unidentified business in Mercer County, New Jersey, and moved on to public entities such as the City of Newark and health care providers such as Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said the Iranian hackers carefully chose their targets. A few days prior to attacking the network of Kansas Heart Hospital, for example, they \"conducted online searches concerning the hospital and accessed its website,\" he said.\n\nKimberly Goody, manager of cybercrime analysis at cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the hackers probably chose to target health care and government organizations because \"they provide critical services and believed their likelihood of paying was higher as a result.\"\n\nThe indictment does not name the entities that paid a ransom."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Seoul\u2019s Telecom Outage Highlights Need for Redundancy in Connected World", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-telecom-fire/4677704.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Residents in Seoul discovered how fragile their telecommunications system was this past weekend when a fire disrupted service for millions. The government and the provider vowed to implement changes to avoid a repeat of the event, but the system failure demonstrated a need for greater redundancy and preparation for future natural and technological disasters.\n\nThe fire affected customers of KT, the nation\u2019s second largest telecommunications company. They found themselves unable to make calls, access the internet, complete ATM or credit card transactions, and watch television. Local media also reported an elderly woman died when she fell ill and her husband wasn\u2019t able to reach emergency services during the service outage.\n\nLee Manjong, chairman of the Korean Association for Terrorism Studies and professor of the department of Law & Police at Howon University, told VOA that while it is nearly impossible to prevent widespread system outages, certain steps can be taken to avoid catastrophic failures.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to split the public safety net (fire, medical, and police emergency services) and make system backups (redundancies) compulsory,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the blaze, South Korea\u2019s minister of Science and ICT (Information, Communications, and Technology), You Young-min, spoke to the CEOs of South Korea\u2019s three major communication companies (SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+) to discuss their backup plans.\n\nYou said the companies \u201cneed to swiftly change their contract clauses on compensation issues and also need to come up with plans that would reroute traffic if such accidents, which shouldn\u2019t happen again, happen.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for specifics on what steps the government planned on taking to prevent a similar event in the future, the ministry declined to offer specifics, stating that responsible parties would prepare fire prevention measures this year and set up a task force to implement recommendations.\n\nLocal broadcaster MBC also reported that telecommunication companies and the government held a 20-minute virtual natural disaster drill in May to simulate a system outage, but the simulation proved to be ineffective in real-world situations.\n\nInterconnected services\n\nThe Seoul fire and resulting system outage demonstrated how interconnected services are in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIf a network is down, then it affects other networks such as finance, power, energy, and railway,\u201d said Lee.\n\nHe said there are multiple ways the electronic infrastructure can be paralyzed.

However, Lee notes disruptions caused by cyber incursions are more effective.\n\n\u201cCyber attacks are more efficient as they can take place without access to the physical location of the target,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Lee, this is because the government is able to secure physical sites, so cyber-warriors choose \u201csoft targets\u201d connected through the Internet.\n\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attack could be launched from the Internet and attack telecommunication networks. This type of attack floods a computer network with incoming data packets and overwhelms the system, effectively shutting it down. Lee said such attacks on telecom systems could wreak havoc and paralyze communication.\n\nHe cautioned that a successful cyber attack on South Korea\u2019s technological infrastructure could yield \u201cunimaginable\u201d damage because of the country\u2019s reliance on networked services.\n\nFire and recovery\n\nSaturday\u2019s fire struck an underground facility of KT, destroying telephone lines and fiber optic cables, taking about 10 hours to suppress.\n\nSeoul authorities rate facilities on a scale from A to D. Buildings rated A, B, or C must have adequate fire prevention systems installed, while those receiving a D rating do not.\n\nKT\u2019s Ahyeon facility, where the fire took place, was one of 27 D-rated facilities belonging to the company. As such, fire scene investigators found there were no fire detectors or sprinkler system installed at the Ahyeon facility and only a single fire extinguisher present.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s other telecommunication carriers utilize over 800 similar facilities throughout the country, none of which are required to have fire detection equipment or sprinklers installed.\n\nLee said government regulations must be altered to bridge the gaps to ensure that such facilities are required to have redundant services elsewhere in the event of a natural disaster or cyber attack.\n\nEstimates are the blaze resulted in about $7 million in property damage. KT has announced it would compensate affected customers by awarding them a free month of service for their inconvenience. KB security expects that amount to total about $27.5 million.\n\nIn a text message to customers, KT said it was \u201cdeeply sorry for the inconvenience. We will adopt preventive measures such as safety inspections\u2026 to avoid a recurrence.\u201d\n\nSeoul officials told VOA the cause of the fire remains unknown and the investigation to determine its source could last a month.\n\nLee Ju-hyun contributed to this report."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "France Steps Up Fight Against Sexual Violence With Online Platform To Report Attacks", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-violence-against-women_us_5c0003f6e4b0864f4f6b17de", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The French government launched an online platform this week for reporting sexual and gender-based violence, days after tens of thousands of protesters in the country joined a global call to end violence against women.\n\nThe service will allow victims or witnesses of sexist violence to share information with authorities via their computers or mobile devices.\n\n\u201cFrom now on, a few clicks can help each woman to make a fresh start: for herself, for her family, and perhaps to avoid the worst,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said in a statement on Sunday, the United Nations\u2019 International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron first announced plans for the platform a year ago, as the global Me Too movement was taking off and French women began sharing their own stories of harassment with the viral hashtag #BalanceTonPorc \u2015 meaning \u201csqueal on your pig.\u201d\n\nMacron has made the fight against gender inequality and sexist violence one of the key causes of his presidency.

A lot has happened since then. (Midterm elections, anyone?) If you\u2019re wondering why Cohen was back in the news on Thursday with a fresh guilty plea, we don\u2019t blame you.\n\nHere\u2019s a refresher on who Cohen is, why he\u2019s implicated in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and what his guilty plea may mean.\n\nWho is Michael Cohen?\n\nCohen used to be Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney and fixer. He first joined the Trump Organization in 2006 and over the years the two men developed a close rapport. More recently, Cohen emerged as one of the president\u2019s most loyal supporters, defending him against Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, two women who alleged they had extramarital affairs with Trump, and criticizing the efforts of Mueller\u2019s team. The lawyer told Vanity Fair in September 2017 that he\u2019d \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump and that he viewed his role as \u201cthe guy who protects the president and the family.\u201d\n\nBut that all started to unravel earlier this year when Cohen himself became the target of a federal criminal investigation into possible bank fraud and campaign finance violations. The men parted ways after the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s office, home and hotel room in April. Cohen reportedly felt abandoned by Trump, whom he\u2019d vigorously defended in the face of numerous controversies over the years.\n\nDidn\u2019t he already plead guilty to something?\n\nThe April raid stemmed, in part, from a $130,000 payment that Cohen made to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, reportedly in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement that would prevent her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with Trump back in 2006. Investigators were looking into whether the payment constituted a violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Stormy Daniels received hush money before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for not talking about an alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in August to illegally interfering in the 2016 election at the direction of the president. He also pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, two counts related to an illegal campaign contribution and one count of making a false statement.\n\nUnder that plea agreement, he would not be prosecuted criminally on a number of charges if he cooperated with ongoing investigations. The government said that Cohen should receive a prison sentence of between 4 1/4 and 5 1/4 years, while the defense said his sentence could be as low as less than four years.\n\nSo what did Cohen plead guilty to this time?\n\nAs part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation, he pleaded guilty Thursday to lying to Congress about the timing and extent of his negotiations over a Russian real estate deal involving Trump\u2019s business. Those talks took place during Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nCohen admitted in court that he was engaged in discussions to build a tower for Trump in Moscow as late as June 2016, though he told the House Intelligence Committee last year that the talks ended in January 2016.\n\nThe lawyer also lied about whether he and Trump, referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in Thursday\u2019s documents and in the August charges, discussed planning a trip to Russia during the campaign.\n\nWhy did Cohen take a plea deal?\n\nThe plea deal may help him avoid additional prison time. According to the plea agreement, his sentencing range on the new charge would likely be between zero and six months in prison.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this courtroom sketch, Michael Cohen (center) reads a statement in federal court in New York on Nov. 29, 2018.\n\nThe document also stated that in addition to this deal with Mueller\u2019s office, Cohen was entering into another agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, which is prosecuting him on the August charges. The plea deal itself acknowledged that it could affect his sentencing on those prior charges.\n\nWill Trump pardon Cohen?\n\nIt seems unlikely the president will pardon his former attorney. Trump responded to Cohen\u2019s guilty plea on Thursday by calling him \u201ca weak person\u201d and claiming he was lying. The president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement that Cohen is \u201ca proven liar who is doing everything he can to get out of a long-term prison sentence.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, said in August that his client wouldn\u2019t accept a pardon from the president, anyway.\n\nHow is this part of the Mueller investigation?\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s team is looking into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The real estate project may prove significant on that front.\n\nAccording to emails that the Trump Organization provided to the House Intelligence Committee last year, the project was pitched to Cohen by a Russian immigrant and former broker for Trump\u2019s company named Felix Sater in November 2015.\n\n\u201cBuddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater wrote in an email to Cohen. \u201cI will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.\u201d\n\nPatrick McMullan via Getty Images Felix Sater (center, holding the microphone) attends a launch party for the Trump Soho Hotel Condominium in Manhattan on Sept. 19, 2007.\n\nTrump told reporters on Thursday that he had the opportunity \u201cto possibly do a deal, to build a building of some kind in Moscow.\u201d He said he abandoned the project to focus on running for president but claimed that \u201cthere would be nothing wrong if I did do it.\u201d\n\nWhere does the Mueller investigation stand now?\n\nCohen\u2019s guilty plea comes just days after Mueller accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to investigators even after pleading guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nA number of other men once within Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2015 including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos \u2015 are among the dozens of people indicted thus far in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nWhat happens to Cohen next?\n\nAs long as he doesn\u2019t violate the terms of Thursday\u2019s plea deal, Cohen could face a sentence of up to six months in prison and a fine of between $500 and $9,500 for lying to Congress. The court has not yet set a date for his sentencing. He is due to be sentenced for the prior plea agreement on Dec. 12."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "If Trump Thinks Michael Cohen\u2019s Plea Is Bad, Wait Till Dems Run The House Intel Committee", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-michael-cohen-robert-mueller_us_5c006212e4b0249dce732a0f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS After his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation on Nov. 29, President Donald Trump dismissed Cohen as \u201ctrying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Thursday to lying to key congressional intelligence committees to help his ex-boss, but even worse news for the president is now just five weeks away.\n\nCome Jan. 3, the House version of that committee will no longer help Trump undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and will almost certainly help it instead.\n\n\u201cPlaytime is over,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a prominent Republican critic of Trump who has been sounding the alarm about Trump\u2019s connections to Russia since 2016. \u201cThere is no more fun, funny, amusing moment when Donald Trump gets to have Devin Nunes run interference for him, go out and lie to the press for him.\u201d\n\nNunes is a Republican congressman from California and Trump loyalist and was a member of his transition team. For the past 22 months, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which Nunes chairs, has openly worked with Trump and his White House aides to discredit Mueller with selective leaks to conservative media. Nunes even wrote a memo that he claimed would prove Mueller\u2019s investigation was an abuse of power and then had Trump declassify it for general release.\n\nNunes\u2019 office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who will take control of the committee in January, said he will \u201crestore\u201d oversight of the intelligence community, \u201cincluding outstanding questions in the Russia investigation.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will do this work regardless of the posture of the president or the White House, as the American people expect and as is our job.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who will likely become speaker in the new Congress, after her party picked up 40 seats in this month\u2019s midterm elections, said that oversight committees will be looking for the truth, not covering up for Trump, and that she hopes Republican members will work with them.\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans have been complicit in the Trump administration\u2019s culture of corruption,\u201d said Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne. \u201cOur challenge will be to overcome the Trump administration\u2019s stonewalling.\u201d\n\nThat Mueller used Cohen\u2019s false congressional testimony to charge him in federal court serves as a warning to those who have already testified on the Russia probe as well as those who will do so under Democratic control.\n\n\u201cThe world will look a lot different,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe Trump White House will keep creating new opportunities to perjure themselves.\u201d\n\nCohen worked for Trump\u2019s business and for him personally for nearly a dozen years. He previously pleaded guilty to arranging illegal payments in the closing days of the 2016 campaign to a porn actress and a Playboy model to keep them from discussing the affairs they said they had with Trump. Thursday\u2019s plea was regarding Cohen\u2019s false testimony to Congress about Trump\u2019s efforts to build a hotel in Moscow.\n\nTrump claimed during the campaign \u2014 falsely \u2014 that he had no business interests in Russia. In fact, Cohen told a federal judge, negotiations to build a Trump hotel there continued through most of the 2016 campaign, and Cohen had lied about it to Congress to protect \u201cIndividual 1,\u201d the owner of the company he worked for, which is to say, Trump.\n\nAs he left the White House on Thursday morning to attend the G-20 summit of the world\u2019s largest economies in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Trump falsely claimed that his efforts were well known throughout the campaign and that he had every right to pursue the Moscow project.\n\n\u201cIf I did do it, there would have been nothing wrong. That was my business,\u201d he said, and then added that the only reason Cohen pleaded guilty Thursday was to avoid getting a long prison sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s a weak person and not a very smart person. What he\u2019s trying to do is end \u2015 and it\u2019s very simple. He\u2019s got himself a big prison sentence, and he\u2019s trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story.\u201d\n\nPlaytime is over. Rick Wilson, Republican political consultant\n\nMueller\u2019s decision to schedule Cohen\u2019s new guilty plea just as Trump was leaving the White House on a foreign trip where he was to meet one on one with Russian President Vladimir Putin echoed Mueller\u2019s indictment of a dozen Russians for interfering in the 2016 election just days before Trump was scheduled to meet with Putin in Helsinki.\n\nThe timing was not lost on Trump\u2019s lawyer handling Mueller\u2019s criminal investigation. \u201cIt is hardly coincidental that the special counsel once again files a charge just as the president is leaving for a meeting with world leaders at the G20 summit in Argentina,\u201d Rudy Giuliani said in a statement. \u201cThe special counsel did the very same thing as the president was leaving for a world summit in Helsinki.\u201d\n\nTrump went ahead with that meeting in July, for which he received renewed criticism for appearing to accept Putin\u2019s denial of having interfered in the election on Trump\u2019s behalf. But Trump canceled this coming meeting just minutes after boarding Air Force One. He blamed the decision on Russia\u2019s recent aggressive actions toward Ukraine in the Black Sea, though, rather than the Cohen plea.\n\nThe FBI has been investigating Trump and his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia since before his election. Trump openly praised the country\u2019s authoritarian ruler throughout his campaign, and Putin\u2019s spy agencies worked to elect Trump by stealing emails from Democrats and releasing them through an ally, WikiLeaks. Trump repeatedly praised WikiLeaks and pointed to the stolen emails as proof that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was corrupt."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Methodist Church Sign Subtly Criticizes U.S. Use Of Tear Gas At The Border", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/methodist-church-tear-gas-sign_us_5c002044e4b08506231abd1a", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Politicians visiting Capitol Hill this week might have witnessed a truly elegant display of shade outside a United Methodist Church building.\n\nThe sign outside the UMC building referenced Matthew 25:35, a Bible verse about welcoming the stranger that has become a rallying cry for those opposed to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nBut the building\u2019s version of the verse had a twist.\n\n\u201cI was a stranger and you tear gassed me,\u201d the sign reads. \u201c...Wait a second.\u201d\n\nTwitter / @umcjustice A sign outside the United Methodist Building criticizes federal agents' decision to use tear gas on immigrants, including children, at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe sign, located right next to the Supreme Court and steps away from the Capitol, subtly condemned federal agents\u2019 use of tear gas at the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday.\n\nBorder Patrol agents used tear gas to drive back migrants breaching a fence to enter the U.S. at the San Ysidro border crossing.

It has often been used in the past to make statements about the issues of the day or to celebrate particular seasons.\n\nChurch and Society sees the sign as an extension of the church\u2019s advocacy work, Gill said. For example, during the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the sign read, \u201cWomen have the right to live without violence.\u201d\n\nGill said he believes law enforcement officials should be banned from using chemical weapons like tear gas against civilians, especially children.\n\n\u201cI think Jesus was clear.

Epstein was facing a federal indictment for trafficking and abusing minor girls for at least six years, according to a bombshell report in the Miami Herald. The FBI had identified at least three dozen girls sexually abused by Epstein, but the investigation turned up more than 100 \u201cJane Does,\u201d the Herald reports.\n\nWith Acosta\u2019s help, Epstein got off with essentially a slap on the wrist for his extraordinary crimes \u2015 a short 13-month stint in prison, which he was allowed to leave for days at a time on work release.\n\nThe victims were not even told about the plea deal, which also ensured that no one who had helped facilitate Epstein\u2019s crimes would be prosecuted. Epstein\u2019s victims never even had a chance to tell their stories, until the Miami Herald reached out and several came forward.\n\nLawyers say the deal Trump\u2019s future labor secretary clinched was extraordinarily lenient, considering the breadth of evidence involved \u2015 stories from the victims were remarkably similar and showed a clear pattern, witnesses were available, and victims were willing to come forward.\n\n\u201cThis was not a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 situation. This was 50-something \u2018shes\u2019 and one \u2018he\u2019 \u2014 and the \u2018shes\u2019 all basically told the same story,\u2019\u2019 retired Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter, who supervised the police probe, told the Miami Herald.\n\nAcosta did not respond to the Herald\u2019s press queries. In an email to HuffPost, a Labor Department spokeswoman said, \u201cThis matter has been publicly addressed previously, including during confirmation hearings.\u201d\n\nAcosta is currently on the \u201cshort list\u201d for attorney general, according to some reports.\n\nConsider Epstein\u2019s story to be the latest and possibly most egregious chapter in the long-suffering saga of rich, powerful men getting away with abusing women: From Harvey Weinstein to Les Moonves and beyond.\n\nBut in this case these weren\u2019t adult women, but children so young that some were still in braces. Epstein and his powerful defense attorneys \u2015 including Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr \u2015 argued that they were prostitutes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have every reason to believe you\u2019d put this guy away for life and put away those who helped him,\u201d Michael Dolce, a lawyer in Palm Beach, Florida, who represents sex abuse victims, told HuffPost. Dolce said he was close to speechless when he learned of Epstein\u2019s sweetheart deal.\n\n\u201cThis is breathtakingly shocking,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a sad twist, Acosta was only nominated to the position of labor secretary after Trump\u2019s first pick \u2015 Andrew Puzder, the former CEO of a burger chain \u2015 withdrew himself from consideration after reports that he\u2019d been accused of abusing his ex-wife when they were married. At the time it looked like a win for women\u2019s rights supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Acosta sailed through the nomination process fairly uneventfully \u2015 even though Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) opposed his appointment because of how he handled the Epstein case. (Though it was previously known that Acosta played a role in negotiating the deal, the details of that agreement had been kept secret until the Herald\u2019s report.)\n\nNow his name has been floated as a replacement for Jeff Sessions as attorney general.\n\nThe entire Miami Herald investigation deserves a full read, but it\u2019s worth recounting some of the details here:\n\nPolice said Epstein operated a \u201csexual pyramid scheme,\u201d in which he would recruit vulnerable young girls, many of whom were poor or had a history of family trauma, to come to his pink waterfront mansion and give him \u201cmassages\u201d while he was undressed. In some cases, he\u2019d then rape or assault the girls, according to investigators.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted money for school clothes, for shoes. I remember wearing shoes too tight for three years in a row,\u201d one victim told the Herald. \u201cWe had no family and no guidance, and we were told that we were going to just have to sit in a room topless and he was going to just look at us.

A committee of more than a dozen of those scientists released a consensus statement condemning He\u2019s \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d news. They also called for an independent review to assess exactly what he and his team had done.\n\nThe 2018 consensus statement also affirmed the summit\u2019s initial stance, first published in 2015, that genetic editing on sperm, egg or embryo cells that go on to become pregnancies is still too risky to attempt and that there are too many unknowns.\n\nWhat Is CRISPR-Cas9?\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 forms the basis of a tool used to make genetic alterations in DNA. It is not the world\u2019s first gene-editing tool, but it is the cheapest, easiest, most accessible and most accurate one to date.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 itself is a component of the immune systems of bacteria. CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which is a mouthful of a term scientists use to describe particular types of DNA sequences present in bacterial genomes. These sequences act as genetic memory banks that bacteria use to protect themselves from invaders like viruses.\n\nThe first time a virus invades a bacterium, the bacterium stores a snippet of the virus\u2019s genome in its own and transcribes it into strands of RNA that will recognize the viral DNA if it invades again. In that case, those RNA strands direct special enzymes called CRISPR-assisted proteins (Cas) to the known DNA snippet in the invading virus. The enzyme goes to work to chop up the DNA, deactivating the threat.\n\nGenetic scientists harness this seek-and-destroy mechanism to make targeted changes in DNA. MIT scientist Feng Zhang, who was integral in developing CRISPR-Cas9 applications for use in plant, animal and human cells, compares CRISPR-Cas9 to a tool that can find and replace typos in a Word document. First, CRISPR finds the mistake that needs to be fixed, and then the enzyme Cas9 cuts it out and replaces it with a new word.\n\nTo use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit a strand of DNA in a cell or animal, a scientist first creates a small circle of DNA that includes the genetic code for bacterial Cas9 and instructions for the cell to produce many copies of the enzyme. She inserts that circle of DNA, called an expression plasmid, into the cell, along with another plasmid loaded with information about the genetic sequence she wants the Cas9 protein to find in the genome. This second plasmid will be transcribed into strands of RNA, which will guide the Cas9 enzymes to the target gene in the cell\u2019s DNA. Together, they find the targeted gene sequence and snip it out.\n\nDepending on the scientist\u2019s goals, she can either hope the cell takes it upon itself to repair the snipped DNA (leaving a double helix devoid of the targeted gene sequence), or she can inject a new strand of DNA that she wants the cell to use in place of the snipped DNA.\n\nThe uses for this genetic tool are practically limitless, said Josephine Johnston, director of research at The Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute.\n\n\u201cIts potential applications are gigantic,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cThis is something that can be used in bacteria or fish or mosquitoes or farm animals or humans.\u201d\n\nTake wildlife conservation. Invading predator animals like rodents and possums have decimated New Zealand\u2019s vibrant and diverse local bird species. Conservationists in that country are excited about the possibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce a genetic code into the rat population that would make it more difficult for them to reproduce, thereby driving down their numbers and giving the birds a chance to repopulate.\n\nPublic health researchers also wonder if they can use CRISPR-Cas9 to make it more difficult for mosquitoes to spread devastating diseases like malaria or Zika virus to human beings, either by making mosquitoes resistant to the disease itself or by simply altering their genetic code so that they stop reproducing altogether.\n\nBut with wide-ranging possibilities come serious concerns.\n\nThe Telegraph Scientist He Jiankui outraged the gene editing community with his announcement that he had used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit two embryos and then transferred them to become pregnancies.\n\nGenetic editing on sperm, egg or embryo cells, called germline editing, is what has the world\u2019s scientists and governments most concerned about this technology. This is because any alterations in these cells\u2019 genes will not only alter the DNA of that future person but the DNA of all of their future descendants, too. And because the technique is new, there\u2019s no telling what unforeseen consequences this could mean for genetically altered babies and the societies they live in.\n\nIn an interview with Boston public radio station WBUR, CRISPR pioneer Zhang explained some of the potential health problems these twin babies may encounter because of their altered genes.\n\nZhang said that CRISPR-Cas9 has been observed to occasionally edit genes that weren\u2019t the original target, so He may have altered more than he intended. There\u2019s also the fact that genes may sometimes play several roles, and an alteration to create one effect may have an unintended consequence in those other roles.\n\nFor instance, the AP story that first broke He\u2019s news notes that the gene he altered in the two embryos to make them resistant to HIV may also have made the children more prone to dying from the flu or getting West Nile virus.\n\nMany worry that using CRISPR-Cas9 for germline editing will lead to so-called designer babies, engineered with what Johnston called \u201csocially valuable traits\u201d like IQ or athletic ability.\n\n\u201cThere will be companies marketing those kinds of services in the future and it will be very difficult for prospective parents to navigate those offers,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s super important to be talking about this now and trying to flesh out the arguments for and against enhancement purposes.\u201d\n\nZhang called for a global moratorium on using the tool to create any more human embryos that will then be used in a pregnancy. The consensus statement is also clear that if scientists use CRISPR-Cas9 on human embryos, they shouldn\u2019t then be transferred to a woman to establish a pregnancy like He did.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to really cure some of these awful diseases that have plagued humanity for years. Debra Miller, Founder of CureDuchenne\n\nAs scary as its unintended consequences may be, if CRISPR-Cas9 research continues to the point where those kinds of safety issues are ironed out, Johnston believes that society will find it relatively easy to approve of gene editing techniques to cure serious diseases that have no other medical therapy. Indeed, most Americans already say that gene editing to cure or avoid a serious disease is an appropriate use of the tool.\n\nThe application that has most people excited is its potential use in people with rare and incurable genetic diseases. The hope: that CRISPR-Cas9 could be the key to a cure by simply editing out the origin of the problem.\n\nDebra Miller, CEO of the organization CureDuchenne, started the investment group after her son was diagnosed with Duchenne, a kind of muscular dystrophy caused by a defect in the gene responsible for producing the protein dystrophin. Without dystrophin, muscles slowly waste away, becoming weaker and more fragile.\n\nCureDuchenne has helped raise funding for research into the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to find the mutated gene and correct it. A paper on the use of this gene therapy in animals, published last October, found that this particular use of CRISPR-Cas9 restored dystrophin levels in the heart of one dog to 92 percent of normal levels.\n\nThis is significant because most people with Duchenne tend to die in their late teens or early 20s from either cardiac or respiratory failure. Miller\u2019s son is 21.\n\n\u201cCRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to really cure some of these awful diseases that have plagued humanity for years,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMany cancers are genetically driven, and single-gene disorders like Huntington\u2019s disease, fragile X syndrome and cystic fibrosis are either devastating or cause early death.\n\nMiller, whose son\u2019s life may depend on finding a gene therapy for Duchenne, fears that He\u2019s experiment on the twin girls will spark a global backlash against all uses of CRISPR-Cas9."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "How Mowing Overgrown Lots Reduced Shootings In Philadelphia Neighborhoods", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philadelphia-gun-violence-clean-and-green_us_5bfecac7e4b0e254c926c83b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS In Philadelphia, researchers have found that cleaning up and mowing vacant lots reduced shootings that resulted in serious injury or death.\n\nFixing up overgrown, vacant and blighted lots in Philadelphia did more than beautify neglected areas of the city. Those improvements reduced firearm shootings ending in serious injury or death, according to new research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not super costly. You can rely on locate local contractors and community groups to clean and green a lot. The cost of maintaining it is fairly low,\u201d said John MacDonald, one of the authors of the new research and a professor of criminology and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis cleaning-and-greening strategy may have the potential to save lives.\n\nGun violence isn\u2019t equally distributed across cities. Instead it\u2019s concentrated in neighborhoods or even city blocks. In aging deindustrialized cities like Philadelphia, those are often the same city blocks that have run-down and vacant lots.\n\nIn the new study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health this week, researchers worked with the Philadelphia Horticultural Society\u2019s LandCare program to give randomized blighted lots either a full remediation treatment \u2014 meaning they cleaned the lot, put down grass seed, erected a picket fence and then maintained the property \u2014 or a partial treatment involving trash pickup and mowing only. Then they measured shootings before and after the remediation using Philadelphia Police Department data between 2011 to 2015. Untouched blighted lots served as a control group.\n\n\u201cDoing the full intervention, or doing at least a partial intervention of mowing and picking up trash, you see a significant reduction in shootings,\u201d said MacDonald, noting that the full-treatment greened areas saw about a 7 percent reduction and the mowed areas saw about a 9 percent reduction.\n\nThe shootings didn\u2019t just relocate around the corner or a few blocks away, either. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any evidence that crime was displaced,\u201d MacDonald said. Instead, shootings in the surrounding area went down \u2015 not significantly \u2015 but enough to suggest that greening and cleaning might have some spillover benefits.\n\nWhile mass shootings garner headlines, the reality is that more routine urban gun violence makes up the majority of the 14,000 firearm homicides and tens of thousands of nonfatal shootings that happen in the U.S. every year. In Philadelphia, which has a higher homicide rate than New York or Los Angeles, there were 6,000 shootings between 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u2018Greening\u2019 Is Spreading To Other Cities\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania\u2019s latest study builds on years of research at the institution showing a link between remediating blighted urban spaces and reduced crime.\n\nThe relatively uncontroversial nature of cleaning vacant lots may make it an especially appealing option for cities with a combination of decaying vacant properties and gun violence.\n\nCities like Cincinnati, Houston and New Orleans have been inspired to start cleanup and maintenance programs of their own.\n\n\u201cIn the world of gun violence prevention for cities, there aren\u2019t a lot of options out there,\u201d Charles Branas, one of the authors of the new study, told PBS News Hour in 2017. \u201cThis is an apolitical option. The gun lobby has no opposition to this stuff. It\u2019s not in any way changing legal possession of firearms.\u201d\n\nMarc Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who has studied community greening in Flint, Michigan, said that while cleaning and greening might not be controversial in the gun control debate, it can spark a different controversy: fears about gentrification.\n\nStill, he thought the benefits outweighed the costs, at least in the short term. \u201cLiving in places with violence has all kinds of negative health consequences,\u201d he added.\n\nMacDonald noted the limitations of the intervention. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t green a city and just eliminate the chronic problems of gun violence that are highly concentrated in city blocks just by doing remediation to places,\u201d he said, but added that there are other reasons, including potential health and safety benefits, for remediating vacant spaces that extend beyond gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of intervention that I\u2019d like seen evaluated, but also done in cities across the country that have blight problems and vacant land problems,\u201d he said.\n\nA Different Kind Of \u2018Broken Windows\u2019 Philosophy\n\nWhile the researchers can\u2019t know for certain why the intervention worked, MacDonald explained that it\u2019s consistent with \u201cbroken windows theory,\u201d or the idea that there\u2019s a connection between abandoned and unkept property and crime.\n\nFewer signs of decay can change the functionality of a space. If, instead of avoiding an overgrown and vacant space, people are using it and the areas around it for get-togethers and social gatherings, surveillance improves. There\u2019s also a greater sense of social cohesion and more opportunity for the space to be used for socializing than for illegal activities.\n\nAlthough the term \u201cbroken windows\u201d is inextricably tied to the New York City Police Department\u2019s aggressive policing policy \u2015 where officers cracked down on petty crimes like vandalism and public urination in an effort to deter more serious offenses, and disproportionately targeted minorities in the process \u2015 the theory had a life before the NYPD co-opted it.\n\n\u201cA piece of property is abandoned, weeds grow up, a window is smashed,\u201d goes the famous \u201cBroken Windows\u201d article published in The Atlantic in 1982, co-written by a criminologist and a political scientist.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so striking is that the article was actually much more about broken windows than it was about bad people,\u201d said Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist and author of the book Palaces for the People, which explores how investing in social infrastructure can help restore civic life and fight inequality.\n\nBut law enforcement often neglects that nuance. Instead of focusing on improving abandoned properties, cutting weeds and literally fixing the broken windows cited in the article, policymakers jumped right to fighting crime, Klinenberg explained."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Mike Pence Honors World AIDS Day After Fueling HIV Outbreak In His State", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-hiv-aids_us_5c0021cee4b08506231abe89", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The White House honored World AIDS Day on Thursday, and what better person to speak on the issue than Vice President Mike Pence, whose career has included spreading misinformation about condom use and fueling the worst HIV outbreak in his state\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIt is a day to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS,\u201d Pence declared to a room of administration officials and business and faith leaders. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a day to celebrate the remarkable progress that we\u2019ve made in combating this disease and to reaffirm our ongoing commitment to end AIDS as a public health threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are closer today.

That led to the 2013 closure of the lone Planned Parenthood clinic in Scott County, Indiana, which was the area\u2019s only HIV testing center. By early 2015, local health officials were reporting a spike in HIV cases linked to intravenous prescription opioid use. At the height of the outbreak, 20 new cases of HIV were being diagnosed every week.\n\nPence, who became governor in 2013, ignored pleas by local, state and federal health officials to lift the state\u2019s ban on needle exchanges. He said he was morally opposed to needle exchanges because he believed they supported drug abuse, which is not true.\n\nAfter more than two months had passed since the outbreak was detected \u2015 and after opting for prayer instead of action \u2015 Pence finally allowed for a temporary needle exchange program in Scott County. The HIV cases eventually slowed.\n\nWLS \u2013 Chicago Here's then-Gov. Mike Pence with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015. They finally convinced him to lift a ban on needle exchanges to stem a spike in HIV in his state.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s terrible record on HIV/AIDS prevention goes back to at least 2002, when he criticized then-Secretary of State Colin Powell for advising young people to use condoms during sex. Pence claimed, somehow, that condoms don\u2019t prevent STDs and actually threaten people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cColin Powell had an opportunity here to reaffirm this president\u2019s commitment to abstinence as the best choice for our young people \u2026 and so I think it\u2019s very sad,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201dThe other part is that, frankly, condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases, and in that sense, Wolf, this was \u2015 the secretary of state maybe inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Pence argued that the Bush administration should promote abstinence-only education over condom distribution as a solution to the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThe timeless values of abstinence and marital faithfulness before condom distribution are the cure for what ails the families of Africa,\u201d he said on the House floor. \u201cIt is important that we not just send them money, but we must send them values that work.\u201d\n\nFrankly, condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

I got high every single day until I gave birth to her.\u201d\n\nThe rate of opioid use among expectant women ... more than quadrupled from 2004 to 2015.\n\nFindings published this week in the American Journal of Public Health suggest that her experience is indicative of a growing public health crisis in this country as the use of opioids and amphetamines \u2014 especially meth \u2014 during pregnancy skyrocketed in the last decade, particularly in rural areas of the country.\n\nResearchers examined hospital data from some 47 million deliveries around the country from 2004 to 2015 and found the rate of opioid use among expectant women \u2014 as captured through the codes listed on their records \u2014 more than quadrupled from 2004 to 2015, from 1.5 per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2004 to 2005 to 6.5 per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2014 to 2015.\n\nMeth use also jumped during roughly the same time. Detection of amphetamines doubled, from 1.2 per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2008 to 2009 to 2.4 per 1,000 in 2014 to 2015. Hospital coding doesn\u2019t distinguish between illicit amphetamines and prescription drugs, but the researchers said most people treated for amphetamine use took meth.\n\nUse of both types of drugs rose disproportionately in rural counties, and by 2014 to 2015, amphetamine use complicated about 1 percent of deliveries in rural parts of the West.\n\nStudy researcher Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan Von Voigtlander Women\u2019s Hospital, told HuffPost that she and her team were particularly surprised by the rates of meth use they found.\n\n\u201cVery little has actually been published on amphetamine use in pregnancy in the last 10 years,\u201d she said, arguing that relatively little attention has been paid to meth in public health spheres and the media since its heyday in the early and mid-2000s.\n\n\u201cEven among some of my mentors and colleagues, when I\u2019ve tried to tell them about this finding, it\u2019s almost like people didn\u2019t want to hear it. They wanted me to be doing work on opioid use disorder only, because that\u2019s obviously such a big problem and that\u2019s where so many resources have been focused,\u201d Admon continued. \u201cBut I think maybe we\u2019ve been focusing so much on that at the expense of monitoring what is going on with other conditions.\u201d\n\nAnd yet her team\u2019s findings suggest that amphetamines may be particularly detrimental to the health of moms and their babies. The risk of serious maternal complications and death during childbirth was higher among women who had used amphetamines than those who had used opioids, as was the incidence of premature birth.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has spelled out a clear gold standard of care for women who use opioids during pregnancy, recommending \u2014 among other things \u2014 universal screening and medication-assisted treatment with opioid replacement drugs, like methadone or buprenorphine. But for meth use during pregnancy, there isn\u2019t a clear recommended treatment plan.\n\nResearch shows that women who use drugs or drink during pregnancy may be reluctant to seek prenatal care because of social stigma, as well as a fear of being punished or having their babies taken away. Punitive drug enforcement policies are common. Nearly half the states in this country consider substance use during pregnancy to be child abuse \u2014 and in Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, it is grounds for civil commitment.\n\nBy 2014 to 2015, amphetamine use complicated about 1 percent of deliveries in rural parts of the West.\n\nAshley went to prenatal appointments but concealed her drug use from her OB-GYN. When she went into a hospital to deliver, the only people who knew were her boyfriend, who had kicked her out of his place, and her parents, who had taken her in. She described the day her daughter was born as the best of her life and also the worst.\n\n\u201cI just told them everything I had done,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember it, the pain. It\u2019s really hard to describe, but at that point I was almost beyond feeling ashamed. I felt like a terrible person. I felt like I really didn\u2019t have a reason to live.\u201d\n\nAshley\u2019s daughter was diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome and stayed in the hospital for a week before she was transferred to a center specializing in the treatment of drug-addicted babies. She received methadone and stayed in a quiet, dimly lit environment. Anything too bright or too loud made her agitated and caused her withdrawal symptoms to increase. Ashley signed guardianship over to her mom, checked into an in-patient treatment center in Kentucky and stayed for a year. She has been sober since and works as a recovery coach for pregnant women.\n\nHer daughter is now 2 1/2 and stays with Ashley several days a week. The girl loves to sing and dance and these days is very into unicorns. There are some suggestions her speech might be somewhat delayed, but she seems otherwise healthy.\n\nAshley, meanwhile, shares her story in the hopes of spreading the message that substance abuse is a chronic disease, not a moral failing."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Elon Musk Ducks Out Of One Los Angeles Tunnel But Pursues Another", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-los-angeles-tunnel_us_5bffb16ae4b0850623199de0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Although the family members were not named, a person familiar with the situation said Mr. Cohen discussed the deal with Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017, the younger Mr. Trump said that he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the proposed venture to build a new Moscow hotel bearing the Trump name.
