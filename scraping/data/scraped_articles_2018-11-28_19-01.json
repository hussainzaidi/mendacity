MUST WATCH Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16\n\nTrump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.\n\nHe has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discreet public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,\" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been \"upset for weeks\" about \"the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"\n\nDetails emerge\n\nWhile the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.\n\nIn the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it \"totally false and deliberately libelous\" and Wikileaks was \"willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.\"\n\nThe paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.\n\nCNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.\n\nIn another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nSuch is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.\n\nIf there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.\n\nIn his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort , for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.\n\nThere was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been no talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.\n\nPotential impact\n\nFormer Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.\n\n\"What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?\" Ben-Veniste said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.\n\nMueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.\n\n\"A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.\n\nIn the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.\n\nExpectations high\n\nThe latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.\n\nMueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.\n\nSo expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public\n\n\"Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,\" said Ben-Veniste.\n\nSuch a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\n\nThe new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.\n\nTrump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear the White House has said there has been no talk of Trump pardoning Manafort."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Nadler warns Trump 'dangling a pardon' for Manafort is 'close to obstruction of justice'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/5b7qSshlny0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The likely incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee warned President Donald Trump that \"even dangling a pardon\" for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort \"would fortify a claim or a charge of obstruction of justice.\"\n\n\"I suspect they're dangling a pardon in front of Manafort,\" Rep.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nOn the surface, Manafort's failed cooperation appears to be a setback for Mueller and a bullet dodged for President Donald Trump and administration insiders. But Mueller's ability to see through Manafort's lies and rip up the cooperation agreement bespeaks a deeper strength. By Monday's court filing, Mueller effectively declared: I have enough evidence to know Manafort is lying to protect others, and I don't need his half-baked cooperation to prove my case against them.\n\nAs a federal prosecutor, I dealt with dozens of cooperators, including gun and drug traffickers corrupt public officials , mafia leaders and murderers. I spent countless hours interviewing (or \"proffering,\" in the lingo) potential cooperators and assessing whether they were being honest and forthcoming.\n\nFederal cooperation is an all-or-nothing proposition; the cooperator must tell the prosecutor everything he knows about any crime that he or anybody else has committed. There are no half-measures. The cooperator cannot withhold incriminating information about certain people he wishes to protect. This selectivity is the most common cause of failed cooperation, and it appears to be Manafort's undoing here.\n\nWhatever the particular reason for the breakdown, there is no avoiding the conclusion that, had Manafort cooperated fully and truthfully, he likely could have done serious damage to high-ranking administration and campaign officials, including potentially Trump himself. Manafort spent five months as Trump's campaign chair, and he attended inner-circle meetings, including the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower sit-down between Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and a group of Russians who were said to have offered to provide dirt on Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign.\n\nHad Manafort come clean, as required by his cooperation agreement, he could have walked Mueller into the inner sanctum of the Trump campaign during the key months leading up to the 2016 election, during which Russian intelligence agents hacked and disseminated the emails of Hillary Clinton and the DNC in an effort to undermine Clinton and help Trump's campaign. Doubtless, some within the Trump administration breathed sighs of relief when they learned that Manafort's cooperation had tanked.\n\nAt the same time, the very fact that Mueller saw through Manafort's lies -- and appears ready to prove to Manafort's sentencing judge that Manafort lied -- is a subtle but powerful show of strength.\n\nWhen a prosecutor pulls the plug on a cooperator because that cooperator lies, it typically happens not merely because the prosecutor senses in his gut that the cooperator is lying. More often, the prosecutor knows for a fact that the cooperator is lying because the prosecutor has hard evidence to prove the truth of the matter.\n\nHere, we know Mueller has the goods on whatever Manafort lied about -- and whoever Manafort felt a need to protect -- because he told the judge that he \"will file a detailed sentencing submission to the Probation Department and the Court in advance of sentencing that sets forth the nature of the defendant's crimes and lies, including those after signing the plea agreement.\" Translation: Manafort lied, I know it, and I'll prove it at his sentencing if necessary. That should cause serious concern to whoever Manafort sought to protect by lying to federal prosecutors during his proffers.\n\nAs for Manafort himself, Anderson Cooper said it best: How frickin' stupid is this guy? Manafort, now 69 years old, already faced a sentence likely to keep him behind bars for most or all of his remaining life following his August trial conviction on eight crimes, including bank fraud and tax evasion. Manafort then pleaded guilty to additional crimes under a cooperation agreement, which provided him with one potential out: If he cooperated successfully, he could earn a \"5K letter\" from Mueller detailing Manafort's cooperation. (A 5K letter -- named after the relevant provision of the federal sentencing guidelines, section 5K1.1 -- is a letter from the prosecutor informing the judge of the details of the defendant's cooperation.)\n\nI've written many 5K letters, and I know that they can result in drastically reduced sentences. Now, however, Manafort has the worst of all worlds. He has been convicted at trial, he has pleaded guilty to additional crimes, he has broken his own cooperation agreement by lying federal prosecutors, and he has no chance at a 5K letter. Manafort paddled far upstream and now he has thrown his oar into the rapids.\n\nSo, why then would Manafort endanger himself by lying to Mueller? I see two possible explanations. One, perhaps Manafort is simply an arrogant, congenital liar. The trial evidence proved that Manafort believed he could spin a web of lies and get away with them. He got caught lying to banks and the IRS, and now, unsurprisingly, he has been caught by Mueller. Some cooperators understand that they are best served by telling the truth, for better or worse; others play games with prosecutors and end up getting burned.\n\nTwo, Manafort may be playing for a longshot pardon or commutation from Trump. It already has been reported, before Manafort's trial conviction and cooperation plea, that Trump at least discussed the possibility of pardoning Manafort.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPerhaps Manafort has determined on his own that his best chance to earn a pardon is to walk away from Mueller (though it is unclear why Manafort would curry favor with Trump by cooperating with Mueller and then lying; Manafort could have sent the same message of loyalty by refusing to cooperate at all in the first place). Or it is possible -- unproven at this point, but possible, given the chain of events -- that word somehow got to Manafort that, if he scuttled his cooperation with Mueller, he would be rewarded with a pardon. If that happened, then anybody who put the word out, or helped get it to Manafort, would face potential charges for obstruction of justice.\n\nThe failure of Manafort's cooperation at first glance seems like a setback for Mueller. But the fact that Mueller was able to call out Manafort's lies suggests he has plenty of evidence in hand to go after whoever Manafort sought to protect."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Ukraine leader warns of threat of full-scale confrontation with Russia", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/KLYsKqaFFpY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko warned that his country's simmering conflict with Russia could quickly spiral into full-scale confrontation following a maritime clash between the two countries over the weekend.\n\nThe incident between the Kiev and Moscow ended with three Ukrainian ships in Russian custody.

Video of the incident released by Ukrainian officials appeared to show a Russian ship ramming the Ukrainian tugboat. The incident provoked fury in Kiev, while Russia accused Ukraine of acting as the aggressor and called the incident a \"dangerous provocation\" by Kiev. The Kerch Strait -- a shallow, narrow stretch of water just two to three miles wide at one point -- connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea. It's also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait was opened in May.

Indonesian investigators have already pointed to issues with the plane's angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors, which had proved faulty on earlier flights.\n\nAoA sensors send information to the plane's computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air to help determine whether the plane is about to stall.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Lion Air plane crashes off Indonesia A relative of one of the crash victims tosses flower petals from an Indonesian Navy ship on Tuesday, November 6.

What was the problem that may heard on the CVR. So why the action difference, this is the thing we need to find. At the moment I don't have the answer,\" said the NTSC's head of aviation, Capt. Nurcahyo Utomo.\n\nIssue reported two minutes into flight\n\nThe preliminary report said Flight 610 reported a issues minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital on October 29 en route to the city of Pangkal Pinang, on the island of Bangka.\n\nWithin 90 seconds of takeoff, the co-pilot asked air traffic control to confirm air speed and altitude. Thirty seconds after that he reported that they had experienced a \"flight control problem,\" the report said.\n\nAfter the aircraft's flaps retracted following takeoff, the automatic trim problem noted on the previous night's flight returned, until the flight data recorder stopped recording when the plane crashed.\n\nThe report said the pilots on the plane's penultimate flight reported that instruments were showing inaccurate readouts from the angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors.\n\nThe report said that the plane was \"automatically trimming\" on the previous flight -- that is, the computer was adjusting the aircraft's angle -- so the pilots switched to manual trim and, as their safety checklists didn't recommend an emergency landing, they continued to Jakarta.\n\nFurther maintenance on the AoA sensor was carried out in Jakarta prior to Flight 610's takeoff the next morning. After the flight took off, the instruments recorded a substantial discrepancy in the aircraft's angle -- as much as 20 degrees.\n\nAviation expert Geoffrey Thomas called the report \"very comprehensive\" and said that he could not understand why Lion Air had deemed the plane suitable for service.\n\n\"Clearly the plane had serious sensor issues ... why the airplane wasn't pulled out of service beggars belief,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"Tinkering around and replacing parts isn't enough.\"\n\nAs part of the continued investigation, the faulty AoA sensor will undergo further testing, the NTSC said. It plans to finish its report within 12 months.\n\nCaptain's mother: Son said sim training unnecessary\n\nThe pilot's mother Sangeeta Suneja, herself a senior commercial manager with Air India, told CNN after a family briefing Tuesday that her son was \"a sunny boy. He was loved by everybody in his company.\"\n\nShe says her son, Capt. Bhavye Suneja told her there was no updated training simulation session when Lion Air started using the new aircraft.\n\n\"They said it was not required... When the transition happened, he said, 'Mama, I'm going to fly the MAX.' I said, 'How can you do that (when) you don't have (a) simulator session?' He said, 'We don't need to.'\"\n\nComing from an aviation family, she said that Suneja's sister wanted to follow in his footsteps, but that the fatal accident had shaken her faith in the technology.\n\n\"Even my daughter wants to be a pilot. She was so inspired by him she also wants to be a pilot,\" she said.\n\n\"Now I have apprehensions. I don't know. How safe it is. The trust in the machine is shaky now.\"\n\nShe added that air safety regulation across the world needed to be re-established to reaffirm people's trust in air travel.\n\n\"Whenever they (present new aircraft) to the market, where the life of the people is at stake, the regulators must re-establish three, or five, levels of crosscheck...

The Bank of England followed later in the day with its own assessment.\n\nThe United Kingdom would be worse off under all scenarios studied by the government. Officials did not estimate the precise impact of the deal Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with the European Union , but even in the best case it too will mean a weaker economy than remaining in the bloc.\n\n\"It is true that the economy will be very slightly smaller, but if we do the deal in the way that the prime minister has set out and negotiated, that impact will be entirely manageable,\" UK Treasury chief Philip Hammond told the BBC.\n\nThe official estimates underscore the harsh economic reality of Brexit: Under any scenario, leaving the European Union will make Britain poorer than staying in.\n\n\"If you look purely at the economics, remaining in the single market would give us an economic advantage,\" Hammond said.\n\nThe Bank of England said that May's plan could result in new trade barriers that would cause the UK economy to be 0.75% smaller than currently forecast in 2023. If she can negotiate a future trade relationship with the European Union that does not include customs checks or regulatory barriers, the economy could be 1.75% larger.\n\nThere are just four months to go until Brexit, and it's still not clear whether May can deliver an orderly departure from the bloc.\n\nThe legally-binding divorce deal she has negotiated would give business much-needed certainty about the next two years.\n\nBut she still needs to secure approval from a skeptical parliament, and a much looser agreement on the trading relationship after the transition period provides very few details.\n\nAnalysis commissioned by a group campaigning for a second referendum showed the UK economy would be 4% smaller by 2030 under May's deal than it would otherwise have been. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said on Monday that new trade barriers would make it difficult to sell services from the United Kingdom and discourage investment.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May is trying to sell her Brexit plan to a skeptical parliament.\n\nIf May's plan fails, potential alternatives include crashing out of the European Union without a deal, a second referendum or a general election in Britain.\n\n\"The important thing ... is to keep trade flowing as much as we can,\" Hammond told Sky News.\n\nForecasts assume a US-UK trade deal\n\nMay's plan includes a transition period during which most trading rules for companies will remain the same. It would also mean a close relationship with the European Union on trade in financial services, and broad cooperation on transportation and energy.\n\nThe government's estimates are also based on other assumptions, including Britain's ability to strike \"ambitious\" free trade deals with major economies including the United States. That's far from guaranteed\n\nEconomists say the worst possible outcome would be a chaotic Brexit. Crashing out of the European Union would sink the UK economy into recession, analysts have warned.\n\n'No-deal' Brexit worse than 2008\n\nThe government said that leaving without a deal would result in the UK economy being 7.7% smaller 15 years after Brexit. That's compared to current trading arrangements, and assumes no change in immigration. The damage would be even greater if net migration from the European Union dropped to zero, the government said.\n\nSome key sectors of the economy would be especially hard hit by a messy Brexit. Official estimates show that the auto, chemicals and pharmaceutical industries, which trade heavily with the European Union, would be more than 20% smaller over the long run.\n\nThe Bank of England warned in its report that a disorderly Brexit would cause the UK economy to contract by 8%. The value of the pound would slump by as much as 25% and home prices could plummet 30%.\n\nThe economic fallout would be worse than Britain suffered because of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry said the government report shows that failing to secure a deal is not an option.\n\n\"It surely puts to bed some of the more far-fetched ideas that a hard landing Brexit will not seriously hurt the economy,\" said Rain Newton-Smith, the lobby group's chief economist."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Alibaba founder Jack Ma is a member of the Communist Party", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/dVGkKN-Qpgc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Beijing (CNN Business) China's most famous entrepreneur and billionaire has been outed as a card-carrying communist.\n\nJack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba ( BABA ), with a net worth of more than $30 billion, was identified Monday as a Communist Party member by the People's Daily, the ruling party's official newspaper.\n\nThe 54-year-old was being honored by the Chinese government as one of 100 people who have made \"outstanding contributions\" to China's economic transformation in the past four decades.\n\nThe revelation \u2014 for the first time by state-run national media \u2014 comes amid rising concerns over the tightening grip on China's private sector by the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"The fact he is 'outed' as a party member is significant \u2014 it's speaking to the times,\" said Duncan Clark, author of \"Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Man was shot 8 times and died after checking on concerned neighbor's house", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/-JPulk5jBak/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Patrick Smith was the type of guy to always lend a helping hand, wife Elizabeth Smith said.\n\nSo it wasn't out of the ordinary that he went to check on the house of a concerned next-door neighbor who heard noises outside her home.

He was not involved in the new report.\n\n\"What is happening is that these studies use methods that are a bit more liberal and inclusive than the CDC's methods,\" Frazier said, adding that he prefers the CDC's numbers but understands \"that they are likely a bit conservative.\"\n\nThe new study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, which was conducted by the US Census Bureau and which collected information from parents of more than 50,000 children up to age 17. To be included in the estimate, parents would have had to report that their child had ever received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and that they currently had the condition.\n\nThe new numbers were also slightly lower than those in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey. It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study's authors also note that universal screening recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to Frazier.\n\n\"Having prevalence estimates -- even if there is some variation -- helps us to advocate for improved screening, diagnosis, interventions and supports,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn",

MUST WATCH Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16\n\nTrump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.\n\nHe has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discreet public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,\" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been \"upset for weeks\" about \"the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"\n\nDetails emerge\n\nWhile the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.\n\nIn the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it \"totally false and deliberately libelous\" and Wikileaks was \"willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.\"\n\nThe paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.\n\nCNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.\n\nIn another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nSuch is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.\n\nIf there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.\n\nIn his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort , for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.\n\nThere was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been no talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.\n\nPotential impact\n\nFormer Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.\n\n\"What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?\" Ben-Veniste said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.\n\nMueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.\n\n\"A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.\n\nIn the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.\n\nExpectations high\n\nThe latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.\n\nMueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.\n\nSo expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public\n\n\"Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,\" said Ben-Veniste.\n\nSuch a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\n\nThe new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.\n\nTrump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear the White House has said there has been no talk of Trump pardoning Manafort."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: 21 very revealing lines from Trump's 'gut' Washington Post interview", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/LWjFm7p2fx4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump sat down with The Washington Post in the Oval Office on Tuesday, the latest in a series of interviews with major media outlets of late.

We're going to see what happens.\"\n\nThis is Trump's response to the Post's question about the continued presence in Afghanistan. But in truth, it could double as his response to virtually any conflict anywhere in the world. Or really any policy question at all. Talking about things. Going to see what happens. Going to, uh, see what happens.\n\n2. \"Let me go off the record because I don't want to get in the middle of the whole thing.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether he was planning to do anything to help former campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- who signed a plea deal with Robert Mueller's team only to, reportedly, lie to investigators and back-channel information to Trump -- the President of the United States wasn't willing to say anything for the record. Which is verrrry interesting. After his off-the-record answer on Manafort, the Post reporters ask to put it on the record in some form. Replied Trump: \"I'd rather not. At some point, I'll talk on the record about it. But I'd rather not.\" Hmmmmmmmm!\n\n3. \"I see the Democrats are going to want to do something, because they understand too. Those pictures are very bad for the Democrats.\"\n\nTrump's talking about his ask of $5 billion to fund the border wall. And I am not sure where he gets his confidence that \"Democrats are going to want to do something,\" given the fact that every Democrat I've seen quoted of late has been extremely skeptical of Trump's proposed wall spending.\n\n4. \"I know one thing: If she loses, I'll be blamed, and if she wins, I'll be given no credit. That's the only thing I know.\"\n\nThe President of the United States always sees himself as the victim. In this case, he thinks he is the victim of a dishonest media, which is unwilling to give him credit for a Republican senator winning by eight points in a state that is among the most conservative in the country.\n\n5.\"But anyway, do you guys want something to drink?\"\n\nOne thing people who have never interacted with Trump don't get is how incredibly solicitous he is -- particularly of the media. He wants to be seen as a good guy and a smart guy... It's almost as though all of his rhetoric about the \"fake news\" is just a ploy to throw red meat to his base!\n\n6. \"One of the problems that a lot of people like myself -- we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers.\"\n\nOK. Got it. So, if you have \"very high levels of intelligence\" you don't believe in global warming? Someone should tell the 300+ climate scientists who participated in the Fourth National Climate Assessment\n\n7. \"You look at our air and our water, and it's right now at a record clean.\"\n\n8. \"And when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small. And it blows over and it sails over.\"\n\nThis is not The Onion. This is a real quote. On the \"oceans are very small\" point: Oceans cover roughly 70% of the Earth's surface.\n\n9. \"It just flows right down the Pacific, it flows, and we say where does this come from. And it takes many people to start off with.\"\n\nHe's talking about garbage dumped into the oceans in Asia. I think. But I am sure that \"it takes many people to start off with.\"\n\n10. \"If you go back and if you look at articles, they talked about global freezing, they talked about at some point the planets could have freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion.\"\n\nLook. It is true that over millennia, the climate has shifted both cooler and warmer. But that's not what the current climate change problem is about; it's about how rapidly the earth is warming and how humans are impacting that process in deleterious ways. Please do yourself a favor and read this New Yorker piece by Bill McKibben on how climate change is already shrinking our earth.\n\n11. \"As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it -- not nearly like it is.\"\n\nThe thing is: Trump not seeing it when it comes to human activity worsening the planet's warming is entirely irrelevant. He should read the massive study his administration just released on all of this!\n\n12. \"It's on fire, and they're raking it, working so hard, and they're raking all this stuff. If that was raked in the beginning, there'd be nothing to catch on fire.\"\n\n13. \"I am not at all happy with the Fed. I am not at all happy with my choice. I think we have to let it go.\"\n\nJerome Powell, call your office. Actually, maybe don't.\n\n14. \"They're making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"\n\nThis is essential Trump right here. He trusts his instincts more than some nerd's brain. He values his street sense more than something someone read in a book. Virtually every decision Trump makes can be explained by \"my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\" And, no, I am not exaggerating.\n\n15. \"I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay [Powell for Federal Reserve Board chair]. Not even a little bit.\"\n\nMr. Powell, please pick up the red phone. Immediately.\n\n16. \"I'm not blaming anybody.\"\n\nTrump says this phrase repeatedly throughout the interview -- usually as he is blaming someone.\n\n17. \"It's a rough part of the world. It's a dangerous, rough part of the world. But they've been a great ally.\"\n\nTrump's two-pronged justification of not punishing Saudi Arabia for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi: 1) Look, people in that region do bad stuff all the time 2) They've been our ally. So, yeah.\n\n18. \"I know him. I know him well, the crown prince.\"\n\nThe Trump \"gut\" principle is very much on display here. Despite the fact that the CIA has reportedly concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered Khashoggi's murder, Trump is unwilling to say that because he knows MBS -- and knows him well.\n\n19. \"I'm getting advice. I'm the President of this country.\"\n\nOK then!\n\n20. \"So I take everything into consideration, and again, he totally denies it, and he denied it to me on three different occasions, on three different calls, and a lot of other people deny it, too.\"\n\nTrump is using the same logic to defend MBS that he has used in the past to defend Russian President Vladimir Putin when it comes to Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's as though Trump is incapable of understanding that these foreign leaders may not be telling him the whole truth for their own geopolitical reasons. Or he is simply choosing to believe his \"gut\" over \"anybody else's brain.\"\n\n21. \"He wouldn't have to be, but he's still there, so I have no intention of doing anything.\"\n\nOn Mueller, Trump does two things here: 1) Makes clear he could get rid of the special counsel at any point (which it's not entirely clear he could) and 2) reinforces the idea that he has no current plans to make a move against Mueller."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump reiterates demand: $5B for wall funding or face shutdown", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/n1iQGSmFcAU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump reiterated his demand in a new interview that Congress appropriate $5 billion for a border wall, saying he would \"totally be willing\" to shut down the government if he doesn't get the funding.\n\nThe government faces a potential shutdown on December 7 if a funding deal is not reached.

As he moved a jar to catch a sample, the color changed from clear to brown.\n\n\"When mine comes out, it comes out black,\" Enterprise resident John Tiser said as he watched Edwards work.\n\nTiser, Enterprise's newly appointed water board president, was giving Edwards a tour around this rural community in central Louisiana, where residents have struggled with water problems. He says his wife drives 20 miles each direction to do laundry in a town with clear water.\n\nConcerned about the potential health effects for his family, including his two daughters, he ran for a seat on the local water board.\n\nWhat drives him, Tiser said, is \"being sure that they're not consuming anything that 20 years from now is going to wind up hurting them.\"\n\nYears of water system neglect means that the 250-or-so residents there are left with pipes that leak more than 70% of their water into the ground, Tiser said -- all because they can't afford to fix them.\n\n\"We're basically putting Band-Aids when we need to go to the ER. That's where we're at,\" he said.\n\nIt's what Edwards calls America's \"dirty little secret.\" He explains it this way: That often times towns like Enterprise are stuck with aging infrastructure that they can't fix, leaving few options for them to deal with complaints about dirty or contaminated water.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency says the nation needs $743 billion to fix America's water system.\n\nIn his wife's minivan, complete with acid stains on the carpet, Edwards says he makes long drives to small towns that are hurt by dwindling populations, and slowly being forgotten. \"It's the perfect vehicle. I couldn't take a rental car, because I can't explain why there's acid burns in the seats of those. But that van's seen a lot of bad water,\" he said.\n\nEdwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state, and local governments on water quality. His work helped to reveal high levels of lead in the water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nEdwards says Virginia Tech, where he is a professor, supports his work, as long as he can afford to pay for his travel, which he has done for years.\n\nPhotos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Enterprise, Louisiana, resident Jodie Vinson holds a bottle of water from her tap Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Virginia Tech Professor Marc Edwards, left, samples Enterprise's water, which was found to have bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.

Hide Caption 6 of 6\n\nHe has since received an EPA grant of nearly $2 million to seek out water issues in towns like Enterprise.\n\nThe EPA and the federal government do offer grants and loans to towns. But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right?

You should have an independent third party who can properly explain the risks and the benefits.\"\n\nAccording to He, the volunteers were found through an HIV/AIDS volunteer group.\n\nOther concerns have focused on the CCR5 gene, which scientists at the conference said is crucial to the human immune system. Removing it increases the risk of susceptibility for other diseases such as the West Nile virus and influenza.\n\n\"When you change one thing, something else gets changed, too,\" said Feng Zhang, one of the inventors of the gene-editing technique CRISPR.\n\nHowever, many of those in attendance at the Hong Kong conference have pointed out that while He has not necessarily contravened any international regulations, his purported use of CRISPR represents a clear break with convention.\n\n\"There's a fairly tight consensus from what is and is not acceptable in genome editing as of now, and He's reported work represents a departure from that,\" said David R. Liu, professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University, who has pioneered improving versions of CRISPR.\n\nThe conference, which is attended by leaders in the fields of genetics and ethics as well as policy-makers, is expected to issue a statement on the development during its closing session Thursday.\n\nAfter He's presentation, conference Chairman David Baltimore said the research was not medically necessary, as there are other treatments for HIV. Baltimore criticized He's lack of transparency and referred to an agreement made at the 2015 conference that said it would be irresponsible to use such gene editing until safety issues had been dealt with.\n\nChina a leading player\n\nChina has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, bankrolling research into a number of world \"firsts,\" including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene-editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.\n\nLast year, China spent a record 1.76 trillion yuan ($254 billion) on research and development , and the country is catching up with the US's investment in the same area, spurring a genetic arms race that has been labeled \"Sputnik 2.0\" by Dr. Carl June, an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement issued Monday, more than 120 Chinese scientists condemned He's use of the CRISPR-Cas9 tool as a \"huge blow\" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research.\n\n\"It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientists who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics,\" they wrote, adding that \"directly experimenting on human is nothing but crazy ... as soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring, as the modified inheritable substance will inevitably blend into human genome pool.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has also ordered an \"immediate investigation\" into He's claims.\n\nJUST WATCHED What is CRISPR Cas9 gene editing?

They illustrate what could happen not necessarily what is most likely to happen.\n\n\"Taken together the scenarios highlight that the impact of Brexit will depend on the direction, magnitude and speed of the effect of reduced openness of the UK economy,\" Bank of England governor Mark Carney said.\n\nWhat is a 'disorderly Brexit'?\n\nThe Bank of England has made a number of assumptions - not forecasts - about what would cause a disorderly Brexit.\n\nThe UK reverts to World Trade Organization rules\n\nNo new trade deals are implemented by 2022\n\nThe UK loses all access to existing trade agreements between the EU and third countries\n\nSevere disruption at borders because of customs checks\n\nMigration reverses from 150,000 a year to falling by 100,000 a year\n\nThe Bank of England does not give a probability of this happening.\n\nWhat happens during this disorderly scenario?\n\nScenarios drawn up the Bank of England show that GDP would fall by 8% in 2019 against its current forecast.\n\nGrowth would quickly resume and the economy would expand again by the end of 2023 but be smaller than where it was before.\n\nUnemployment would rise to 7.5%, house prices fall by 30% and commercial property prices collapse by 48%.\n\nInterest rates would reach 4%.\n\nWhat other scenarios did the Bank of England consider?\n\nThe Bank looked at three other scenarios.\n\na \"disruptive\" Brexit - one where the UK retained access to some trade agreements.\n\nwhat might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a \"close\" relationship\n\nwhat might happen if trading arrangements were agreed to give the UK a \"less close\" relationship\n\nA close relationship is one with no customs checks, no regulatory barriers and a partial deal agreed on financial services.\n\nA less close relationship is one where customs checks start after 2021 and other regulatory checks are put in place.\n\nWhat happens in these scenarios?\n\nIf Brexit is disruptive rather than disorderly, GDP falls 3% over the five years to 2022, house prices slide 14%, and unemployment reaches 5.75%\n\nIf a close trading relationship is agreed, the economy could still be 1% smaller than if the UK had remained in the EU but 1.5% higher than the bank's most recent estimate.\n\nIf it is less close, the economy's growth could be 3.75% less than if the UK had remained in the EU and 0.75% less than forecast over the last inflation report.\n\nThese figures cover the period to 2023.\n\nWhat does this mean for Theresa May?\n\nBy political reporter Brian Wheeler\n\nTheresa May will not have told the Bank's economists what to say in their report but it is definitely helpful to her. The timing is significant too.\n\nA leaked copy of Downing Street's media grid had today down as \"economy\". Tomorrow is \"security\".\n\nSo expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit in the run up to 11 December's vote.\n\nDowning Street's hope is that however much they hate her deal (and they do) MPs will come to view it as the only safe option.\n\nThe problem is that these kind of warnings, however well-grounded in facts and figures, are too easily written off as \"project fear\". The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss.\n\nWhat has been the political reaction?\n\nConservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight \"lack all credibility\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Mogg said \"project fear\" had become \"project hysteria\".\n\nAnd the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \"The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land.\"\n\nHowever, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal,\" he said.\n\nWhat else did the Bank say?\n\nMr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary.\n\nHe also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great.\n\nBut he warned there was little the Bank could do.\n\n\"There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail... the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers,\" he said.\n\nWhat does it mean for the banking sector?\n\nThe Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios.\n\nAll seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Referendum may be inevitable - John McDonnell", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46373787", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:19", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McDonnell: \"If we can\u2019t get a general election then the other option which we\u2019ve kept on the table is a people\u2019s vote\"\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested it is \"inevitable\" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election.\n\nAn election remains Labour's preferred option if - as is widely expected - MPs vote down Theresa May's Brexit deal on 11 December.\n\nThe shadow chancellor said forcing an election would be \"very difficult\".\n\nAnd if it was not possible, he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the party would push for another referendum.\n\nMr McDonnell told the BBC's political editor: \"We want a deal that will protect jobs and the economy.\n\n\"If we can't achieve that - the government can't achieve that - we should have a general election, but that's very difficult to do because of the nature of the legislation that David Cameron brought forward.\n\n\"If that's not possible, we'll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote.

I've also seen other polls saying actually we're just about the same as we were then.\"\n\nHe said he had voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum and he believed it was still the \"best option\" but he also respected \"the wishes of the people\".\n\nIf there were to be another referendum, he said, there would be a \"debate\" in the Labour Party about its position but it could not support Theresa May's \"current\" deal, if that were on the ballot paper.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May, who is Conservative Party leader, said that Mr McDonnell's comments about another referendum showed that \"the true Labour position\" was that they want to \"frustrate Brexit\".\n\nSpeaking in Scotland, the prime minister said another referendum would be a \"betrayal of the vote of the British people\" adding that the Government had negotiated a deal that \"delivers Brexit\" while \"protecting jobs, protecting livelihoods, protecting security and protecting our United Kingdom\".\n\nA fresh referendum could be held only if the government legislates for one and a majority in the Commons supports it.\n\nTheresa May has faced repeated calls to hold another referendum from Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Green and a small number of Conservative MPs, who are members of the People's Vote campaign, but has always rejected them.\n\nUnder the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron's coalition government, a general election can be called if two-thirds of MPs vote for one.\n\nAlternatively, if a majority of MPs back a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, a 14-day period is allowed for a new government to be formed with the approval of MPs.

This happened more than 20 times.\n\nIt is unclear why the pilots did not employ procedures to disable the automated system.\n\nNurcahyo Utomo, aviation head at the National Transport Safety Committee, said it was \"too early to conclude\" whether the anti-stall system had contributed to the crash.\n\nHe added that the plane experienced similar problems during its previous flight from Denpasar in Bali to Jakarta.\n\n\"In our opinion, the plane was no longer airworthy and it should not have continued,\" he said. The committee's report itself, though, does not spell out that conclusion.\n\nThe report said that Lion Air's safety culture should be improved and the airline should ensure the operations manual is followed \"in order to improve the safety culture\".\n\nIt also says the carrier must ensure \"all operations documents are properly filled and documented\".\n\nWhat does Boeing say?\n\nIn a statement, plane manufacturer Boeing said that it was \"deeply saddened\" by the loss of the Lion Air flight.\n\n\"As our customers and their passengers continue to fly the 737 Max to hundreds of destinations around the world every day, they have our assurance that the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown in the skies.\"\n\nBoeing said that \"the appropriate procedure to address unintended horizontal stabiliser movement\" was contained in the relevant flight manuals.\n\nIt said that the preliminary report showed that the correct procedures to counter the plane's nose being pushed down were carried out during the Denpasar flight the day before the crash.\n\nHowever, it was not clear if they procedures were followed during the 29 October flight that crashed, Boeing added.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, KNKT aviation head Nurcahyo Utomo appeared to dispute Boeing's account about the flight manuals.\n\n\"We haven't found the information in the manual relevant to the new feature to the 737- MAX, related to the feature for the stall prevention system,\" he said.\n\nSome pilots have also complained that they were not given all the relevant information about the differences between the latest anti-stall system, and older models, US media report.\n\nHow did the 29 October crash unfold?\n\nThe plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down.\n\nThe jet crashed following a request from the pilot for permission to turn back to the airport minutes after taking off from Jakarta.\n\nInvestigators had previously revealed that the plane, on previous flights, had experienced technical problems related to airspeed and altitude readings.\n\nTherefore the \"angle-of-attack\" sensor, which contributes to those readings, had been changed the day before the crash.\n\nThe plane's flight data recorder has been retrieved but authorities are yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder which could provide more information about how the pilots reacted.\n\nVictims' families are suing Boeing over alleged faults with the jet's design, focusing on the automated safety feature.\n\n'We want to understand who is responsible'\n\nRebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia editor, Jakarta\n\nRini Soegiyono's sister and brother-in-law were on the flight. After hearing the preliminary findings, she said she had mixed emotions.\n\n\"Sad, grieving, mourning, angry and disappointed - these are all the words that describe how I am feeling. But I am trying to be objective and strong.\"\n\nShe, like many grieving families, is mostly frustrated that the search for the remaining passengers has officially ended.\n\n\"There are still 64 families who haven't had their loved ones' remains identified and we have had to really push to get Lion Air and the authorities to search again for them. It's not good enough.\"\n\nThey want the airline to fund a search to find the remaining passengers as well as the cockpit voice recorder that hasn't been retrieved. It will be key, she says, to understanding what went wrong.\n\n\"We are watching and waiting to understand who is responsible. I know the world is also watching.

I showed it to Carl,\" he told the inquest.\n\nMr Jones said he told Mr Sargeant in 2014: \"You need to know... be careful, there's obviously someone who's watching you.\"\n\nThe first minister also told him: \"Be careful how you conduct yourself and how much you drink.\"\n\nMr Jones said Mr Sargeant \"wasn't an alcoholic,\" but the company he kept was \"quite a hard-drinking bunch\".\n\nImage copyright JULIA QUENZLER Image caption Leslie Thomas QC questioned Carwyn Jones on how Carl Sargeant's sacking was handled\n\nHe told coroner John Gittins the pair had known each other since 2001 and had \"never had a cross word\" and this remained the case to the end of his life.\n\nMr Jones did not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression or had taken anti-depressants, the inquest heard.\n\nAsked when he first became aware of rumours about Mr Sargeant's conduct, he said: \"Rumours are plentiful in politics. Evidence is rare.\"\n\nHe did not know what the rumours were but became aware of them on 18 October 2017, the day he held a meeting with senior advisors to discuss the cabinet reshuffle.\n\nHe wanted to see \"evidence not rumours\". Asked what had changed, he said: \"The catalyst was the fact we had names. Once the names were known there was, in my mind, an obligation to look further.\"\n\nHe insisted there had to be something in writing, which later came from one of two complainants who had made allegations about Mr Sargeant to the Labour party in October, dating from an event in summer 2017.\n\n\"At that point it was important to protect the anonymity of those complainants,\" Mr Jones said.\n\nPushed by the coroner why he had not spoken to Mr Sargeant, he said: \"Had I given him more details in terms of the allegations... he'd have known straight away, I suspect, who those people were and that was a risk I couldn't take.\"\n\nImage caption Carwyn Jones is stepping down as first minister in December after what he called the \"darkest of times\"\n\nDiscussing a tweet Mr Sargeant sent out on the afternoon after he was sacked, the coroner suggested Mr Sargeant had told the truth when he said he was being removed because of his personal conduct.\n\nMr Jones said: \"There was no need to volunteer the information... there was a gentler way of doing it.\"\n\nThe first minister spoke of a \"feeling of dread going in that morning... I had lost sleep over it,\" but it \"had to be done\".\n\nHe said he did not tell Mr Sargeant the details of the complaint because he \"couldn't\", but did say police were not involved.\n\nMr Sargeant's response was \"curious\", as he had said he \"did not recognise\" the allegations. \"In politics, that's not a denial,\" Mr Jones said.\n\nTweet after dismissal\n\nImage copyright Twitter/ @carlsargeant1 Image caption Carl Sargeant tweeted a statement after being sacked by the Welsh Government four days before he died.\n\nHe was not tearful and was \"a little panicked but not distraught\". Asked if his reaction raised alarm bells, Mr Jones said: \"There was no reason to doubt that he understood the implications.\"\n\nHe advised him to speak to his trade union for advice and \"keep your head down\". After Mr Sargeant had tweeted, however, the Welsh Government had to \"firefight\".\n\n\"The press would speculate. Twitter is corrosive,\" he said.\n\nChallenged on why he felt the need to respond to Mr Sargeant's tweet, he said: \"Because of that tweet there was a media frenzy that made all manner of allegations about Carl that weren't true\".\n\nThe inquest heard audio of Mr Jones speaking on a BBC Wales news broadcast on 6 November, the day before Mr Sargeant died.\n\nIn it, Mr Jones used the words \"incidents\". The coroner asked him if he saw the difference between that and the word \"allegations\".\n\nHe replied no, saying: \"It's quite clear from that news report that the news report is about allegations.\"\n\nImage caption Leslie Thomas QC is representing the Sargeant family\n\nMr Jones had said the reshuffle had happened on a Friday as Mr Sargeant had been away and if it was held mid-week he would not have had the support of his family on hand.\n\nLeslie Thomas QC, representing the Sargeant family, asked Mr Jones about being told by Mr Sargeant in 2014 of a life event he had experienced, and whether it could leave some people feeling vulnerable, which Mr Jones agreed it could.\n\nThe barrister questioned why it was necessary to draw Mr Sargeant's attention to the anonymous letter sent in 2014. Mr Jones felt it was right to let him know, as the letter had also been sent to Mrs Sargeant.\n\nHe had not spoken to Mr Sargeant about a complaint from 2016 because \"the complainant didn't want me to\".\n\nThe inquest heard Anne Jones AM had been arranged to act in a liaison role between the Labour group and Mr Sargeant, and secondly in a pastoral role.\n\nMr Jones told Mr Thomas this had happened on the afternoon following Mr Sargeant's dismissal, adding it was not just \"political issues\" Mr Jones wanted Mr Sargeant to be able to raise.\n\nMs Jones \"wanted to make sure that Carl was okay from a personal level as well,\" he said.\n\nMr Jones told the inquest earlier he planned to hold a reshuffle in November 2017 because he was in discussions with an AM who had left his party, as well as wanting to offer new opportunities to others.\n\n'Complete discretion'\n\nBut during the course of the discussions he had received the written \"complaints\" about Mr Sargeant. Prior to that Mr Jones had characterised rumours about Mr Sargeant as \"tittle-tattle, according to evidence from one of his special advisors.\n\nMr Jones said following the written allegations, which came just days before the reshuffle on 3 November: \"They could not be ignored as part of the reshuffle process.\"\n\nMr Sargeant, who was being considered for the role of leader of the house, was sacked that day.\n\nMr Jones confirmed as first minister it was \"wholly\" his responsibility who was appointed or moved and he had \"complete discretion\" over the cabinet.\n\nEarlier, Mr Jones' senior special advisor Matthew Greenough was recalled to the inquest to clarify some of the evidence he gave on Tuesday, which had given details around the timings of allegations made against Mr Sargeant.\n\nThe \"tangible\" complaints referred to alleged incidents made by women known in court as Miss A and Miss B and had happened in the summer of 2017.\n\nThese were reported via the Labour Party to Mr Jones in October 2017. One of two women involved later made a written statement.\n\n'Rumours' about Mr Sargeant\n\nThere had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter.\n\nUnder questioning, Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015 but he did now know about it until 2016.\n\nHe told the court that when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job took place he was present in the room when Mr Jones spoke to every other minister apart from one.\n\nAsked by Mr Gittins whether any information was mentioned regarding any of the women, Mr Greenough said: \"Not in my presence.\"\n\nHe told the Sargeant family's counsel Leslie Thomas QC he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing.\n\nSpecial advisor Jane Runeckles said discussions about the reshuffle had begun in the summer of 2017 between her, \"Matt and the first minister\".\n\nSpeaking about a meeting on 18 October 2017, she confirmed there were \"rumours\" about Mr Sargeant, but the inquest heard he was still in consideration for leader of the house.\n\nImage caption Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay\n\nThe coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case, to which she replied: \"The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise.\"\n\nThe reshuffle had been motivated by a commitment Mr Jones had made to bring one particular AM into government and because he felt some people had not been given opportunities under previous governments, she told the inquest.\n\nBut Mr Sargeant's sacking was precipitated by Mr Greenough receiving the written statement from one complainant on 1 November.\n\nMr Gittins said: \"That was the deciding factor in terms of his removal from office. Would you agree?\"\n\nMs Runeckles replied \"yes\", adding it would have been difficult to postpone a reshuffle.\n\nThe coroner continued: \"What we have here is a scenario.... 'I know Carl's going, and he's got to go, let's get on with it'... not a picture of 'there is now a process to follow in relation to these allegations being investigated... no-one's taking a deep breath here'.\"\n\nMr Sargeant's brother Andy asked whether Ms Runeckles did anything to support him, and she said \"no\", explaining: \"The whim of the electorate is something [politicians] subject themselves to... you go into it knowing that this kind of thing can happen to you.\"\n\n'Setting the scene'\n\nMr Thomas repeatedly questioned Ms Runeckles over the 18 October meeting and any discussion of the rumours around Mr Sargeant, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and \"political fallout\" in Westminster as a result.\n\nShe told the court she did not enquire where the rumours had come from and said they were \"not relevant\", which Mr Thomas challenged. She agreed she could have spoken to Mr Sargeant about the matter, but did not.\n\nLeslie Thomas QC asked if the reshuffle was \"just a convenient way of trying to mask\" the situation surrounding Mr Sargeant.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" she replied.\n\nMr Thomas asked Mr Jones why, after allegations from Miss A and Miss B in 2017, Miss C - who made her original allegation in 2016 - was contacted to see if she now wished to complain.\n\nHe accused Mr Jones of \"setting the scene\" to \"get rid\" of Mr Sargeant.\n\n\"I could've removed Carl from the cabinet for no reason at all,\" the first minister responded.\n\nHe said he felt it was right someone who had come forward in 2016 should now be asked if they wanted to make a complaint."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Bank warns no-deal could see UK sink into recession", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46377309", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Carney warns of lower pound and higher inflation on no-deal\n\nA no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nIt said the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, while house prices could fall by almost a third.\n\nThe Bank of England also warned the pound could fall by a quarter.\n\nThe Bank's analysis comes after the Treasury said the UK would be worse off under any form of Brexit.\n\nThis Bank's scenario is not what it expects to happen, but represents a worst-case scenario, based on a so called \"disorderly Brexit\".\n\nThe scenario looks at the five-year period after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nBut by the end of 2023, the economy is expected to resume growing.\n\n\"These are scenarios not forecasts.

The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss.\n\nWhat has been the political reaction?\n\nConservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight \"lack all credibility\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Mogg said \"project fear\" had become \"project hysteria\".\n\nAnd the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \"The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land.\"\n\nHowever, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal,\" he said.\n\nWhat else did the Bank say?\n\nMr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary.\n\nHe also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great.\n\nBut he warned there was little the Bank could do.\n\n\"There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail... the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers,\" he said.\n\nWhat does it mean for the banking sector?\n\nThe Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios.\n\nAll seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46373786", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright HOC\n\nTheresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened.\n\nWill the UK be worse off under the prime minister's Brexit plans or not? That was the question Jeremy Corbyn wanted answering at this session, after the Treasury published an analysis suggesting the UK would be less well off under all Brexit options when compared with staying in the EU.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said Mrs May's deal would mitigate \"most\" of the negative impacts of Brexit, said the Labour leader. Which of the negative impacts would not be mitigated?\n\nMrs May said her deal was the best available to protect the economy and \"honour\" the EU referendum result. The \"biggest risk\" to the economy was a Labour government, she added.\n\n\"It is not hard to be the best deal if it is the only deal,\" observed the Labour leader, \"by definition it is also the worst\".\n\nIn fact, he went on, there was no deal \"just a 26-page wish list\".\n\nReferring to Philip Hammond saying the UK would be \"slightly worse off\" under the prime minister's deal, Mr Corbyn noted the chancellor's absence from the front bench and asked if Mrs May agreed with his remarks.\n\nMrs May said: \"The analysis shows the deal we have negotiated is the best deal for the economy and delivers on the results of the referendum.\n\n\"He calls the political declaration a wish list, but this is an ambitious, broad and flexible partnership,\" she added.\n\n\"The Labour Party has six bullet points to offer. My weekend shopping list is longer than that.\"\n\nThe Labour leader quoted a damning UN report, which had said it was \"clear\" the impact of Brexit on people in poverty was an \"after-thought\".\n\nIf the PM's deal was so great, he asked, why were MPs \"not queuing up\" to back it?\n\nFarmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland and employers in Northern Ireland were backing it, claimed the prime minister.\n\nShe defended the government's economic record, saying figures today showed the number of children living in workless households was \"at a record low\".\n\nMr Corbyn quoted the UN report again, which said there were 14 million people living in poverty in the UK. He then quoted business leaders, who had said her Brexit deal was the \"worst of all worlds\".\n\nShe had gone from \"guaranteeing frictionless trade, to offering friction and less trade\", said the Labour leader, and the country had \"no faith\" in the next stage of talks being completed within two years.\n\nDid the PM prefer \"extending the transition with further vast payments to the European Union or falling into the backstop with no exit\", asked Mr Corbyn.\n\nThere is an exit \"from the backstop\", said Mrs May, and it was \"perfectly possible\" to turn the 26-page political declaration into legal text within two years.\n\nThen it was on to the attorney general's legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, which Labour wants published in full.\n\nMrs May had petitioned Tony Blair for the full legal advice on the Iraq war to be published, said Mr Corbyn, what has changed?\n\nMrs May cited client confidentiality and said MPs would get to see a \"full reasoned position statement\" and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement and answer MPs questions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn asks the PM why she does not practise what she preached\n\nMr Corbyn said the government was the most shambolic \"in living memory\" and 20 of her own ministers had resigned.\n\nIt was \"clear that Parliament will not back this plan\", he told the PM and it was time for her to \"accept that reality, make way for an alternative plan that can work for the whole country\".\n\nMrs May said she \"will take no lectures\" from someone who has had more than \"100 resignations\" from his frontbench.\n\nShe said \"what really lies behind Labour's approach\" was a desire to \"cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people... that would be a betrayal of the many by the few\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May says Labour wants to \"cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people\"\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford also made hay with Philip Hammond's comments on the economic impact of Theresa May's Brexit plans.\n\nLabour's Louise Ellmann called for another EU referendum.\n\nDover Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke asked about border security after \"unprecedented\" numbers of migrants crossed the English Channel.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlie Elphicke tells the PM to \"invest more in border security\" over migrants crossing the English Channel\n\nConservative MP Zac Goldsmith asked if the prime minister had \"personally intervened\" to stop the UK offering sanctuary to a Pakistani Christian.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zac Goldsmith: Did Theresa May stop UK offering Asia Bibi sanctuary?\n\nTheresa May told SNP\u2019s Douglas Chapman the government has been working with devolved administrations to ensure \"the voice of the devolved administrations has been heard\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption SNP MP Douglas Chapman on lessons from Brexit negotiations that will help Scotland dissolve the Act of Union.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nAfter the PM endured another 45 minutes at the dispatch box, dodging the Brexit crossfire from the opposition and her own party's various factions, what have we learned?\n\nTheresa May stuck by her line that the government would not release the full text of its legal advice on the Brexit deal - no surprise, really, and it would have been a bit of a surrender and a dangerous precedent, had she agreed.\n\nInstead she said the government's top lawyer, the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, could make a statement to MPs, and answer questions.\n\nDid the answer to Labour's Dame Louise Ellman signal some subtle softening on the issue of a second referendum?\n\nThe PM has rebuffed endless requests for a so-called \"People's Vote\" over the last few weeks, usually observing that there has already been a referendum, and often adding that the main parties at the last election promised to respect the result.\n\nThis time the prime minister did say that it was important to deliver on the decision of the people, but also added that there would not be time to hold a further referendum before Brexit Day - 29 March - as the Article 50 period (the period before the UK left, having given notice of intent to withdraw) would have to be extended.\n\nRandom variation of phrase, or a soft signal of some kind? Hmmm.\n\nJeremy Corbyn enjoyed himself in a target-rich environment, noting that Theresa May once demanded that Tony Blair published his advice on the legality of the Iraq War, and highlighting the opposition to her Brexit deal among her own MPs.\n\nBut the real threat to the PM was behind her, on the Conservative benches. Brexiteers Anne Marie Trevelyan, Peter Bone and David Amess all attacked aspects of the deal, and received polite rebuffs.\n\nAnd the Scottish Conservative Douglas Ross raised the dangers of a fisheries deal which did not meet promises to the fishing industry.\n\nThe PM sailed through it all\u2026 this was much of a muchness with the questioning in the series of Brexit statements over the last fortnight. And perhaps the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu drained some of the hostility from this latest repeat performance.\n\nHard Brexiteers to the right of her, Remainers to the left, Labour with its cannons trained on her, and leadership rivals lurking under camouflage, the PM seems to be heading for certain defeat in the Meaningful Vote in a fortnight.\n\nYet on she goes.\n\nWestminster is, frankly, a bit baffled.\n\nDoes she have some masterstroke to deploy?

So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground.\n\nGetting to this point would require large cuts in emissions from the current position. Since 1990 the EU has cut its emissions by over 20% while the economies of member states have continued to grow.\n\nThey have set themselves much harder targets for 2030 of cutting emissions by 40% - The EU says it will achieve this target but now plans to go much further again by becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n\nHow will they get there?\n\nThe EU have set out eight scenarios for member states to cut warming gases - two of these strategies would see Europe become climate neutral.\n\nThe EU says that this can be done with existing technologies such as solar and wind energy which would have to be ramped up to provide 80% of electricity. Energy efficiency measures such as home insulation would also need to be boosted to reduce energy consumption by half by the middle of the century.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"With this plan, Europe will be the world's first major economy to go for net-zero emissions by 2050,\" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \"We have all the tools to be ambitious.\"\n\nThe EU believes that the measures will help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement will be expensive but will boost economies by 2% of GDP by 2050 and reduce energy imports by over 70%, saving up to three trillion euros a year.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe IPCC report on keeping temperatures below 1.5C was a \"wake-up call\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete. Reports in recent days have also underlined just how far the gap has grown between what countries promised to do under the Paris agreement, and how far they've gotten with those endeavours.\n\nThe UN emissions gap study also showed that the majority of rich countries are not on track to meet their carbon cutting commitments by 2030.\n\nWith global climate talks due to start in a few days in Poland the EU's move, although still a strategy and not a firm commitment, will be welcome news.\n\n\"If we do not lead, no one else will,\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete.\n\nIs everyone in Europe happy with the new strategy?\n\nNot quite. Some countries such as Germany are struggling with their current commitments and are worried that further cuts would threaten their industries. Others such as Poland are still reliant on coal and would object to even more stringent restrictions on the use of fossil fuels.\n\nSome countries though are keen to press ahead - a group of ten, including Denmark, Sweden and Spain have written a letter to the EU asking for a \"clear direction\" towards net-zero emissions.\n\nClimate campaigners say the step, though welcome, doesn't go far enough fast enough.\n\nThey are worried that there is no plan to increase the intermediate targets for 2030, which many scientists say is crucial.

Other countries are looking at it, including the UK which has asked the Committee on Climate Change to report on the idea.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe EU says there needs to be a debate among member states about how to achieve this long term goal.

Nowhere near where the world needs to be.\n\nDoes the report point the finger at countries that are doing badly?\n\nIn some ways yes. The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The burning and clearing of forests in Asia contributes hugely to emissions\n\nThree countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets.\n\nThe authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans.\n\nIs there any positive news in the report?\n\nUndoubtedly, yes.\n\nThe UN is placing great hopes in what it terms \"non-state actors\", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap.\n\nThey estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action.\n\nBut the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.\n\nThe study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.\n\nThe future is fiscal?\n\nThe report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.\n\nIt says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets\n\n\"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.\n\n\"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries.\"\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThis report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland.

Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing.\n\nOne of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander.\n\nIt was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions.\n\nAnd as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars.\n\n\"Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,\" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The MarCO image of Mars.

InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German-led \"mole\" system will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is.

There have been allegations that he ordered the killing, which happened inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. There will be leaders who won't want to get caught in a grip-and-grin situation with MBS.\n\nIt's a photo opportunity that could cause serious ripples, even disgust, and have concrete repercussions at home by appearing to exonerate or legitimise the man US intelligence agencies concluded ordered the killing.\n\nThat won't be a problem for US President Donald Trump, who drew bipartisan ire in the US Congress for effectively giving the prince a free pass in the name of \"America First\", based on the president's vastly exaggerated claims of Saudi military contracts and investments in the US.\n\nIt may well be that Trump will go out of his way to embrace the de facto Saudi leader as others scurry away, treating him as a pariah.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has kept international pressure mounting on Saudi Arabia, is also expected to attend.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center,

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

It reveals that Mueller is keenly focused on whether Americans close to the Trump campaign had any foreknowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked material during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe document's contents were first reported by NBC News, and a copy of it was posted online by The Washington Post. Corsi told The Associated Press on Tuesday evening that the document had been provided to his attorney by Mueller's team. Stone has denied knowing about WikiLeaks plans ahead of time. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.\n\nCorsi said the document, which mirrors similar ones filed by Mueller in previous plea deals, contains portions of emails he exchanged with Stone in the summer of 2016 about WikiLeaks. But he denied that he intentionally lied to investigators about the emails, and said that was why he rejected the plea offer, which would have charged him with one count of making false statements.\n\n\"I did not ever willfully and knowingly give them false information,\" Corsi said. He said he forgot about the emails in question during his first interview with Mueller's team, noting they were among 60,000 contained on the laptop he provided to the special counsel's office.\n\nAccording to the document, the emails were exchanged in late July and early August of 2016, more than two months before WikiLeaks published thousands of emails stolen from the private email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn late July 2016, the document shows, Stone emailed Corsi, asking him to get in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been living in Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012. Stone said he wanted Corsi to try to obtain emails the group possessed about Clinton. The document says Corsi passed Stone's request to an \"overseas individual,\" whom Corsi identified as Ted Malloch, a London-based academic who has said he was also questioned by Mueller. And on Aug. 2, 2016, the document quotes Corsi's response to Stone.\n\n\"Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I'm back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging,\" wrote Corsi, who was in Europe at the time. He then told Stone it was time for Podesta to \"be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC,\" a reference to Clinton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Corsi told the AP that the email he sent Stone \u2014 which accurately forecast that WikiLeaks would release derogatory information about Podesta in October \u2014 was based on his own deduction and not the result of any inside information or a source close to the group.\n\n\"It's all a guess. That email \u2014 'word is' \u2014 is 100 percent speculation on my part, a package so that Roger's not going to dismiss it because I'm real sure I'm right,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he has never had contact with Assange and that he didn't obtain any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans.\n\nCorsi said he disclosed to investigators \u2014 including Mueller team members Jeannie Rhee, Aaron Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein \u2014 that he had told Stone that Assange had Podesta emails. \"But I maintained and still do that I figured it out,\" he said, adding: \"I made it sound maybe like I had a source, but I didn't. And I don't think Stone ever believed me.\"\n\nCorsi said the prosecutors wouldn't believe him, thinking he was trying to protect Stone.

Mainstream scientists have condemned the experiment, and universities and government groups are investigating.\n\nThe second pregnancy is in a very early stage and needs more time to be monitored to see if it will last, He said.\n\nLeading scientists said there are now even more reasons to worry, and more questions than answers, after He\u2019s talk. The leader of the conference called the experiment \u201cirresponsible\u201d and evidence that the scientific community had failed to regulate itself to prevent premature efforts to alter DNA.\n\nAltering DNA before or at the time of conception is highly controversial because the changes can be inherited and might harm other genes. It\u2019s banned in some countries including the United States except for lab research.\n\nHe defended his choice of HIV, rather than a fatal inherited disease, as a test case for gene editing, and insisted the girls could benefit from it.\n\n\u201cThey need this protection since a vaccine is not available,\u201d He said.\n\nScientists weren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cThis is a truly unacceptable development,\u201d said Jennifer Doudna, a University of California-Berkeley scientist and one of the inventors of the CRISPR gene-editing tool that He said he used. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that he appeared today, but I don\u2019t think that we heard answers. We still need to understand the motivation for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel more disturbed now,\u201d said David Liu of Harvard and MIT\u2019s Broad Institute, and inventor of a variation of the gene-editing tool. \u201cIt\u2019s an appalling example of what not to do about a promising technology that has great potential to benefit society. I hope it never happens again.\u201d\n\nThere is no independent confirmation of He\u2019s claim and he has not yet published in any scientific journal where it would be vetted by experts. At the conference, He failed or refused to answer many questions including who paid for his work, how he ensured that participants understood potential risks and benefits, and why he kept his work secret until after it was done.\n\nAfter He spoke, David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate from the California Institute of Technology and a leader of the conference, said He\u2019s work \u201cwould still be considered irresponsible\u201d because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think that it was medically necessary. The choice of the diseases that we heard discussions about earlier today are much more pressing\u201d than trying to prevent HIV infection this way, he said.\n\nIf gene editing is ever allowed, many scientists have said it should be reserved to treat and prevent serious inherited disorders with no good alternatives, such as sickle cell anemia and Huntington\u2019s disease. HIV is not an appropriate candidate because there are already safe ways to prevent transmission, and if contracted it can be kept under control with medications, researchers said.\n\nThe case shows \u201cthere has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community\u201d and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field, Baltimore said.\n\nBefore He\u2019s talk, Dr. George Daley, Harvard Medical School\u2019s dean and one of the conference organizers, warned against a backlash to gene editing because of He\u2019s experiment. Just because the first case may have been a misstep \u201cshould in no way, I think, lead us to stick our heads in the sand and not consider the very, very positive aspects that could come forth by a more responsible pathway,\u201d Daley said.\n\n\u201cScientists who go rogue ... it carries a deep, deep cost to the scientific community,\u201d Daley said.\n\nRegulators have been swift to condemn the experiment as unethical and unscientific.\n\nThe National Health Commission has ordered local officials in Guangdong province to investigate He\u2019s actions, and his employer, Southern University of Science and Technology of China, is investigating as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, Qui Renzong of the Chinese Academy of Social Science criticized the decision to let He speak at the conference, saying the claim \u201cshould not be on our agenda\u201d until it has been reviewed by independent experts. Whether He violated reproductive medicine laws in China has been unclear; Qui contends that it did, but said, \u201cthe problem is, there\u2019s no penalty.\u201d\n\nHe called on the United Nations to convene a meeting to discuss heritable gene editing to promote international agreement on when it might be OK.\n\nMeanwhile, more American scientists said they had contact with He and were aware of or suspected what he was doing.\n\nDr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics researcher at Stanford University, where He did postdoctoral research, said He told him in February that he intended to try human gene editing. Porteus said he discouraged He and told him \u201cthat it was irresponsible, that he could risk the entire field of gene editing by doing this in a cavalier fashion.\u201d\n\nDr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford ethicist, said he has \u201cspent many hours\u201d talking with He over the last two years about situations where gene editing might be appropriate.\n\n\u201cI knew his early work. I knew where he was heading,\u201d Hurlbut said. When he saw He four or five weeks ago, He did not say he had tried or achieved pregnancy with edited embryos but \u201cI strongly suspected\u201d it, Hurlbut said.\n\n\u201cI disagree with the notion of stepping out of the general consensus of the scientific community,\u201d Hurlbut said. If the science is not considered ready or safe enough, \u201cit\u2019s going to create misunderstanding, discordance and distrust.\u201d\n\nJennifer Doudna and David Liu are paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports AP\u2019s Health & Science Department."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Chinese Scientist Faces Firestorm Over Genetic Editing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-scientist-faces-firestorm-over-genetic-editing/4677805.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "A Chinese researcher has publicly defended his claim he has created the world's first genetically-edited babies.\n\nHe Jiankui addressed a crowd of fellow scientists Wednesday at a biomedical conference in Hong Kong, two days after he posted a video online claiming to have used a gene-editing technology dubbed CRISPR to alter the DNA of twin girls born to an HIV-positive father to prevent them from contracting the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nDr. He said he conducted his research in secret.

Facebook launched the service in January with six cities and expanded that to 25, then more. On Wednesday, \u201cToday In\u201d is expanding to 400 cities in the U.S. \u2014 and a few others in Australia.\n\nThe move comes as Facebook tries to shake off its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and elections-meddling and rather a place for communities and people to come together and stay informed.\n\nHere are some things to know about this effort, and why it matters:\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt's something users have asked for, the company says. Think of it as an evolution of a \u201ctrending\u201d feature the company dropped earlier this year. That feature, which showed news articles that were popular among users, but was rife with such problems as fake news and accusations of bias.\n\nAnthea Watson Strong, product manager for local news and community information, said her team learned from the problems with that feature.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply the mistakes of our foremothers and forefathers,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time around, Facebook employees went to some of the cities they were launching in and met with users. They tried to predict problems by doing \u201cpre-mortem\u201d assessments, she said. That is, instead of a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d where engineers dissect what went wrong after the fact, they tried to anticipate how people might misuse a feature \u2014 for financial gain, for example.\n\nFacebook isn't saying how long it has been taking this \u201cpre-mortem\u201d approach, though the practice isn't unique to the company. Nonetheless, it's a significant step given that many of Facebook's current problems stem from its failure to foresee how bad actors might co-opt the service.\n\nFacebook also hopes the feature's slow rollout will prevent problems.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo find out if \u201cToday In\u201d is available in your city or town, tap the \u201cmenu\u201d icon with the three horizontal lines. Then scroll down until you see it. If you want, you can choose to see the local updates directly in your news feed.\n\nFor now, the company is offering this only in small and mid-sized cities such as Conroe, Texas, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Large cities such as New York or Los Angeles have added challenges, such as an abundance of news and information, and may need to be broken up into smaller neighborhoods.\n\nThe posts in \u201cToday In\u201d are curated by artificial intelligence; there is no human involvement. The service aggregates posts from the Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. For this reason, a kid couldn't declare a snow day, because \u201cToday In\u201d relies on the school's official page. Discussion posts from local Facebook groups may also be included.\n\nFor now, the information is tailored only by geography, but this might change. A person with no kids, for example, might not want to see updates from schools.\n\nSafeguards?\n\n\n\nFacebook uses software filters to weed out objectionable content, just as it does on people's regular news feed. But the filters are turned up for \u201cToday In.\u201d If a good friend posts something a bit objectionable, you are still likely to see it because Facebook takes your friendship into account. But \u201cToday In\u201d posts aren't coming from your friends, so Facebook is more likely to keep it out.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Porsche Shows off New Edition of Mainstay 911 Sports Car", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/porsche-shows-off-new-edition-of-mainstay-911-sports-car/4678158.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Porsche says its future is in electric cars but for now it is rolling out a more powerful version of its internal combustion mainstay, the sleek 911 sports car.\n\nStuttgart-based Porsche, part of Volkswagen, is to show off the eighth version of its brand-defining model at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\n\n\nThe new 911 doesn't look much different than earlier editions of the car.

The government and the provider vowed to implement changes to avoid a repeat of the event, but the system failure demonstrated a need for greater redundancy and preparation for future natural and technological disasters.\n\nThe fire affected customers of KT, the nation\u2019s second largest telecommunications company. They found themselves unable to make calls, access the internet, complete ATM or credit card transactions, and watch television. Local media also reported an elderly woman died when she fell ill and her husband wasn\u2019t able to reach emergency services during the service outage.\n\nLee Manjong, chairman of the Korean Association for Terrorism Studies and professor of the department of Law & Police at Howon University, told VOA that while it is nearly impossible to prevent widespread system outages, certain steps can be taken to avoid catastrophic failures.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to split the public safety net (fire, medical, and police emergency services) and make system backups (redundancies) compulsory,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the blaze, South Korea\u2019s minister of Science and ICT (Information, Communications, and Technology), You Young-min, spoke to the CEOs of South Korea\u2019s three major communication companies (SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+) to discuss their backup plans.\n\nYou said the companies \u201cneed to swiftly change their contract clauses on compensation issues and also need to come up with plans that would reroute traffic if such accidents, which shouldn\u2019t happen again, happen.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for specifics on what steps the government planned on taking to prevent a similar event in the future, the ministry declined to offer specifics, stating that responsible parties would prepare fire prevention measures this year and set up a task force to implement recommendations.\n\nLocal broadcaster MBC also reported that telecommunication companies and the government held a 20-minute virtual natural disaster drill in May to simulate a system outage, but the simulation proved to be ineffective in real-world situations.\n\nInterconnected services\n\nThe Seoul fire and resulting system outage demonstrated how interconnected services are in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIf a network is down, then it affects other networks such as finance, power, energy, and railway,\u201d said Lee.\n\nHe said there are multiple ways the electronic infrastructure can be paralyzed.

This type of attack floods a computer network with incoming data packets and overwhelms the system, effectively shutting it down.

KT has announced it would compensate affected customers by awarding them a free month of service for their inconvenience. KB security expects that amount to total about $27.5 million.\n\nIn a text message to customers, KT said it was \u201cdeeply sorry for the inconvenience.

The government has reportedly denied the family\u2019s asylum request and approved them for deportation \u2015 even though there\u2019s a law in place that allows children who have lived in the country for over five years to be eligible for a residence permit, if they also fulfill other requirements. The Tamrazyans applied for a permit under that law and were denied, according to the church.\n\nKnowing that Dutch law prevents police officers from entering houses of worship during religious services, church members decided to hold a nonstop worship service at Bethel, a church and community center in The Hague. This meant that the Tamrazyans would be able to take shelter in the church.\n\nThe continuous worship service started on Oct. 26 at 1:30 p.m. \u2015 and it hasn\u2019t stopped since.\n\n\u201cThe family is in the building continuously.

The family learned in September that the government was planning to deport them. The Tamrazyans reportedly took shelter in a church in Katwijk. When that living arrangement became tenuous, the Protestant Church The Hague agreed to take over and help the family move to Bethel. As a result, the Tamrazyans now have the backing of Netherlands\u2019 largest Protestant denomination.\n\nBethel has a rotating array of about 400 ministers and lay people coming to help conduct the services. They\u2019ve also invited supporters in the community to attend services and help with groceries. The church says about 3,500 visitors from all over the Netherlands have come to Bethel to help support the Tamrazyans.\n\nAttendees of the church\u2019s services range from two people in the middle of the night to about 100 on Sunday mornings, Hettema said. The Tamrazyans attend the church service or stay in a private room in the church building.\n\nIn a press release, church leaders said it respects court orders but finds itself in a \u201cdilemma\u201d \u2015 \u201cthe choice between respecting the government and protecting the rights of a child.\u201d\n\nLeaders said they wanted to engage in a dialogue with politicians about the family\u2019s asylum request and about the Netherlands\u2019 treatment of child asylum-seekers looking to get residence permits.\n\nAdvocacy groups claim there are at least 400 other cases of child asylum-seekers who have been living in the Netherlands for over five years, the BBC reports.\n\nHettema said this phenomenon of churches opening their doors to protect refugees is not at all uncommon in the Netherlands \u2015 he claims it\u2019s happened at least 52 times. But in the past, he said, a continuous church service wasn\u2019t required to prevent police entry \u2015 which has made the Tamrazyans\u2019 case \u201cmuch harder.\u201d\n\nStill, Hettema said the church plans to continue offering the family sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWe plan to continue the services as long as our aim, to create time and space for a dialogue on the life of this family and the fate of children in similar circumstances is supported,\u201d Hettema said. \u201cAt the moment, we do not know how long the church service will take.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe act [out] of compassion and from a motivation to live like responsible civilians of our state, who care for others and remind the government to their responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the meantime, worship at the church continues.\n\nVanavond in het #kerkasielBethel (met mijn verkouden basstem als extra bonus): pic.twitter.com/x45CGxxAxC \u2014 Axel Wicke (@elziax) November 26, 2018"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Hundreds Protest In Tunisia Against Saudi Crown Prince's Visit", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protest-tunisia-mohammed-bin-salman_us_5bfd6752e4b03b230fa73fac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Tunisians protested on Tuesday against a visit by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince, denouncing the top Saudi royal as a murderer in the second straight day of demonstrations condemning the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir to the throne of the world\u2019s top oil exporter, departed from Cairo on Tuesday and was expected in Tunis in the late afternoon on a tour of Arab states that has also taken him to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, at Riyadh\u2019s consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago has strained Saudi Arabia\u2019s ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed\u2019s image abroad.\n\nSaudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder.

It reveals that Mueller is keenly focused on whether Americans close to the Trump campaign had any foreknowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to release hacked material during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe document\u2019s contents were first reported by NBC News, and a copy of it was posted online by The Washington Post. Corsi told The Associated Press on Tuesday evening that the document had been provided to his attorney by Mueller\u2019s team. Stone has denied knowing about WikiLeaks plans\u2019 ahead of time. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nCorsi said the document, which mirrors similar ones filed by Mueller in previous plea deals, contains portions of emails he exchanged with Stone in the summer of 2016 about WikiLeaks. But he denied that he intentionally lied to investigators about the emails, and said that was why he rejected the plea offer, which would have charged him with one count of making false statements.\n\n\u201cI did not ever willfully and knowingly give them false information,\u201d Corsi said. He said he forgot about the emails in question during his first interview with Mueller\u2019s team, noting they were among 60,000 contained on the laptop he provided to the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\nAccording to the document, the emails were exchanged in late July and early August of 2016, more than two months before WikiLeaks published thousands of emails stolen from the private email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn late July 2016, the document shows, Stone emailed Corsi, asking him to get in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been living in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London since 2012. Stone said he wanted Corsi to try to obtain emails the group possessed about Clinton. The document says Corsi passed Stone\u2019s request to an \u201coverseas individual,\u201d whom Corsi identified as Ted Malloch, a London-based academic who has said he was also questioned by Mueller. And on Aug. 2, 2016, the document quotes Corsi\u2019s response to Stone.\n\n\u201cWord is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I\u2019m back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging,\u201d wrote Corsi, who was in Europe at the time. He then told Stone it was time for Podesta to \u201cbe exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC,\u201d a reference to Clinton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Corsi told the AP that the email he sent Stone \u2014 which accurately forecast that WikiLeaks would release derogatory information about Podesta in October \u2014 was based on his own deduction and not the result of any inside information or a source close to the group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a guess. That email \u2014 \u2018word is\u2019 \u2014 is 100 percent speculation on my part, a package so that Roger\u2019s not going to dismiss it because I\u2019m real sure I\u2019m right,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that he has never had contact with Assange and that he didn\u2019t obtain any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans.\n\nCorsi said he disclosed to investigators \u2014 including Mueller team members Jeannie Rhee, Aaron Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein \u2014 that he had told Stone that Assange had Podesta emails. \u201cBut I maintained and still do that I figured it out,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI made it sound maybe like I had a source, but I didn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t think Stone ever believed me.\u201d\n\nCorsi said the prosecutors wouldn\u2019t believe him, thinking he was trying to protect Stone. And he believes he was threatened with a felony charge \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t give them what they wanted\u201d by connecting Stone to WikiLeaks.\n\nCorsi said he also believes the plea offer was extended to prevent him from speaking publicly about his contact with Mueller\u2019s team. He said he doesn\u2019t know if Mueller will now follow through with charging him. The last time his attorney, David Gray, heard from Mueller\u2019s team was on Monday after he had publicly rejected the deal.\n\nAccording to Corsi, they told Gray: \u201cWe\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Donald Trump Shares Meme Showing Obama, Clintons Behind Bars For Treason", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-treason-meme_us_5bfea872e4b0d23c2138ba19", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump went on a retweeting spree Wednesday, sharing posts to his Twitter account that targeted his most prominent critics, including one meme that suggested former President Barack Obama and the Clintons should be thrown in jail for treason.\n\nAfter unleashing yet another attack on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, which he likened to the \u201cMcCarthy Era\u201d of anti-communist hysteria, Trump shared tweets bashing several of his political foes, including the one he most often rants about: Hillary Clinton.\n\nOne tweet, originally shared by a fan account called \u201cThe Trump Train,\u201d shows the Clintons, Obama and Mueller all behind bars.

On one hand, social media has allowed demand for inclusivity to spread quickly and broadly \u2015 increasingly, the people in media and on runways more closely reflect what consumers and audiences actually look like. It has never been easier to find and follow people on social media who advocate for self-love and inspire their audiences to do the same.\n\nBut the internet can also be, to put it mildly, a hellscape. Those who have made a career of being open and vulnerable with their followers about issues of body image and activism are no doubt familiar with the vitriol and bad behavior that come from trolls.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what being on the receiving end of that kind of hate \u2015 and that kind of love! \u2015 might feel like to a person who promotes inclusion and advocates for self-love. So we reached out to those very people to find out.\n\nBelow, eight women who blog, model, write, advocate and are making a difference in their communities and beyond talk about what putting themselves out there on the web really looks and feels like \u2015 the good, the bad and the downright outrageous.\n\nLaura Delarato, sex educator, writer and creator of The Comments Project\n\n\u201cI do have to take breaks from social media \u2014 my DMs get way too filled with trolls telling me that I\u2019m destroying women, promoting obesity, and that I should kill myself all because I don\u2019t hate my body. That hurts, and it feels very isolating in the heat of someone else\u2019s visceral anger. When that happens, I find ways to use it to promote my art and my experience; taking breaks from posting when I can. But [commenters] never stop me from living the life that I want and being the person I desperately needed to see as an insecure, bulimic teen. They make a case for me to do more, work more, be more.\n\nFor every hate message I get, I\u2019m flooded with kind words and beautiful messages from women who are inspired by what I post and my story. That, to me, is worth more than any troll with a grudge. I will always stand by my decision to be super open and forthcoming on my social media. It allowed me to be the person I needed to see when I was younger and, in turn, make other women feel comfortable exploring their body, their emotions, their sexuality, their trauma. And that is the biggest pay off of it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a hard time with online bullies since middle school, and it\u2019s never actually gotten better. Now that I\u2019m older, with a platform to openly be a bigger model, it\u2019s a lot easier for strangers to bully, humiliate and harass me. I\u2019m afraid to Google my own name because of websites dedicated to hating people who look like me, made by fat-phobic and racist people.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve broken down so many times from seeing so much hate spread about me. There were many times when I thought leaving online would make everything better, but it won\u2019t. The career I am fighting for requires me to be active both on and offline. I feel alone and defeated a lot, but I keep pushing because I know how important what I am doing is for people who are still battling loving themselves and gives them hope in the modeling and fashion world. There will be people who do not like you for God knows whatever reason but you can\u2019t let strangers be the reason you give up. You can\u2019t let anyone or anything be a reason why you give up.\u201d\n\nJane Belfry, founder and creative director of The Thicc\n\n\u201cBeing a woman on the internet is terrible in general. For my own sanity, I chose to make my personal Instagram and Twitter private after launching The Thicc so that the brand lives on its own and is more about a collective conversation about destigmatizing our bodies, experiences, mental health and beauty, and not just my own personal experiences with those things.\n\nThough I feel that my own vulnerability has inspired others to contribute, whether it\u2019s writing or posing for me in front of the camera. We get dozens of messages a week from people saying that the content is helping them feel beautiful and seen, or helping their eating disorder recovery, or the content they wish they\u2019d seen when they were younger. Those are the positives, that\u2019s why I created it. We don\u2019t have a lot of trolls at this point, but I did and do get quite a few comments on my personal account, most popularly: \u2018You\u2019re not \u201cThicc\u201d you\u2019re fat,\u2019 which... OK? These comments used to be incredibly jarring, now I scroll through the weirdo DMs and say, in the words of Ariana Grande, \u2018Thank u, next.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve learned throughout my body-positive journey is that hurt people hurt people. Those negative comments come from people who are miserable; they hate themselves and they cannot stand to see someone, especially someone who\u2019s loving themselves despite antiquated societal norms, so they lash out.\n\nPeople who are happy and love themselves have no desire to hurt others, so any negative message or comment I get just alerts me to how sad and miserable that commenter is. But they\u2019ll never get me to engage in their sad behavior; I just delete, block and move on. I can typically tell if it\u2019s going to be something hateful from the first couple of words. I don\u2019t even bother reading their entire comment \u2015 not worth my time! At the end of the day, I don\u2019t care if there are people who don\u2019t like what I do or how I look or even the sheer fact that I\u2019m satisfied with myself. I may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I don\u2019t want everyone to drink me anyway \u2015 it would leave me drained.\u201d\n\nSarah Chiwaya, editor and blogger at Curvily Fashion\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a shy person, but there is definitely something substantively different about putting yourself out there online. I started my blog because seeing other stylish, confident, happy plus-size women had such an immense impact on my own self-confidence, and I once I realized just how much representation matters, I wanted to be a part of that.\n\nUnfortunately, many people feel way too free to be a dick online, especially if anyone is bucking deeply entrenched biases or outdated norms. As a plus blogger who focuses on body positivity, I get this all too often. A lot of the trolling is from furious feminist-hating dudes who love to simultaneously insult and objectify women who don\u2019t fit their idea of a perfect female body. For the most part, I can just delete and block these types of disgusting comments and move on, but occasionally it piles up and can just feel like too much.\n\nAnother variety of negative comment I tend to get is from other plus women who have so completely internalized their fat-phobia that they feel like they need to be enforcers of it. These comments often go something like, \u2018As a plus-size woman, I know what is flattering, and I would never wear [stripes/a sleeveless shirt/a bikini/sequins/a crop top/etc., etc., etc.]!!!\u2019 These ones are both annoying and sad, because when I was deep in my own body loathing, I had the same thoughts. My life is much happier and my wardrobe is exponentially better now, so hopefully they can make it to the other side too, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to hold their hand throughout the process if they are exceptionally rude about it.\n\nBut the comments that take the biggest toll on me are actually the ones that aren\u2019t trolling at all, but are outright objectifying and sexualizing me. The comments with the tongue emoji always make me want to hurl. I make it clear that I am posting for people looking for fashion inspiration and representation, and actively block dudes that send creepy DMs and dick pics, but the comments just keep coming. Fortunately, the upside of being able to positively impact people well outweighs the negatives, but I just wish more people would keep in mind that there is a real person who has to read and process the gross and mean things they type. Keep your hatred and objectification to yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you are 100 percent unapologetically yourself, putting yourself out there on the internet can be a struggle. People will always judge and have something nasty to say, but if you know you are being true to yourself, it becomes easier to deal with negativity, as it\u2019s just other people\u2019s insecurity.\n\nOne image I posted of myself in pajamas \u2015 very comfy and happy \u2015 got 800 hateful comments, mostly from male fitness bloggers saying I was a fat pig who should be slaughtered, that I had put them off their dinner with how grotesque I was. I later found out I was put on a blog and targeted. I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t upset at the time, but little did these trolls know their targeted attack caused my Instagram to reach a huge engagement and I went up 10,000 followers from the exposure. Their hate helped me gain new supporters, so who is the real winner now?\u201d\n\nAnastasia Garcia, photographer and advisory board member for Consider The Image\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy exposing yourself to countless people. Especially when it comes to revealing very personal truths about your own body. In the beginning it was really scary. As a photographer, my role is to let my work speak and to remain quiet. For a long time I thought that I couldn\u2019t speak up, because it would discredit my perception as a professional photographer. But the more I spoke up about my experiences, the more positive responses I got. I\u2019ve found that being honest about my experiences and my journey has helped me connect to, and inspire others who have gone through the similar body issues. I thought I was alone, but the honest truth is most women hate their bodies, and that is a symptom of an exclusive fashion, and media industry that doesn\u2019t celebrate a diverse range of women.\n\nSo for the most part, my experience putting myself out there has been a really positive one. I mean, sure, I\u2019ve had my fair share of trolls, and mean people. One of my clients is a plus-size lingerie company, and after a shoot they gifted me some of the lingerie we had shot. I loved the pieces, and felt so sexy wearing them. I ended up posting some photos of myself in lingerie \u2014 and my client reposted on it their Instagram. The very first comment on the image was from a guy who said, \u2018This is not sexy. She is too fat to be wearing this.\u2019\n\nIn most professions people don\u2019t enter the workplace exposed to everyone with a social media account, and most professionals don\u2019t have to worry about their body jeopardizing their work or the sales of their client. Thankfully my client was supportive. They sent me a lovely email and deleted the man\u2019s comment right away. But the fact still remains that man\u2019s comment could have jeopardized my future work with that company. Beyond embarrassing me, he could impacted my professional work.\n\nI also always get a constant flow of \u201cfit girls\u201d reaching out to me asking if I\u2019d like to participate in their weight-loss programs, or expressing \u201cconcern for my health,\u201d or the select few people claiming that my photography promotes obesity and unhealthy lifestyles.

Because reactors require 720 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of electricity they produce, they could be vulnerable to changes in water availability due to climate change.\n\nCall it the nuclear power industry\u2019s thirst trap.\n\nThe United States\u2019 aging fleet of nuclear reactors \u2015 responsible for one-fifth of the country\u2019s electricity and most of its low-carbon power \u2015 has never been more necessary as policymakers scramble to shrink planet-warming emissions. Yet the plants are struggling to stay afloat, with six stations shut down in the last five years and an additional 16 reactors scheduled to close over the next decade. So far, new coal- and gas-burning facilities are replacing them.\n\nThe nuclear industry blames high maintenance costs, competition from cheaper alternatives and hostile regulators concerned about radiation disasters like the 2012 Fukushima meltdown in Japan. But the country\u2019s most water-intensive source of electricity faces what could be an even bigger problem as climate change increases the risk of drought and taxes already crumbling water infrastructure.\n\nThat finding, highlighted in the landmark climate change report that the Trump administration released with apparent reluctance last Friday, illustrates the complex and at times paradoxical realities of anthropogenic, or human-caused, warming. It also stokes an already hot debate over the role nuclear energy should play in fighting global warming, a month after United Nations scientists warned that carbon dioxide emissions must be halved in the next 12 years to avoid cataclysmic climate change leading to at least $54 trillion in damage.\n\nThe report \u2015 the second installment of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated update on the causes and effects of anthropogenic warming from 13 federal agencies \u2015 devoted its entire third chapter to water contamination and depletion. Aging, deteriorating infrastructure means \u201cwater systems face considerable risk even without anticipated future climate changes,\u201d the report states. But warming-linked droughts and drastic changes in seasonal precipitation \u201cwill add to the stress on water supplies and adversely impact water supply.\u201d\n\nNearly every sector of the economy is susceptible to water system changes. And utilities are particularly at risk. In the fourth chapter, the report\u2019s roughly 300 authors conclude, \u201cMost U.S. power plants \u2026 rely on a steady supply of water for cooling, and operations are expected to be affected by changes in water availability and temperature increases.\u201d\n\nFor nuclear plants, that warning is particularly grave. Reactors require 720 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of electricity they produce, according to data from the National Energy Technology Laboratory in West Virginia cited in 2012 by the magazine New Scientist. That compares with the roughly 500 gallons coal requires and 190 gallons natural gas needs to produce the same amount of electricity. Solar plants, by contrast, use approximately 20 gallons per megawatt-hour, mostly for cleaning equipment, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.\n\nNuclear plants are already vulnerable to drought. Federal regulations require plants to shut down if water in the river or lake that feeds its cooling drops below a certain level. By the end of the 2012 North American heat wave, nuclear generation fell to its lowest point in a decade, with plants operating at only 93 percent of capacity.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump said he doesn't believe the National Climate Assessment released Nov. 23.\n\nThe availability of water is one problem, particularly for the majority of U.S. nuclear plants located far from the coasts and dependent on freshwater. Another is the temperature of the water that\u2019s available.\n\nNearly half the nuclear plants in the U.S. use once-through cooling systems, meaning they draw water from a local source, cool their reactors, then discharge the warmed water into another part of the river, lake, aquifer or ocean. Environmental regulations bar plants from releasing used water back into nature above certain temperatures. In recent years, regulators in states like New York and California rejected plant operators\u2019 requests to pull more water from local rivers, essentially mandating the installation of costly closed-loop systems that cool and reuse cooling water.\n\nIn 2012, Connecticut\u2019s lone nuclear power plant shut down one of its two units because the seawater used to cool the plant was too warm. The heat wave that struck Europe this summer forced utilities to scale back electricity production at nuclear plants in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. In France the utility EDF shut down four reactors in one day.\n\n\u201cAlready they\u2019re having trouble competing against natural gas and renewable energy,\u201d said John Rogers, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cAdd onto that high water temperatures, high air temperatures and drought. It\u2019s just another challenge.\u201d\n\nBut water has yet to pose an existential crisis. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that it considers climate change when reviewing applications for nuclear plants\u2019 construction or operation permits and that it has never rejected one over concerns about dwindling cooling water resources.\n\n\u201cFor plants on lakes and rivers, the basic consideration will continue to be whether or not the water level in that body is high enough to meet the conditions of the license,\u201d said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \u201cTo this point, there have been no indications in the NRC\u2019s analyses to suggest that plants would have to deal with the potential for the water bodies to no longer be able to fulfill their function.\u201d\n\nIf or when that situation arises, a plant would have to propose a plan to maintain the requirements of the license, likely by reducing water intake and cutting electricity production, he said.\n\nThere are ways to make nuclear plants more efficient with water. Closed-loop systems already cool 40 percent of the country\u2019s reactors. For more than a decade, regulators and industry players have been discussing the feasibility of air-cooled condensers, which use electricity generated by the plant to power air conditioners that cool reactors without water. But the technology siphons roughly 7 percent of the power produced by the plant and has yet to be installed at any U.S. nuclear station, according to the industry-funded Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\nEIA Expected changes in the availability of water for cooling will pose problems for plants far from the coasts.\n\nAnother approach is to use recycled water. To cool its three reactors, the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona sources most of the 20,000 gallons it uses per minute from reclaimed sewage from a treatment plant near Phoenix \u2014 a technique hailed in 2016 as \u201ca feat of engineering\u201d amid a drought.\n\nBreakthroughs like that could make nuclear an attractive option for powering solutions to water scarcity in the years to come, such as desalinating brackish or saltwater and moving it to drought-parched regions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s energy intensive,\u201d said Matt Wald, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute. \u201cIf you want to do that without adding carbon emissions, you\u2019re likely to look at nuclear power as a way to do that.\u201d\n\nThat, however, gets to the heart of the biggest question looming over the nuclear industry: Is it, given the radioactive waste it produces, clean energy?\n\nFor the growing number of states and municipalities pledging to use 100 percent renewable energy by the middle of the century, the answer is maybe.\n\nHawaii became the first state to adopt a 100 percent renewable electricity rule in 2015, pledging to quit gas and coal by 2045. The law makes no mention of nuclear, probably because the archipelago state has no reactors and requires a minimum two-thirds vote from both houses of the legislature to approve the construction of a nuclear plant or radioactive waste site.\n\nThe 100 percent clean electricity bill that California passed in August mandates that the state generate 60 percent of its electricity from renewables like wind and solar by 2030. But it gives regulators another 15 years after that to complete the overhaul with energy sources considered nonrenewable, including nuclear power, large hydropower dams and gas-fired power plants that capture and store emissions.\n\nA statute that Atlanta passed in June to get the city to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 is vague, listing nuclear as a source of clean energy but vowing to get all its power from renewables.\n\nFor the Sierra Club, the environmental giant making a huge push to get cities and states to go all renewable, nuclear power is \u201ca uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity\u201d and \u201cno solution to climate change.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "'Proud' Chinese Geneticist Says Another Baby-Gene Editing Volunteer Is Pregnant", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/he-jiankui-gene-editing-proud_us_5bfe5871e4b0d23c2137faff", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist at the center of an ethical storm over what he claims are the world\u2019s first genetically edited babies said on Wednesday he is proud of his work and revealed that another volunteer is pregnant as part of the research.\n\nHe Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cFor this case, I feel proud.

Stone Jr. released documents on Tuesday showing that as the presidential campaign heated up in the summer of 2016, Mr. Stone tried to dispatch him to find out what information WikiLeaks had that could prove damaging to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe associate, Jerome Corsi, said in an interview that he might be indicted on a charge of lying to federal investigators because he told them that he refused Mr. Stone\u2019s request when in fact he passed it on to an intermediary. He said he had refused a plea deal offered by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, because he did not intentionally lie, but merely forgot events of more than two years ago.\n\nMr. Corsi\u2019s dealings with Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors have caused alarm among the president\u2019s legal team, who were informed of developments by Mr. Corsi\u2019s lawyer. President Trump\u2019s lawyers were especially troubled by a draft statement of offense against Mr. Corsi that was passed on to them, according to people familiar with the situation. In it, prosecutors claimed that Mr. Corsi understood that Mr. Stone was \u201cin regular contact with senior members of the Trump campaign, including with then-candidate Donald J. Trump\u201d when he asked Mr. Corsi in late July 2016 to \u201cget to\u201d Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.\n\nThe reference to Mr. Trump coincided with other events that so disturbed the president\u2019s lawyers that they delayed turning in his responses to written questions after negotiating over them with the special counsel for nearly a year. At roughly the same time, the Justice Department inadvertently released a secret criminal complaint against Mr. Assange and Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team learned that prosecutors were accusing Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, of lying. Only after Mr. Mueller\u2019s team reassured Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers that they were not trying to lure the president into a trap did they forward his answers on Nov. 20."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Trump Lobs Insults at Special Counsel One Day After Prosecutors Say Manafort Lied", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/us/politics/trump-mueller-manafort.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Corsi, a conspiracy theorist and friend of Roger J.
