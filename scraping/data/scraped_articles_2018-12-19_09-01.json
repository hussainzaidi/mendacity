Mueller's filings make it clear, despite Trump's claims, there were contacts with Russians. And he has been indirectly implicated in a campaign finance crimes involving hush payments to women he lied about.\n\nIn many ways, Tuesday's developments simply thickened the cloud of suspicion and legal peril that has engulfed all aspects of Trump's personal, political and business life.\n\nAnd they indicate that while Trump's rhetorical assaults on the FBI and Mueller may fly on conspiratorial conservative media and with his core political support, they are prone to dissolve in the reality-based situation of a courtroom.\n\n'I am not hiding my disgust'\n\nJUST WATCHED White House argues Flynn's crimes have 'nothing to do' with Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White House argues Flynn's crimes have 'nothing to do' with Trump 03:27\n\nIn Tuesday's hearing, Judge Emmet Sullivan repeatedly stressed the gravity of Flynn's crimes. He originally and mistakenly said that Flynn had worked as an unregistered agent for the Turkish government during his brief tenure at the White House, saying such behavior was arguably tantamount to selling his country out.\n\nHe later corrected himself to reflect the fact that Flynn's undisclosed lobbying for Turkey ended before he joined the White House in January 2017. But Flynn was on Turkey's payroll while he advised Trump during the campaign. The contract ended while Flynn was a senior member on Trump's transition team.\n\nThere was no mistaking the judge's attitude towards the former general's conduct.\n\n\"I am not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense,\" Sullivan said.\n\nSolomon Wisenberg, a former deputy counsel in the Clinton-era Whitewater affair, told CNN that Sullivan decided not to ignore the larger political reality around the case framed by the President's attacks on the administration of justice.\n\n\"The idea that his comments have not been affected by the President of the United States and his campaign of vilification is far fetched,\" Wisenberg said.\n\n\"He is affected by that and I think it is proper for him to take that into consideration in terms of what he publicly says,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's sentencing proceedings for Flynn was expected to be a routine affair since Mueller had requested he serve no jail time for lying to the FBI, given his \"substantial\" cooperation with the Russia probe.\n\nHeading into the hearing, Trump and his supporters were touting a story that Flynn was a victim and not a criminal, maintaining that he was railroaded by the FBI when questioned about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\n\nBefore the court sat, Trump tweeted good luck to Flynn and claimed he had been under \"tremendous pressure\" from federal authorities.\n\nGood luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2018\n\nBut Sullivan appeared to take exception to such arguments, since he required Flynn to state clearly in court that he was standing by his guilty plea. His move followed a filing by Flynn's lawyers last week in which they complained that their client had been pressed by then then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe not to have a lawyer present during his FBI interview.\n\nSullivan asked Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner if his client was \"entrapped\" by the FBI and the attorney replied: \"No, your honor.\"\n\n\"Are you continuing to accept responsibility for his false statements?\" Sullivan asked, before Flynn broke in with the words: \"I am, your honor.\"\n\n\"I would like to proceed, your honor,\" Flynn said in a later exchange.\n\n\"Because you're guilty of this offense?\" Sullivan asked.\n\n\"Yes, your honor,\" Flynn replied.\n\nFlynn, a career US government servant and military officer who rose to head the Defense Intelligence Agency, also told the court that he knew that lying to the FBI was a crime when he did it.\n\nTuesday's hearing came a day after the release of a Mueller memo detailing Flynn's interview with FBI agents in which the then-national security adviser lied about his contact during the presidential transition in 2016 with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe official court document also shows no evidence that there was any attempt to entrap Flynn or sense that his rights were being violated.\n\nThe message did not reach the White House, which stuck to outdated talking points contradicted by the facts. In a rare press briefing, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders kept faith with her boss' alternative universe.\n\nShe stood by a previous statement that the FBI had \"ambushed\" Flynn and broken protocol by not conducting the interview in the presence of a lawyer and used the White House podium to launch a new attack on the law enforcement agencies of which the President is the titular head.\n\n\"We don't have any reason to walk that back,\" she said, while distancing the President from any lies told by Flynn.\n\nAt the end of Tuesday's hearing, Flynn and his lawyers agreed to a delay in his sentencing until March, after apparently concluding that the judge, who was deeply perturbed by Flynn's crimes, intended to send him to jail.\n\nThat grace period will allow Flynn even more time to add to his 19 meetings with Mueller's team -- a further flashing danger sign for Trump emerging out of Tuesday's events.\n\nThere is, so far, no public evidence that Trump either ordered Flynn to lie or directed the contents of his conversations, on issues including Russian sanctions and a vote on Israeli settlements at the UN, with Kislyak.\n\nIf the President ends up being accused of cooperating with Russia in election meddling or obstructing justice, after asking FBI chief James Comey to go easy on Flynn, and then firing Comey, he will have a chance to mount a formal defense.\n\nBut there is still no answer as to why Flynn, who spent months at Trump's side, chose to lie to the FBI about his chats with the ambassador of a state that he knew had been accused by US intelligence of meddling in the election.\n\nThat riddle may have to await Mueller's final report.\n\nCharity as check book\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump closing family charity amid NY AG lawsuit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump closing family charity amid NY AG lawsuit 02:51\n\nAs is often the case for Trump, bad news came on several fronts Tuesday.\n\nHis personal charitable foundation agreed to dissolve in the face of claims that the President and his three eldest children -- Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric -- violated campaign finance laws and abused its tax-exempt status.\n\nInstead of operating a genuine charity, the lawsuit alleged, the family allowed it to be used \"as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the lawsuit that is to continue, New York state is seeking $2.8 million in restitution, plus penalties, and a ban on Trump and his children serving on the board of any other New York nonprofit.\n\n\"It is extraordinary,\" Anne Milgram, a former New Jersey attorney general, told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\n\"What the AG is saying is that they have failed in the fiduciary duties to the non profit organization in such an enormous way that they are not qualified to sit on the board of any non profit or charity in the state of New York.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Flynn sentencing delayed after judge's blistering rebuke", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nNKR3zq5-LY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "But after almost two dramatic hours in a courtroom discussing his crimes, he asked to postpone his sentencing for several months so he can have more of an opportunity to cooperate in federal investigations and attempt to mitigate the judge's disgust with his actions.\n\n\"I want to be frank with you, this crime is very serious,\" federal Judge Emmet Sullivan said in the courtroom Tuesday. \"Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\"\n\nFlynn, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to FBI agents in a January 24, 2017, interview in the West Wing of the White House, told the judge on Tuesday \"I was aware\" that lying to the FBI was a crime. He said he accepted responsibility for his actions.\n\nProsecutors from special counsel Robert Mueller's office had asked the judge to give Flynn little to no jail time because he had cooperated extensively with them and in at least one other investigation, a case in Virginia against Flynn's former business associates in which they are accused of illegally lobbying for Turkey. Prosecutors said Tuesday that Flynn had already given the \"vast majority of cooperation\" the judge should consider for his sentence but it was possible he could still help in other prosecutorial actions.\n\nBut Sullivan, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, veered the sentencing hearing off its course.\n\nAfter formally accepting Flynn's guilty plea, the judge threw a series of questions at him that highlighted how unusual Flynn's case is and how consequential his actions may be.\n\nDid Flynn believe he was not guilty? Did he think he was entrapped by the FBI when they interviewed him without a defense attorney present? Had Mueller's team considered charging Flynn with other crimes, including treason?\n\nFlynn and the lawyers' answers to all of these questions were no.\n\nYet Sullivan pressed on, his voice growing more shrill as he discussed Flynn's actions.\n\nFlynn lied even \"in the presence of the White House,\" Sullivan added. \"You can't minimize that.\"\n\n\"I am not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense,\" Sullivan said, pausing between each statement. \"Yes, your honor,\" Flynn said. He was not asked a question.\n\nAt one point, Sullivan wrongly suggested Flynn had acted as an illegal agent of a foreign government while serving as national security adviser. \"That undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably, you sold your country out,\" Sullivan said. Later, the judge walked that comment back, acknowledging that Flynn's unregistered lobbying for the Turkish government ended in November 2016, while Flynn worked on the Trump campaign and transition and before they took the White House.\n\nAs much of the hearing unfolded and the tension in the room grew, there was little obvious reaction from members of the Flynn family, some of whom have embraced and amplified unfounded claims of FBI misconduct on their social media accounts. Many of them sat in the front row of the courtroom, and when the judge rhetorically asked if his \"treason\" implication was incorrect, some of Flynn's supporters loudly said, \"Yes.\"\n\nBefore the hearing, about a dozen family members and friends present had appeared to be in a good mood, with Flynn even telling his supporters as he entered the courtroom, \"You made it.\"\n\nTrump himself had wished Flynn \"good luck\" in a Tuesday morning tweet, adding that it \"will be interesting to see what he has to say.\"\n\nGood luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2018\n\nFollowing Sullivan's courtroom reprimands Tuesday, Flynn took a break to meet privately with his attorneys. When they returned to the courtroom, Flynn's legal team told the judge they'd like more time before his sentencing.\n\nBoth sides now have until March 13 to file a status report with the court. Flynn's sentencing date has not been rescheduled, and will likely not happen until there is a conclusion in the separate federal criminal case in Virginia, in which his lobbying partner has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFlynn left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. Security guards ushered him to a waiting car as ralliers and protesters chanted \"USA, USA.\"\n\nSullivan ordered Flynn to stay within 50 miles of Washington and to surrender his passport. The judge said he was imposing the restrictions because they were typical for defendants released on personal recognizance but he had just learned Flynn had not been under such a restriction. Sullivan said the restriction starts January 4 and he was approving already-planned international travel that the court had been informed about.\n\nAfter the hearing, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dug in on the entrapment accusation.\n\n\"The FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed Gen. Flynn and in the way that they questioned him and in the way that they encouraged not to have White House counsel's office present,\" she said at the White House press briefing.\n\nA key Mueller witness\n\nOver the past year, Flynn has given Mueller a key witness on some of the most scrutinized moments during the Trump campaign, transition and first month in the White House -- while also turning the former Army lieutenant general into a political cause backed by conservatives wary of Mueller's approach. \"Nothing has been held back\" during the cooperation sessions, Flynn's defense lawyer told the court on Tuesday.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty last December to one count of lying to the FBI. In his January 2017 interview with two FBI agents, he downplayed the substance of his interactions with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential transition. Flynn had in fact asked Kislyak for certain policy responses from Russia following US sanctions and before a United Nations Security Council resolution vote. Flynn also lied about his lobbying work for Turkey throughout 2016.\n\nHe barely spoke to the judge in the courtroom Tuesday, other than answering questions with two- or three-word statements.\n\nBecause his guilty plea had been accepted by a different federal judge, who then appears to have recused himself from the case, Sullivan reviewed Flynn's crimes on Tuesday and made sure Flynn still wanted to admit his guilt.\n\n\"I would like to proceed, your honor,\" Flynn said about his guilty plea. \"Because you're guilty of this offense?\" Sullivan asked. \"Yes, your honor,\" Flynn said, nodding.\n\nThree previous defendants in Mueller's probe -- Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, the Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos -- pleaded guilty to the same crime of lying. Each received sentences that included prison time, with Cohen getting two months (Cohen was also sentenced to three years in a separate case). But none of those men helped investigators as broadly, willingly or sincerely as Flynn, Mueller's team has said.\n\nSullivan, however, drew the contrast that Flynn was singular among them because of his position in the military and the administration.\n\n\"My guess was not one of those defendants was a high-ranking government official who while employed by the President of the United States ... made false statements on the premises of and in the West Wing of the White House,\" Sullivan said.\n\nAnother defendant, former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, also pleaded guilty to a lying charge in Mueller's probe. He continues to cooperate with the investigation and has no set sentencing date.\n\nThe FBI's approach\n\nFlynn's sentencing has been shaded over the past three weeks by criticism of the FBI's actions when it first approached him in the White House on January 24, 2017.\n\nFlynn's defense team first raised the issue in a memo to Sullivan last week. The defense lawyers argued that Flynn should be spared jail time because he had lied under different circumstances than van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos, who had been warned they could be prosecuted for lying to the FBI.\n\nFlynn spoke to the FBI agents with no lawyer present and hadn't been warned of the potential legal consequences. He also did not involve the White House counsel's office, and the FBI did not involve the Justice Department in his interview.\n\nFlynn was so relaxed, investigators said, that they did not have the impression that he was lying during the interview, according to memos from the agents. Even so, the FBI knew that when Flynn said he hadn't asked for certain responses from Kislyak to the American sanctions against Russia or a United Nations Security Council resolution, he was lying.\n\nTuesday, Sullivan asked Flynn's attorneys if the former national security adviser was \"entrapped by the FBI.\" His defense lawyer said, \"No, your honor.\"\n\nAnother FBI memo about the January 24, 2017, interview, released Monday night, further solidified that Flynn wrongly denied he had tried to influence the Russian government's reaction to sanctions and intentions at the UN.\n\nFlynn first met Kislyak in 2013 while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he had developed the relationship with the Russian government since then. Court documents made public last year show that members of Trump's transition team knew about Flynn's requests to the ambassador a month before the inauguration.\n\nFlynn is also central to the potential obstruction of justice case surrounding Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey. According to a memo Comey wrote in February 2017, the President asked him to drop the investigation into Flynn.\n\nMueller's team has described on multiple occasions how Flynn misled members of the Trump administration about his contacts with Kislyak, which then prompted those public officials to share false information with the American public.\n\n'Could he have been charged with treason?'\n\nSullivan stunned the courtroom when he asked if Flynn conduct \"rises to the level of treasonous activity.\"\n\nProsecutor Brandon Van Grack, speaking for the special counsel's office, said prosecutors did not consider charging Flynn with treason.\n\nSullivan asked again: \"Could he have been charged with treason?\"\n\nLater, the judge walked back his treason questions. \"I'm not suggesting\" Flynn committed treason, he said.\n\n\"I was just trying to determine the benefit and the generosity of the government,\" he said. \"Don't read too much into the questions I ask.\"\n\nBut then, as an aside, Sullivan commented how much he disagreed with the no-jail-time sentence of former Gen. David Petraeus , who shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in 2015 and served two years on probation. He also was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.\n\nSullivan's closing words to the courtroom were: \"Happy holidays.\"\n\nTurkey project\n\nAside from Flynn's conversations with the Russian, he admitted to lying about his lobbying work for the Turkish government as it sought to build American support for the extradition of a cleric and political opponent living in Pennsylvania.\n\nFlynn's two former business associates were indicted by the Justice Department on Monday for working on this project, which included Flynn authoring an op-ed in a Washington newspaper that sympathized with the current Turkish government and demonized the cleric. The op-ed published on Election Day 2016. The former business associates also accepted payments for the work through Flynn's company, the Flynn Intel Group, according to the charging document.\n\nOne of the men, Flynn Intel Group co-founder Bijan Rafiekian, also known as Bijan Kian, appeared in a Virginia courtroom Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and illegally acting as a foreign agent in the US.\n\nThe other defendant in the case, a Dutch-Turkish businessman, is charged with the same two crimes plus lying to the FBI. The businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, lives in Istanbul and has not appeared in US court.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Michael Isikoff: Judge sent chill down Flynn's spine", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/S0MHJENGzgs/donad-trump-michael-flynn-sot-michael-isikoff-cuomo-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Yahoo News' Michael Isikoff, who was in the room for the hearing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, describes the reaction in the courtroom to the judge who will decide whether Flynn will get jail time."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump Foundation agrees to dissolve under court supervision", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/bRvp5s_a_B8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's personal charitable foundation has agreed to dissolve under judicial supervision amid an ongoing lawsuit concerning its finances, according to a document filed Tuesday in Manhattan Supreme Court by the New York state Attorney General's office.\n\nThe dissolution of the Donald J.

A vote on Pittsburgh's proposed measures is not expected until early next year.\n\nErika Strassburger, city council member for the Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the synagogue shooting took place, said Monday that the effort shouldn't be seen solely as a reaction to the deaths at Tree of Life.\n\n\"Although that provided the momentum, this shouldn't be seen as a response to that event,\" she said.\n\nStrassburger said the proposed laws were a response to \"decades and decades of gun violence\" in Pittsburgh and an \"epidemic of suicide\" nationwide.\n\n\"We acknowledge that there have been efforts at the federal level and by state lawmakers to amend our firearms laws,\" she said. \"In light of those efforts going nowhere, we felt the need to take action on the local level.\"\n\nAmong the weapons that would be banned are any rifles with a pistol grip, folding stock and detachable magazine. The legislation specifically bans several AR-15 style weapons by name.

I want my witnesses to have a chance to tell what they saw,\" she said in a letter to her attorney.\n\nLawyers who handle sexual misconduct allegations said plea deals are common in such cases, and cautioned against rushing to judgment without knowing the context for the outcome.\n\nBut because the case never went to trial, the public may never fully understand the state of evidence that led to the outcome -- and that's more concerning to some lawyers than the actual plea bargain that spared the former fraternity president jail time or sex offender registration.\n\nJacob Walter Anderson was indicted on four counts of sexual assault in 2016 based on allegations that he drugged and raped a 19-year-old sophomore at a fraternity party. In her victim impact statement, the woman accused Anderson of forcing himself on her repeatedly as she blacked out and then leaving her unconscious \"face down in the dirt.\"\n\nAnderson's lawyers released a statement on Friday saying they had never seen a case with so many misrepresentations of what occurred. They said the encounter was consensual and called the victim's claims that he choked her and left her for dead \"fabrications\" that she only reported two years after the incident. Her lawyer did not return a request for a response to the defense statement.\n\nAnderson was expelled from Baylor after a campus Title IX investigation, a university spokeswoman said. While a student at the University of Texas at Dallas , he pleaded no contest in October to a lesser charge of unlawful restraint in an agreement with the McLennan County District Attorney's office.\n\nIn exchange for his plea, Anderson was offered deferred adjudication probation -- meaning he won't spend a day in jail, and his record will be expunged in three years if he pays a $400 fine and submits to psychological, alcohol and drug treatment. Judge Ralph Strother approved the plea last week in state court in Waco, sparking criticism that the outcome was too lenient given the allegations.\n\nThe news prompted an online petition calling on UTD to remove him from campus, followed by the school's announcement that it was banning an unnamed student fitting his profile from commencement activities.\n\nOutgoing District Attorney Abelino \"Abel\" Reyna stood by the outcome, saying the plea \"achieved the best result possible with the evidence at hand.\" His office declined to comment for this story.\n\nMcLennan County district attorney Abel Reyna retires at the end of the year.\n\nWithout a trial to lay out all the evidence for a jury to scrutinize, the public is wont to jump to conclusions -- especially in a case with such a wide disparity between the alleged conduct and the severity of the punishment, said defense attorney Gloria Allred. She is not affiliated with the case, but she has represented sexual assault accusers in high-profile cases, including Bill Cosby's accusers.\n\nMore troubling, Allred and other lawyers said, is the victim's claim that the district attorney's office never consulted her regarding the plea, and why the prosecutor told her she offered the plea.\n\nAllred worries that the outcome will deter crime victims from coming forward when victim cooperation is critical to successful prosecutions.\n\n\"Nobody can require a prosecutor to take a case to trial. Nor can they prevent (a prosecutor) from taking a case to trial,\" she said. \"But there seems to be such a disconnect between what the victim said happened and the sentence that naturally the public is going to have a lot of questions, and it's not helpful when we don't know the evidence.\"\n\nHere's what lawyers who spoke to CNN urged the public to keep in mind when evaluating plea bargains in sexual assault cases.\n\nWhy a case might end in a plea to lesser charges\n\nPlea bargains for reduced sentences are common in sexual assault cases, said the president of the national Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, and five defense lawyers who spoke with CNN.\n\nSuch cases can be tough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, they said -- especially when they lack witnesses or corroborating evidence, or if they hinge on consent.\n\nCleveland-based lawyers Susan Stone and Kristina Supler specialize in student disciplinary matters and Title IX investigations. They represent students and professors accused of misconduct as partners and co-chairs of Kohrman Jackson & Krantz Education Law and Student Defense Practice Group.\n\nStone called Anderson's case a \"thoroughly typical\" example of how criminal cases proceed through the system.\n\n\"The reality is, on a regular basis, cases are charged with various offenses, felonies and misdemeanors, and through the process in the legal system, charges are amended and the parties agree to a plea,\" she said. \"What I can tell you is, rarely a case ends the way it is charged.\"\n\nThe nature of sexual assault allegations tends to elicit an emotional response from the public that's hard to set aside, Supler said. But when a prosecutor offers a plea deal or declines to press charges, it's usually because they don't believe they have sufficient evidence to convince a jury of a defendant's guilt -- and the public is not privy to everything the prosecutor knows.\n\n\"What a lot of people who are not lawyers may have a hard time understanding is that, when there is a plea, it's because there are problems with the evidence and the prosecutors can't prosecute their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nProsecutors in the Baylor case indicated there were possible evidence problems. Assistant District Attorney Hilary LaBorde wrote in a letter to the victim and her parents that \"conflicting evidence and statements\" in Anderson's case made \"the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\"Any lawyer can issue a statement, but taking a statement and proving the truth of its contents beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, when a complaining witness is subject to cross examination, is a different task entirely,\" she said in a separate statement after the plea was accepted.\n\n\"Given the claims made publicly, I understand why people are upset. However, all of the facts must be considered and there are many facts that the public does not have. In approving this agreement, Judge Strother had access to all the statements that have ever been made by all people involved and agreed that the plea agreement offered was appropriate in this case.\"\n\nCNN legal analyst Mark Geragos said it's hard for him to believe that a prosecutor would \"give away\" a viable case in the era of #MeToo, when sexual misconduct allegations are being taken more seriously than in previous years. He urged those who are critical of the judge to consider that the district attorney's office made the offer in the first place.\n\n\"If a prosecutor made the offer, either she's completely out of touch or she realized there are problems with the proof in their case,\" he said.\n\nLittle to no jail time is common for first-time offenders\n\nThe victim in the case decried the plea for shielding Anderson from time in custody, alleging that he may continue to prey on women.\n\n\"Jacob Anderson will most likely rape again. He is now free to roam society, stalk women and no one will know he is a sex offender. Jacob Anderson and all rapists who get away with their crimes will never be cured, never change. If anything they will be emboldened by their power over women and their ability to escape justice and punishment,\" she said in her victim impact statement.\n\nBut little to no jail time is common for first-time offenders who have had no prior contact with the criminal justice system, said the lawyers who spoke with CNN.\n\nWhen prosecutors consider charges, they look at the evidence and whether they can prove the allegations, said David LaBahn, president and CEO of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Then, prosecutors look at the offender to determine the outcome that will balance justice for victims with long-term goals such as public safety and reducing the likelihood of reoffending, he said.\n\nState District Court Judge Ralph Strother accepted a plea agreement by former Baylor University fraternity president Jacob Anderson.\n\nFor first-time offenders who are not considered imminent threats to the public, prosecutors and judges are encouraged to consider alternatives to incarceration, such as treatment or diversionary programs, in the hopes that their first offense will be their last, LaBahn said.\n\nWith detention centers overcrowded, he said, imprisonment should be reserved for society's most dangerous offenders and the focus should be on rehabilitating offenders to end the cycle of violence.\n\n\"You cannot arrest, prosecute and jail yourself out of criminal justice problems ... you need to address the cause,\" he said. \"If you can address the cause, you reduce the criminality, but until you address the cause, the criminality is going to continue.\"\n\nWhat about the victim's rights?\n\nMore concerning than the plea itself, LaBahn said, is the victim's claim that the district attorney's office did not consult her before offering it to Anderson. Most states, including Texas , have a victims' bill of rights enshrined in state law, which affords them the opportunity to be notified about decisions regarding an offender.\n\n\"It's hard to know whether a result is proper or not without knowing the specific context,\" he said.\n\n\"But the treatment of the victim, that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe victim and her family learned about the plea deal in the media, a fact the prosecutor in the case later apologized for in a letter to them. But the victim was unassuaged.\n\n\"I have been waiting two and a half years for this trial. I have been through hell and back and my life has been forever turned upside down. I feel like I should have the right to the trial for the four counts of sexual assault the grand jury indicted him on,\" she wrote her lawyer.\n\n\"She (the prosecutor) has not kept me informed and has not discussed the plea with me at any time, other than to say she would not offer him one. I was furious and devastated when I read the newspaper article that she was basically dropping the sexual assault charges. And then in utter shock when her reason was because she lost a completely different case so she didn't trust a jury to do the right thing.\"\n\nIn her letter, prosecutor LaBorde said that a jury's verdict of not guilty in another rape case influenced her decision. She said the jury in the previous trial \"engaged in a lot of victim blaming,\" treatment that she thought the victim in Anderson's case would also experience because the behavior of the two victims was similar.\n\n\"It's my opinion that our jurors aren't ready to blame rapists and not victims when there isn't concrete proof of more than one victim. I have had success in trying college aged defendants yes, but in retrospect, ONLY when they have multiple victims,\" she wrote. \"Multiple victims put the focus properly on the criminal's conduct. That didn't happen when there was only one victim and one event to talk about.\"\n\nThough it's not clear exactly which similarities she was referring to, in the previous case against a defendant named Hunter Morgan, the victim had the defendant's DNA in her underwear and injuries to her genitals, LaBorde wrote. In Anderson's case, his lawyers said no DNA evidence links him to the incident.\n\nIn her letter, LaBorde also referred to the strength of the medical evidence regarding the injuries the victim experienced as a virgin, saying her injuries were more likely to be explained away because such injuries are common when someone has her first sexual encounter.\n\n\"The research suggests that victims with no sexual experience are more likely to be injured because a sexual encounter is their first,\" LaBorde wrote. \"So medically speaking, (this victim's) innocence and lack of experience makes the medical evidence less helpful.\"\n\nLaBorde also raised differences between the defendants that she thought might make a jury more sympathetic to Anderson.\n\n\"I actually thought the Hunter Morgan case was stronger than Jacob Anderson's because Morgan admitted the victim was intoxicated, too intoxicated to consent, and he admitted he wasn't intoxicated at all,\" she wrote. \"One weakness I've always identified with Anderson is that he was drinking also -- and although I think he's exaggerating -- he acts as though he was extremely intoxicated at the time he was at the frat party.\"\n\nThe decision to not go to trial\n\nAllred said the leniency Anderson experienced was \"more of the same\" in a criminal justice system that gives defendants in sexual assault cases the benefit of the doubt over the accuser.\n\nThe prosecutor's statements about why she chose not to go to trial show how the system has failed to keep up with the cultural reckoning prompted by #MeToo, Allred said.\n\nAllred acknowledged that proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt is an uphill battle. But she questioned the prosecutor making her decision to not try the case based on past outcomes, she said, because each case is different.\n\nAnd if past jurors have shown a tendency to blame victims, she said, it's a prosecutor's job to call witnesses and present evidence to dispel myths about how victims behave after experiencing a traumatic event.\n\n\"There's only one way we're going be able to move forward, and that's if juries are educated on what to expect from a victim,\" she said. \"That's a better alternative than saying, 'We can't go to trial because they may blame her or shame her.'\"\n\nThe victim shared similar concerns in her letter to her lawyer.\n\n\"This is the reason rape victims hesitate to report the crime. I had the courage to report the crime, go through an investigation, wait all these years to testify I have had to courage to keep on living so that I can testify.\"\n\nAnderson's case drew comparisons to the trial of former Stanford University athlete Brock Turner, who spent three months behind bars after a judge went against a prosecutor's recommendation for a harsher sentence. In Turner's case, it was clear that the sentence was \"awful but lawful,\" LaBahn said, because evidence and witness testimony was presented in open court. But in Anderson's case, the truth is less clear, he said.\n\nEven when the evidence isn't so clear cut, LaBahn said there's merit to bringing a case to a grand jury or to trial if it's what the victim wants: It allows them to have their day in court.\n\n\"I would like this not to become a situation where others don't report based on the outcome of this case,\" he said. \"Each case is different, and we really do need the victim's involvement.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Judge sentences poacher to year in jail -- and makes him watch Bambi monthly", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/tpsYVugYcy0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Missouri judge is turning to Walt Disney to make sure David Berry Jr. never illegally hunts again.\n\nBerry's sentencing is the latest event in one of the state's largest poaching cases.\n\nLawrence County Judge Robert George sentenced Berry to a year in jail for illegally killing deer, taking only their heads and antlers and leaving the rest of their bodies to rot.

But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nChristina Zayas was paid to post about Juul on her Instagram. The post has now been deleted.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The bill that wouldn't die: The unlikely story behind the criminal justice overhaul", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/2aoPvGe5Ukg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) On the afternoon of September 5, President Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office debating whether to throw his support behind the most extensive overhaul of prison and sentencing laws in years.\n\nAcross the room, an unlikely group of allies tried to persuade him to join them. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- the driving force behind the effort -- had invited the liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones and celebrity Kim Kardashian West to the White House for an impromptu meeting.\n\nBut first they had to deal with one problem that had been bothering the President for weeks: Willie Horton.\n\nHorton, a convicted murderer who raped a woman after he was granted a weekend furlough from prison in Massachusetts, was the subject of a withering 1988 presidential campaign ad attacking the Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor at the time. The ad, which exploited racist stereotypes, was devastating to Dukakis, and Trump was worried that he could suffer his own Willie Horton moment in 2020 if he backed the bill -- a fear stoked by Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chief congressional opponent of the effort.\n\n\"He was afraid,\" Jones said of the President. \"He was concerned someone would get out, hurt someone and that would be the end of his political career.\"\n\nJones, a CNN host and commentator, and Kardashian West sought to imprint the name of another convicted felon in Trump's mind: Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been serving a life sentence for money laundering and a nonviolent drug offense until Trump granted her clemency in June to broad acclaim. Every time Trump mentioned Horton, Jones and Kardashian West reminded him of Johnson.\n\n\"We just kind of circled back, Van and I, in talking to the President to explain: But you have Alice now, and Alice is your legacy,\" Kardashian West, who had helped convince Trump last spring to commute Johnson's sentence, told CNN. \"She really opened up his heart and his eyes.\"\n\nThe half-hour meeting was just one of several pivotal moments that ultimately led Trump to endorse a groundbreaking prison and sentencing overhaul bill last month, ramping up pressure on a reluctant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who has doomed similar efforts in the past -- to bring it to the floor for a vote\n\nOn Tuesday night, Congress passed the bill 87 to 12. Trump is expected to sign it this week before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort. The effort cements what is so far the biggest bipartisan victory of his presidency and turns the page on decades of policies that critics say were brutal, racist, ineffective and costly.\n\nThe timing is particularly noteworthy given that it comes as nearly every aspect of the President's political and business life is under investigation, and substantive congressional policy making has practically ground to a halt.\n\nThe bill's passage is also a win for Kushner, whom the bill's supporters credit with working behind the scenes to steer the legislation past significant opposition within the Trump administration and past shifting coalitions on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis story, based on interviews with more than a dozen administration officials, members of Congress, and advocates and opponents of the legislation, tracks the winding journey to push the bill, known as the First Step Act, through Congress to the desk of a President who campaigned on the promise of renewing tough-on-crime policies.\n\nAt times the bill seemed poised to fail. Yet at crucial moments a surprising political alliance emerged to keep it alive, one made up of social progressives, black Democrats, members of the religious right, fiscal conservatives and libertarians. The effort has proved so resilient this time around, opponents have dubbed the First Step Act the \"zombie bill\" for its refusal to die.\n\nJared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, discusses US Mideast policy, prison reform, and what it's like working for President Donald Trump with CNN's Van Jones at the CITIZEN by CNN forum in New York.\n\nUnder the legislation, thousands of federal inmates will be able to leave prison earlier than they otherwise would have. Many could secure an earlier release thanks to new credits awarded for good behavior or through participation in rehabilitation programs. The bill also eases some mandatory minimum sentences, gives judges more leeway to eschew certain sentencing guidelines and eliminates \"stacking\" provisions that leave offenders serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed with firearms.\n\n\"If this bill is the only step Congress takes, it will leave the important work of criminal justice reform substantially undone,\" said Ames C. Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. \"But as a real 'first step,' the bill both changes the conversation -- focusing on how we reduce federal prison sentences, not whether we do it at all -- and offers a real, immediate benefit for currently incarcerated people.\"\n\nA Democratic blockade\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries didn't want to be seen at the White House.\n\nThe New York Democrat represents parts of Brooklyn, one of the most anti-Trump districts in the country, and he was wary about the message his presence at the White House would send. So in the spring, when Kushner asked Jeffries to meet him at his office in the West Wing, he and Rep. Cedric Richmond, the Louisiana Democrat who's the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, refused. Instead, on March 22, Kushner came to them on Capitol Hill for breakfast. Jeffries, who had been working with Richmond on overhauling the criminal justice system for years, saw it as an early sign that Kushner was serious about the issue.\n\nStill, there was deep skepticism among Democrats. Many were averse to delivering Trump a win, and felt that simply being on the same side of an issue as the President was politically dangerous, particularly given his heated rhetoric over policing and inner city crime.\n\nIn 2016, Trump repeatedly spoke about bringing back controversial police practices, like stop and frisk, that disproportionately impact black and Latino men. When Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, said he would boycott Trump's inauguration in 2017, Trump tweeted in response that the civil rights icon \"should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.\"\n\nBut over months of meetings and calls with Kushner, Jeffries warmed to the idea that a criminal justice overhaul might be feasible under Trump. He found Kushner to be \"authentically committed\" and spent time talking with the President's son-in-law about the personal connection he had to the issue.\n\nKushner's father, Charles, served 14 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. Jeffries also found a willing cosponsor across the aisle in Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, a pastor who had seen his state's criminal justice overhaul efforts work to reduce recidivism rates.\n\nYet a difficult path lay ahead. First, Jeffries had to deal with critics in his own party.\n\nOn May 17, the Collins-Jeffries bill drew a fiery rebuke from some of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party, including Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The trio wrote a letter laying out the bill's faults as they saw them, including its lack of any sentencing revisions. The American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and other progressive groups opposed the bill.\n\nKushner offered to get involved but Jeffries insisted on handling it himself, according to Jones. In a day, Jeffries and his staffers wrote a point-by-point rebuttal to that letter while listening to the title tracks of one of the most famous rap battles, Jay-Z's \"Takeover\" and Nas' \"Ether.\" As they worked, Jeffries blasted the music on speakers in his office, according to an aide.\n\nThe next week, Jeffries stood up in a private House Democratic caucus meeting to defend his bill from the opposition of House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler of New York, former Attorney General Eric Holder and other powerful Democrats. \"What I recall is that Rep. Jeffries knew the bill in depth; answered questions fully; and removed the doubts of some completely,\" said Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California.\n\nA few days later, the bill passed the House with 360 votes, including nearly 70% of the House Democratic caucus and almost every Republican voting in favor of it.\n\n\"It's clear that some elements on the hard-left unleashed everything, including the kitchen sink, to try to stop the criminal justice reform effort in the House based on the worldview of all or nothing,\" Jeffries told CNN. \"In the House, we took the position that in order to break the back of the prison industrial complex we needed to begin with a significant, robust bipartisan effort around prison reform that could lay the foundation to get something done.\"\n\nAdministration opposition\n\nAs Jeffries was dealing with skeptical Democrats, Kushner was fighting with Republican opponents in the Trump administration, most notably then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nIn initial drafts, Sessions and his aides at the Justice Department worked to insert provisions that advocates of the bill considered \"poison pills,\" including introducing a new mandatory minimum sentence -- drawing uproar from Kushner's new Democratic partners, who questioned whether the political risk of associating with the White House would be worth it.\n\n\"Jared and others at the White House who were working on this went to bat for us,\" said Jessica Jackson Sloan, who along with Jones co-founded #Cut50, a group that advocates for reducing incarceration in the US. \"Jared said, 'I'm going to make sure this is right and I'm not going to let this crap happen again.' \"\n\n\"That was huge,\" Jones said.\n\nWithin weeks, Jones returned the favor by appearing alongside Kushner at a May 18 White House event focused on the prison legislation. Just walking into the Trump White House, Jones said, felt like \"political suicide.\" He and others who appeared onstage were assailed as \"Uncle Toms\" on social media.\n\n\"They didn't really understand why we were going,\" said Topeka Sam, a former felon who attended the White House event. \"The way we looked at it was, it's our house and despite who's in there, it's our country. And if we're looking to change what's happening to our people that are incarcerated, that we need to be at the table.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See Kanye and Trump's full White House meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See Kanye and Trump's full White House meeting 19:47\n\nBut the event offered proof of the bipartisan union that was coming together -- with left- and right-leaning advocates in attendance. It was also an indication that Trump was edging in favor of the bill.\n\nSeated in the front row of the gold-trimmed East Room, Mark Holden, senior vice president of Koch Industries, which has long advocated for criminal justice revisions, watched as Trump strayed from the teleprompter to make an off-script point about how a friend had hired some former prisoners who had turned out to be \"superstars.\" \"They would have never gotten the chance,\" said Trump.\n\nTo Holden and several administration officials, the riff was a sign that Trump wasn't just going through the motions. He was in. It was also a notable affront to Sessions, who was also seated in the front row.\n\nAround the time of the event, Sessions attended a meeting at the White House with Trump, Kushner and Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- another longtime advocate of criminal justice revisions. Sessions came armed with a memorandum laying out his arguments against the bill. But he didn't get far before Trump shut him down, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nIt didn't help that by then, Sessions had become a regular target of Trump's ire over his recusal from the Russia investigation. The mere fact that Sessions opposed the effort was almost enough to make the President support it.\n\n\"Trump liked the idea of overruling Sessions,\" said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAfter getting his hair cut at the Senate barbershop Tuesday, Sessions declined to talk to CNN about the First Step Act on the record.\n\nAugust setback\n\nBy August, momentum was building behind the bill.\n\nEarly that month, the President huddled at his Bedminster golf club with a group of Republican governors supportive of a criminal justice overhaul. There -- as he would in the Oval Office a month later -- Trump raised his concerns that he could face a Willie Horton moment of his own if he backed a bill that would grant early release to some convicted felons. The governors, a senior administration official said, helped assuage Trump's concern and pointed him to the benefit of sentencing overhauls in their states.\n\nBut then -- just as supporters of the bill expected a presidential endorsement was afoot -- Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, managed to get face time with Trump while he was at the White House, reviving the President's fears of Horton and reminding him of the political danger of endorsing the bill. That same day, McConnell told Trump the prison overhaul bill was too divisive among Republicans to bring to a vote before the midterm elections, multiple sources familiar with the call told CNN.\n\nUnder pressure, Trump agreed to table the issue until after the midterms.\n\nJUST WATCHED Jared Kushner full interview with Van Jones Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jared Kushner full interview with Van Jones 43:44\n\n\"At that point, we thought everything had died,\" said Jones.\n\nKushner extracted a promise from McConnell to bring the bill to a vote after the midterms if a whip count showed they had the votes. The delay gave supporters a chance to regroup and expand their coalition. Kushner began calling Sen. Mike Lee of Utah so frequently that when he interrupted Lee's family dinner during a vacation in Canada, they knew who it was. \"My family said, 'Oh it's Jared, isn't it?' \" Lee recalled.\n\nTo gain the backing of law enforcement groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police, and National District Attorneys Associations, supporters offered a few key concessions, including one that excludes people convicted of certain fentanyl-related offenses from being eligible for early release. That helped undercut the position of Cotton and other opponents, and positioned Kushner to present a strengthened bill to the President.\n\nMcConnell boxed in\n\nOn November 14, Trump delivered his endorsement in the White House Roosevelt Room, giving shout-outs to a number of Republican senators who wrote the revised bill -- Chuck Grassley , Lindsey Graham, Lee, Tim Scott, Rand Paul -- and Rep. Collins, an original co-author.\n\nBy then, most Senate Democrats had also jumped on board after some key sentencing provisions were added, including one that Senate Democratic Whip Durbin fought for in 2010 that reduced the disparity between sentences for powder vs. crack cocaine. The new legislation will apply that change retroactively to about 2,600 inmates who had been convicted under the previous statute.\n\nThere was still just one problem: McConnell was dragging his feet . The day after Trump gave his endorsement, the Senate majority leader told Trump in the Oval Office that he would not bring the measure up for a vote until next year, two administration officials said, pushing the careful compromise into the pit of divided government just as Democrats regain control of the House. Advocates were worried that decision could kill the bill, just as McConnell's reluctance to bring up a previous Senate bill sponsored by his whip, Sen. John Cornyn, and others stifled another effort at the end of the Obama administration.\n\nKushner and his allies began to ramp up pressure on McConnell. Conservatives flooded his office with calls, including thousands organized by the conservative grassroots group FreedomWorks, which also mounted a pressure campaign in Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn's home state of Texas.\n\nMcConnell needed to \"hear from everyone who matters to him and that the cost to him of not doing this was going to be greater\" than moving forward, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Trump put on the pressure, urging McConnell several times over the phone to bring the bill to the floor. And while some urged the President to attack McConnell on Twitter, Kushner convinced him to hold his fire, trusting McConnell would ultimately relent.\n\nLee unleashed\n\nBy the end of the month, Cornyn's office was telling the White House they didn't have the votes, claiming support for the bill was softer than it appeared, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nEven after Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House legislative affairs team did their own whip count and concluded they had over 60 votes, McConnell still wouldn't commit to bringing the bill to a vote before the end of the year. So Lee went into overdrive, lobbying his fellow senators day and night, by phone, by text, in person on the Senate floor, at lunch in the Senate cafeteria. \"I went nuts,\" Lee told CNN.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Lee's friend, the conservative Republican Sen.

Scott called McConnell to shower him with praise.\n\n\"I told him, 'We're going to build statues of you in the hood,' \" Scott recalled.\n\nA week later, on the day the bill passed the Senate, Jones and Kushner had an early-morning phone call to coordinate their efforts.\n\n\"The next 48 hours are critical,\" Jones jokingly told Kushner, echoing a phrase he had heard from Kushner at the end of nearly every one of their calls.\n\nBut the goal line was actually much closer, Kushner replied. \"I actually think it's only the next 12,\" he said.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Freedomworks is no longer associated with the Koch family."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Michael Flynn sentencing postponed after dramatic hearing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nNKR3zq5-LY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "But after almost two dramatic hours in a courtroom discussing his crimes, he asked to postpone his sentencing for several months so he can have more of an opportunity to cooperate in federal investigations and attempt to mitigate the judge's disgust with his actions.\n\n\"I want to be frank with you, this crime is very serious,\" federal Judge Emmet Sullivan said in the courtroom Tuesday. \"Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\"\n\nFlynn, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to FBI agents in a January 24, 2017, interview in the West Wing of the White House, told the judge on Tuesday \"I was aware\" that lying to the FBI was a crime. He said he accepted responsibility for his actions.\n\nProsecutors from special counsel Robert Mueller's office had asked the judge to give Flynn little to no jail time because he had cooperated extensively with them and in at least one other investigation, a case in Virginia against Flynn's former business associates in which they are accused of illegally lobbying for Turkey. Prosecutors said Tuesday that Flynn had already given the \"vast majority of cooperation\" the judge should consider for his sentence but it was possible he could still help in other prosecutorial actions.\n\nBut Sullivan, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, veered the sentencing hearing off its course.\n\nAfter formally accepting Flynn's guilty plea, the judge threw a series of questions at him that highlighted how unusual Flynn's case is and how consequential his actions may be.\n\nDid Flynn believe he was not guilty? Did he think he was entrapped by the FBI when they interviewed him without a defense attorney present? Had Mueller's team considered charging Flynn with other crimes, including treason?\n\nFlynn and the lawyers' answers to all of these questions were no.\n\nYet Sullivan pressed on, his voice growing more shrill as he discussed Flynn's actions.\n\nFlynn lied even \"in the presence of the White House,\" Sullivan added. \"You can't minimize that.\"\n\n\"I am not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense,\" Sullivan said, pausing between each statement. \"Yes, your honor,\" Flynn said. He was not asked a question.\n\nAt one point, Sullivan wrongly suggested Flynn had acted as an illegal agent of a foreign government while serving as national security adviser. \"That undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably, you sold your country out,\" Sullivan said. Later, the judge walked that comment back, acknowledging that Flynn's unregistered lobbying for the Turkish government ended in November 2016, while Flynn worked on the Trump campaign and transition and before they took the White House.\n\nAs much of the hearing unfolded and the tension in the room grew, there was little obvious reaction from members of the Flynn family, some of whom have embraced and amplified unfounded claims of FBI misconduct on their social media accounts. Many of them sat in the front row of the courtroom, and when the judge rhetorically asked if his \"treason\" implication was incorrect, some of Flynn's supporters loudly said, \"Yes.\"\n\nBefore the hearing, about a dozen family members and friends present had appeared to be in a good mood, with Flynn even telling his supporters as he entered the courtroom, \"You made it.\"\n\nTrump himself had wished Flynn \"good luck\" in a Tuesday morning tweet, adding that it \"will be interesting to see what he has to say.\"\n\nGood luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2018\n\nFollowing Sullivan's courtroom reprimands Tuesday, Flynn took a break to meet privately with his attorneys. When they returned to the courtroom, Flynn's legal team told the judge they'd like more time before his sentencing.\n\nBoth sides now have until March 13 to file a status report with the court. Flynn's sentencing date has not been rescheduled, and will likely not happen until there is a conclusion in the separate federal criminal case in Virginia, in which his lobbying partner has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFlynn left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. Security guards ushered him to a waiting car as ralliers and protesters chanted \"USA, USA.\"\n\nSullivan ordered Flynn to stay within 50 miles of Washington and to surrender his passport. The judge said he was imposing the restrictions because they were typical for defendants released on personal recognizance but he had just learned Flynn had not been under such a restriction. Sullivan said the restriction starts January 4 and he was approving already-planned international travel that the court had been informed about.\n\nAfter the hearing, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dug in on the entrapment accusation.\n\n\"The FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed Gen. Flynn and in the way that they questioned him and in the way that they encouraged not to have White House counsel's office present,\" she said at the White House press briefing.\n\nA key Mueller witness\n\nOver the past year, Flynn has given Mueller a key witness on some of the most scrutinized moments during the Trump campaign, transition and first month in the White House -- while also turning the former Army lieutenant general into a political cause backed by conservatives wary of Mueller's approach. \"Nothing has been held back\" during the cooperation sessions, Flynn's defense lawyer told the court on Tuesday.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty last December to one count of lying to the FBI. In his January 2017 interview with two FBI agents, he downplayed the substance of his interactions with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential transition. Flynn had in fact asked Kislyak for certain policy responses from Russia following US sanctions and before a United Nations Security Council resolution vote. Flynn also lied about his lobbying work for Turkey throughout 2016.\n\nHe barely spoke to the judge in the courtroom Tuesday, other than answering questions with two- or three-word statements.\n\nBecause his guilty plea had been accepted by a different federal judge, who then appears to have recused himself from the case, Sullivan reviewed Flynn's crimes on Tuesday and made sure Flynn still wanted to admit his guilt.\n\n\"I would like to proceed, your honor,\" Flynn said about his guilty plea. \"Because you're guilty of this offense?\" Sullivan asked. \"Yes, your honor,\" Flynn said, nodding.\n\nThree previous defendants in Mueller's probe -- Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, the Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos -- pleaded guilty to the same crime of lying. Each received sentences that included prison time, with Cohen getting two months (Cohen was also sentenced to three years in a separate case). But none of those men helped investigators as broadly, willingly or sincerely as Flynn, Mueller's team has said.\n\nSullivan, however, drew the contrast that Flynn was singular among them because of his position in the military and the administration.\n\n\"My guess was not one of those defendants was a high-ranking government official who while employed by the President of the United States ... made false statements on the premises of and in the West Wing of the White House,\" Sullivan said.\n\nAnother defendant, former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, also pleaded guilty to a lying charge in Mueller's probe. He continues to cooperate with the investigation and has no set sentencing date.\n\nThe FBI's approach\n\nFlynn's sentencing has been shaded over the past three weeks by criticism of the FBI's actions when it first approached him in the White House on January 24, 2017.\n\nFlynn's defense team first raised the issue in a memo to Sullivan last week. The defense lawyers argued that Flynn should be spared jail time because he had lied under different circumstances than van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos, who had been warned they could be prosecuted for lying to the FBI.\n\nFlynn spoke to the FBI agents with no lawyer present and hadn't been warned of the potential legal consequences. He also did not involve the White House counsel's office, and the FBI did not involve the Justice Department in his interview.\n\nFlynn was so relaxed, investigators said, that they did not have the impression that he was lying during the interview, according to memos from the agents. Even so, the FBI knew that when Flynn said he hadn't asked for certain responses from Kislyak to the American sanctions against Russia or a United Nations Security Council resolution, he was lying.\n\nTuesday, Sullivan asked Flynn's attorneys if the former national security adviser was \"entrapped by the FBI.\" His defense lawyer said, \"No, your honor.\"\n\nAnother FBI memo about the January 24, 2017, interview, released Monday night, further solidified that Flynn wrongly denied he had tried to influence the Russian government's reaction to sanctions and intentions at the UN.\n\nFlynn first met Kislyak in 2013 while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he had developed the relationship with the Russian government since then. Court documents made public last year show that members of Trump's transition team knew about Flynn's requests to the ambassador a month before the inauguration.\n\nFlynn is also central to the potential obstruction of justice case surrounding Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey. According to a memo Comey wrote in February 2017, the President asked him to drop the investigation into Flynn.\n\nMueller's team has described on multiple occasions how Flynn misled members of the Trump administration about his contacts with Kislyak, which then prompted those public officials to share false information with the American public.\n\n'Could he have been charged with treason?'\n\nSullivan stunned the courtroom when he asked if Flynn conduct \"rises to the level of treasonous activity.\"\n\nProsecutor Brandon Van Grack, speaking for the special counsel's office, said prosecutors did not consider charging Flynn with treason.\n\nSullivan asked again: \"Could he have been charged with treason?\"\n\nLater, the judge walked back his treason questions. \"I'm not suggesting\" Flynn committed treason, he said.\n\n\"I was just trying to determine the benefit and the generosity of the government,\" he said. \"Don't read too much into the questions I ask.\"\n\nBut then, as an aside, Sullivan commented how much he disagreed with the no-jail-time sentence of former Gen. David Petraeus , who shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in 2015 and served two years on probation. He also was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.\n\nSullivan's closing words to the courtroom were: \"Happy holidays.\"\n\nTurkey project\n\nAside from Flynn's conversations with the Russian, he admitted to lying about his lobbying work for the Turkish government as it sought to build American support for the extradition of a cleric and political opponent living in Pennsylvania.\n\nFlynn's two former business associates were indicted by the Justice Department on Monday for working on this project, which included Flynn authoring an op-ed in a Washington newspaper that sympathized with the current Turkish government and demonized the cleric. The op-ed published on Election Day 2016. The former business associates also accepted payments for the work through Flynn's company, the Flynn Intel Group, according to the charging document.\n\nOne of the men, Flynn Intel Group co-founder Bijan Rafiekian, also known as Bijan Kian, appeared in a Virginia courtroom Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and illegally acting as a foreign agent in the US.\n\nThe other defendant in the case, a Dutch-Turkish businessman, is charged with the same two crimes plus lying to the FBI. The businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, lives in Istanbul and has not appeared in US court.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Senate Republicans drafting short-term deal to prevent government shutdown", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/xTuTBF0zzb4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Senate Republicans are drafting a stopgap spending bill to extend the funding deadline for approximately 25% of the federal government until February 8, according to three sources.\n\nThe decision to move forward on the short-term plan hasn't been finalized, the sources said.

It's not clear whether Trump has the authority to fire Powell without cause.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House again defended Trump's right to express his views, arguing it's what his supporters want from him.\n\n\"He's been very clear what his position is, while he understands that the Fed is an independent agency,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said during a briefing. \"That doesn't take away the President's right to state his opinion on a particular matter.\"\n\nYet none of those sharp criticisms appear to have deterred Powell -- or triggered a retreat from the public spotlight. On the contrary, Powell has brought \"some urgency\" to his job as the Fed-explainer-in-chief, calling it \"essential\" for the central bank to be as transparent as possible about what the central bank is doing and explaining its decisions to the American public in a way that can be easily understood.\n\n\"We are absolutely committed to serving the public in a nonpartisan, professional way, in a way that communicates what we're doing, why we're doing it, as clearly as possible,\" said Powell at a Dallas Fed event in November.\n\nHe has also proactively upped his visits to Capitol Hill, meeting with lawmakers and their staff to understand and address their concerns.\n\n\"I invest in all of those things,\" said Powell referring to his role in managing \"external relations with Congress and the administration,\" describing it as a \"very, very important part\" of his job.\n\nAnd starting in January, Powell will have an even bigger microphone to shield himself against the President's harsh criticisms when he begins a new tradition of holding eight press conferences a year following the Fed's policy-setting meetings.\n\n\"That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions,\" said Powell in June when he announced the Fed's new communication strategy.\n\nSuch defensive communication will be on full display on Wednesday when Powell will be faced with explaining to reporters his wait-and-see strategy on future rate hikes next year and how he's managing to control the economy's cockpit while under direct pressure by Trump to slow down.\n\nJan Hatzius, chief US economist for Goldman Sachs, recently wrote in a note to clients that given the \"hot-and-cold messaging\" from the committee, the press conference will be particularly important.\n\n\"We expect Powell will clear the air, acknowledging some softening in the growth outlook but also highlighting data dependence,\" Hatzius wrote.\n\nAt its final meeting, the US central bank is expected to raise rates for the fourth time this year, lifting the federal funds rate, which controls the cost of mortgages, credit cards and other borrowing to a range of 2.5% and 2.75%. Interest rates have increased six times since Trump took office. Three of those increases have been under Powell.\n\nThe President on Tuesday morning again urged central bankers to move cautiously \"before they make yet another mistake.\"\n\n\"Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers,\" Trump tweeted, adding \"Good luck!\"\n\nSitting presidents dating back to Andrew Jackson have put pressure on their central bankers to keep interest rates low.\n\nPresidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon fought with their Fed chairs. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker clashed with President Ronald Reagan's White House over suggestions he should lower rates to make it easier for them to raise taxes and close yawning deficits.\n\nEven Alan Greenspan, who was first appointed to the Fed by Reagan and became the longest-serving chairman, remaining in his role into the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview with CNN's Julia Chatterley that he wore \"ear muffs\" while he served at the helm of the Fed for nearly 20 years, adding he couldn't recall a specific instance of anyone in Congress or an administration official telling him they wanted rates to rise.\n\nWhat's unusual is the fact that Trump hasn't hesitated to unleash his fury publicly on Powell. saying he isn't even \"a little bit happy\" with him and calling his decision to raise rates a \"mistake.\"\n\nIn private, people close to Trump have said, the President has sounded unnerved by signs that the economy is shakier than he likes to suggest in public, and believes he will get the blame if things turn markedly worse. Those private misgivings have come in tandem with fury at Powell, who Trump blames for the situation.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 are on track for the worst December since 1931, in the depths of the Great Depression. All the major averages are lower for the year, making this the first down year for stock investors in a decade. And the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks is in an official bear market.\n\nWhat's more, the Dow is 1,000 points lower than when Trump signed his tax reform into law one year ago.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC on Monday, Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro rested the blame on the Fed for the recent market volatility not the President's ongoing trade war with China as a determining factor.\n\n\"We have zero inflation for all practical purposes,\" Navarro said, adding the Fed's plan to raise interest rates while also shrinking its balance sheet was \"perplexing\" for some at the White House.\n\n\"The only argument I'm hearing for the Fed to raise rates now is somehow they have to exert their independence,\" said Navarro.\n\nGreenspan, however, dismissed the idea that the Fed might cave to political pressure by the President.\n\n\"How do you know they are listening?\" Greenspan told CNN. \"I've not been aware of policy changes which were primarily driven by political considerations.

Click to subscribe!\n\n\"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,\" tweeted Trump . \"Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!\"\n\nFlynn did no such thing.\n\n\"The defendant has no intention to withdraw the guilty plea,\" said one Flynn attorney. Asked whether FBI investigators had \"entrapped\" Flynn, another member of his legal team was blunt: \"No, your Honor.\" (The Flynn legal team had suggested in a filing last week that because Flynn was questioned by FBI officials in January 2017 without a lawyer present and without being fully apprised of his full legal peril that he might qualify for additional leniency from the judge.)\n\nThose facts may wind up getting lost amid the maelstrom that followed. The judge lectured Flynn about his actions, suggested he might be a traitor before rescinding that comment and told the former national security adviser that \"not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\"\n\nAnd in the end, nothing happened.\n\nFlynn's lawyers accepted the deal offered to them by the judge to delay Flynn's sentencing until the full breadth of his cooperation with federal officials can be properly evaluated. That won't be until March.\n\nThe real news out of the hearing was that Flynn did nothing even close to backing away from his guilty plea. In fact, he agreed to keep cooperating -- in an effort to ensure that he has the best chance of avoiding prison possible. (The Mueller special counsel team has recommended that Flynn not serve any time due to his cooperation with several ongoing investigations.)\n\nFacts be damned, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had this to say about the Flynn sentencing hearing during a rare press briefing on Tuesday afternoon: \"The FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed General Flynn.\"\n\nThis is clearly the version of events Trump wants to believe. He has always, for whatever reason, had a soft spot for Flynn.\n\nRemember that, according to former FBI Director James Comey, Trump asked him to back off a federal investigation into Flynn because the former national security adviser had already suffered enough. (\"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\" Trump reportedly told Comey . \"He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\")\n\nUnlike his harsh treatment of former lawyer Michael Cohen, who Trump referred to as a \"rat\" in a recent tweet , the President has said nothing but kind things about Flynn since the latter's plea deal.\n\n\"So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday 'interrogation' with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her?\" Trump tweeted in December 2017 . \"Rigged system, or just a double standard.\"\n\nThe operative question is why? Why is Trump so vengeful toward Cohen (and his plea deal) while he is so praiseworthy of Flynn and still seems to believe that his plea deal was coerced somehow (even though Flynn said it wasn't)?\n\nHonest answer: I don't know.\n\nIt could be that Trump believes -- as he so often says -- that he is totally and completely innocent of any wrongdoing in regard to Russian interference in the 2016 election and therefore has concluded that Flynn's cooperation can't hurt him in any way, shape or form.\n\nOr, and I think this is more likely, Trump has a blind spot when it comes to the danger that Flynn's cooperation with Mueller presents the President's inner circle. To Trump, Flynn is a loyal deputy -- a guy who was with him when no one else was at the start of the presidential campaign, a guy who served his country in the military, an honorable man. And Trump thinks the honorable thing to do -- in all situations -- is to defend him no matter the costs. Hence a lack of concern about what Flynn is telling Mueller.\n\nI'd argue that aside from Cohen -- and possibly not aside from Cohen -- Flynn is the most important witness in the Mueller probe. Flynn is the only one of the seven people who have pleaded guilty who worked for the Trump campaign, the presidential transition and in the White House. That gives him a unique and longer-barrel perspective of the Russian interference attempts, and how they were met across those three phases of Trumpworld.\n\nTrump may not be able to see that big picture -- but you know who does?

On the call were representatives from the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Network of Abortion Funds\n\nThey spoke of the more than 400-and-counting restrictions to abortion access that have been enacted at the state level since 2010 and vowed that this is not a time to stop fighting. Even though Roe v. Wade remains on the books, they said, some states forge ahead as if it has been overturned.

Several mentioned a Gallup Poll from the summer that showed nearly two-thirds of Americans -- or 64% -- want to uphold the 1973 Supreme Court decision, including 41% of Republicans.\n\nSussman pointed out how three states -- Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan -- kicked out anti-abortion governors.

Aden said he's looking ahead with optimism, focusing on the legislative issues and fights that he imagines down the pipeline.\n\nSpecifically, he highlighted four model pieces of legislation his organization has written that he hopes will gain traction next year across the country.\n\nThe Abortion Reporting Act seeks to require reporting of all abortion-related complications and emergencies, the idea being that the procedure is \"practiced in the dark,\" Aden said. \"Only when such a system is in place will we finally be able to unmask the reality of abortion in America.\"\n\nThe Women's Health Defense Act seeks to ban abortions at or after 20 weeks of gestation, except in some cases of medical emergency. \"Abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more dangerous to a woman than carrying to term,\" he said.\n\nThe Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act forbids selective abortions \"seeking to target babies,\" Aden said, based on prenatal diagnostic testing that shows the gender of the baby or a diagnosis such as Down syndrome.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLastly, Aden pointed to the Unborn Infants Dignity Act, which he said \"treats human lives in the womb as just that, human,\" and requires \"cremation or proper burial\" of \"miscarried, stillborn or aborted infants\" and protection from \"scientific experimentation.\"\n\nAll of these efforts are precisely what proponents of abortion access are preparing to address.

Meanwhile, a third of kids who have used e-cigs have used marijuana in them.\n\n\"The bottom line,\" according to Alex Azar, the US secretary of health and human services, is that \"in the datasets we use, we have never seen use of any substance rise this rapidly.\"\n\nThe percentage of high school-age children reporting past 30-day use of e-cigarettes rose by more than 75% between 2017 and 2018, while use among middle school-age kids increased nearly 50%, the National Youth Tobacco Survey showed. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health's Monitoring the Future survey , released Monday, recorded a single year surge with more than 37% of 12th graders reporting use in the past year compared to nearly 28% in 2017.\n\nThe skyrocketing rise in e-cigarettes comes at a time when there are \"encouraging signs elsewhere\" -- namely, the fact that alcohol use, tobacco use and opioid use among youth have declined, Azar said.\n\nHowever, the epidemic of vaping could contribute to \"a whole generation addicted to nicotine,\" he said noting that no amount of nicotine is safe.\n\n\"I'm talking about my own kids,\" Adams said. \"My 14, 13 and 9-year-olds are all familiar to these products since elementary school.\"\n\nMisconceptions and myths surrounding e-cigarettes contribute to the epidemic, he added. Meanwhile, parents do not even know what signs to look for or what questions to ask their kids.\n\nWhich is why Adams took the step of issuing an advisory. It's the second time he's taken such action. In April , he issued an advisory to get more Americans to carry the opioid overdose antidote naloxone.\n\nE-cigarettes are not harmless\n\nLike regular cigarettes, most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, an addictive drug that harms the developing brains of teens. Because the brain continues to develop until about age 25, nicotine's negative health effects include damage to learning, memory and attention abilities. Add to that, teens who use nicotine are at increased risk for addiction to other drugs.\n\n\"The number one reason teens say they use these products is because they say they have flavors in them,\" said Adams, who noted that many e-cigarettes come in kid-friendly flavors.\n\nSarah Ryan, a high school senior from Holbrook, Massachusetts, who also spoke at the news conference, said there are over 8,000 flavors. Some \"taste like Sour Patch Kids,\" she said. The flavors hide the nicotine, which most kids don't even know is there, she added.\n\nSome of the chemicals used to make certain flavors may also pose health risks, according to Adams. In addition to nicotine, the vapor from e-cigs may include other harmful substances, including heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.\n\nWhile e-cigarettes may contain less harmful chemicals than other tobacco products, Adams cautioned, \"Less harm does not mean harmless.\"\n\nSpreading like 'wildfire' in high school\n\nKids, though, believe it's just \"water and flavor,\" said school substance abuse counselor Mila Vascones-Gatski who also spoke at the news conference. The smell is more difficult to detect and the cloud of vapor dissipates so quickly it's hard for anyone to see, though increasingly teachers report kids are vaping in a classroom. \"How do we know? They take selfies of themselves vaping in the classroom,\" she said.\n\nThe surge in e-cigarette use among teens has been fueled by cartridge-based devices, which look like a USB flash drive. The newest devices are not only easy to conceal but most parents would not recognize them as anything other than a tech item. The most ubiquitous version is called Juul, which now has more than a 70% share of the cartridge-based e-cigarette market in the United States, according to the surgeon general.\n\nA typical Juul cartridge, or \"pod,\" contains about as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.\n\nRyan said a sixth-grader told her, \"it was easier to get someone to loan him a Juul than a pencil.\"\n\nShe also said that this year, e-cigarette use \"really spread like wildfire.\" Her high school had to shut down one of the bathrooms due to vaping, she said, while some kids have been caught vaping during class. Meanwhile, she said a convenience store directly across the street from her school has sold e-cigarette products.\n\nTargeting those who sell to kids\n\nConvenience stores are one of the targets of the US Food and Drug Administration, according to Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who also spoke at the news conference. With him at the helm, the agency has taken aggressive steps and will continue to do so over the next couple of months. He hopes to limit both the access and appeal these products have to kids, which he will try to accomplish by stepping up enforcement activities at stores where kids get access to e-cigarettes.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's my belief that we've been successful in this country at stigmatizing tobacco products among kids,\" Gottlieb said. \"We haven't been effective stigmatizing e-cigarette use.\"\n\nAdams applauded the FDA in September for launching a campaign to prevent kids from using e-cigarettes.\n\nTuesday he recognized the potential of e-cigarettes as a tool of harm reduction among adults who are addicted to traditional cigarettes, but added that today's conference prioritized alerting parents, teachers and health officials about the dangers of youth e-cigarette use.\n\n\"We will not stand for another year of exponential rise in the use of these products,\" Adams said. \"We're far too often -- in health and public health -- late to the game. Now is the time to take action.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids offer little chronic pain benefit and wane over time, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/rFtS5PlVtYc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) For adults with chronic pain, opioids offer narrow improvements over a placebo for pain and physical functioning, on average, according to a new analysis published Tuesday. And the majority of patients will experience no meaningful benefit.\n\nThose benefits also tend to decrease over time and come with the risk of side effects such as vomiting and constipation, according to the review of nearly 100 randomized trials published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Down the line, risks may include physical dependence and overdose.\n\n\"The benefits of opioids for managing chronic pain tend to be quite modest,\" said study author Jason Busse, associate professor in the department of anesthesia at McMaster University's school of medicine in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSubgroups of the studies included in the analysis suggest that non-opioid alternatives -- such as NSAIDs, certain antidepressants and medical cannabis -- may offer similar benefits to opioids on average. But the evidence for that is less strong, Busse said.\n\nThe analysis comes as federal agencies and other officials in recent years have been cracking down on the prescription of opioids, dually recognized as an important tool in the treatment of pain and as a gateway to physical dependence and addiction.\n\nIn 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines urging doctors to prescribe these drugs more responsibly for people with chronic pain. But Busse said the CDC report set the bar for placebo-controlled studies too high in its analysis; it looked for studies that followed up with patients for at least a year, of which there were none.\n\n\"We have looked at a lot of additional evidence that was not considered by the CDC guidelines,\" he said.\n\nDr. Jianguo Cheng, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said the new analysis reinforces what's become conventional wisdom among pain specialists. He was not involved in the study.\n\n\"We're going to try the least risky drug first, so therefore opioids [are] not a first line of treatment in most cases,\" said Cheng, also the director of director of the Cleveland Clinic Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship Program. \"It's not a second line of treatment, and maybe not a third line of treatment.\"\n\nThe CDC describes chronic pain as \"lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing.\" It is among the top reasons for seeking medical care in the US, affecting just over 20% of adults -- about 50 million people -- in 2016, according to one report this year. Other estimates suggest that the number is twice that.\n\n\"It's a very complicated and diverse population of patients,\" Cheng said, including those who may have suffered injuries, had multiple surgeries or live with disability.\n\nThis is differentiated from other kinds of pain, such as acute pain and cancer pain. For the latter, Cheng said, the use of opioids is far less controversial.\n\nJust because most of these patients won't see meaningful improvements, however, is not to ignore the subset that will experience them, Busse said.\n\n\"A problematic interpretation of [the study findings] would be: Opioids don't provide any meaningful pain relief,\" he said. \"The challenge with that interpretation is it assumes that every patient will get the same amount of pain relief.\"\n\nHis study estimates how many chronic pain patients a doctor would need to treat in order for one to experience meaningful improvements: For pain, it's roughly eight patients. For physical functioning, it's 12 patients. For sleep quality, 17 patients.\n\nAnd this is the \"best case scenario,\" according to an editorial published in the same journal by doctors with the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care.\n\nThe studies included in the analysis largely weeded out patients with past or present substance use disorder, which Busse described as \"selecting patients that would be prognostically better off.\" Nearly half of the studies excluded patients who were diagnosed with or treated for mental illness, as well.\n\nMore than three-quarters of studies in the analysis were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the study points out. Other research has shown that industry-funded studies tend to produce better outcomes across a variety of fields.\n\nIn recent years, pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for aggressively marketing opioids to doctors. Leading up to the early 2000s, opioids were seen as a wonder drug , and doctors were urged to treat pain more aggressively. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in an open letter that doctors were taught that these medications were not addictive if patients were in \"legitimate pain.\" Multiple studies have shown this to be false.\n\n2013 study estimated that one in five patients who see a doctor for acute or chronic noncancer pain get prescribed opioids.\n\nAnother study last year supported a push by the CDC and other health experts to taper chronic pain patients off opioids when possible, saying they may have a better quality of life without them. But Cheng says this should be done carefully and may not work immediately for all patients, adding, \"I have seen many patients abandoned by their physicians, and they cannot find the people to manage their pain.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAccording to Cheng, alternative treatments that may be effective -- such as physical and cognitive behavioral therapies -- can also be out of reach for many patients, in some cases because insurance doesn't reimburse these services.\n\nHowever, despite gaps in knowledge of treating chronic pain, experts say opioids are part of that arsenal -- even if they come with risks and benefits that need to be better understood.\n\n\"For individuals who are suffering with unrelenting chronic pain every day of their lives, if they've tried other alternatives that haven't worked, they may in some cases decide they still want to embark on a trial of [opioid] therapy,\" Busse said, \"and now they have the evidence to understand what their chances are of achieving meaningful improvement.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "#JUUL: How social media hyped nicotine for a new generation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sg8EfdZOZ54/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs has tried to distance itself from a vast social media presence that experts say drives its popularity among teens. But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nChristina Zayas was paid to post about Juul on her Instagram. The post has now been deleted.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teen vaping continues to rise while other drug use declines, survey finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/SzhAf6dLfsw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Vaping among America's teenagers continues to climb, while the use of other substances -- such as alcohol and opioids -- has declined in recent years, according to a new report.\n\nMonday's report, called Monitoring the Future , comes from the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and is based on an annual survey of drug and alcohol use and attitudes among eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders in the United States. This year's survey included 44,482 students from 392 public and private schools across the country.\n\nBehind drinking alcohol, vaping was the second-most common form of substance use, the study showed, with 17.6% of eighth-graders, 32.3% of 10th-graders and 37.3% of 12th-graders reporting vaping in the past year. Last year, the annual survey found that prevalence of vaping was 13.3% among eighth-graders, 23.9% among 10th-graders and 27.8% among 12th-graders.\n\nVaping involves using an electronic cigarette , hookah or similar device to inhale certain vapors or aerosols, which could contain substances such as nicotine, marijuana or flavoring.\n\n\"What we are seeing is a change in the patterns of drug taking among teenagers in that they are the lowest that we've seen for many years,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have very good news,\" she said, \"but at the same time, we have to be vigilant, because of this very high uptake and embracing of vaping by teenagers that could lead them then to the administration of other drugs.\"\n\nVaping: 'A real problem'\n\nThis year is the second in which the Monitoring the Future survey asked high schoolers about vaping specific substances: nicotine, marijuana or \"just flavoring.\"\n\nFlavoring was the most commonly reported substance among eighth-graders at 15.1%, followed by nicotine at 10.9% and then marijuana at 4.4%.\n\nTenth-graders reported identical rates for flavoring and nicotine, but 12.4% reported vaping marijuana. Among 12th-graders, 29.7% reported vaping nicotine, 25.7% flavoring and 13.1% marijuana.\n\n\"You're seeing right now that 30% of 12th-graders last year were exposed to nicotine,\" Volkow said.\n\n\"Another issue of concern is, these devices are very efficient at delivering drugs rapidly into your brain and, in so doing, deliver the drugs in ways that make them more addictive -- and so it's not just nicotine. Now we also know that they are using it for 9THC,\" or tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid chemical in marijuana, she said.\n\n\"However, since MTF doesn't appear to separate out vaping vs. Juuling in their survey, it is hard to know what the youth are using,\" Halpern-Felsher said of the new report.\n\n\"The overall decline or stabilization of other drug use is promising, although the increase in vaping marijuana is concerning,\" she said. \"Clearly, youth drug prevention messages needs to go beyond conventional drugs and include all forms of nicotine and vaping.\"\n\nThe overall increase in vaping in the survey appears to be consistent with data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a 78% increase in youth vaping between 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Pamela Ling, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco , who works with the school's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education and was not involved with the new report.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration \"has also recognized an 'epidemic' of youth vaping. The consistency of these data suggests this is a real problem,\" Ling said.\n\n\"While we see declines in cigarette smoking among youth, the increases in vaping may lead to overall rates of tobacco or nicotine use increasing. We also know from many longitudinal studies of youth that those who use e-cigarettes are about three times more likely to start smoking cigarettes ,\" she said. \"The increase in vaping goes against the trends for all other drugs and alcohol, which are declining. That's a problem.\"\n\nIn historical context, \"the absolute increases in the prevalence of nicotine vaping among 12th-graders and 10th-graders are the largest ever recorded by Monitoring the Future in the 44 years that it has continuously tracked dozens of substances,\" the authors of the report wrote in a letter to the editor Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional use of cigarettes remained at the lowest levels in the survey's history.\n\nDaily cigarette use was reported by 0.8% of eighth-graders, 1.8% of 10th-graders and 3.6% of 12th-graders in 2018, the survey showed. Lifetime cigarette use among 12th-graders went down from 26.6% in 2017 to 23.8% in 2018, and past-month use declined from 9.7% to 7.6%.\n\nIn general, substances at historic low levels of use in 2018 were alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, prescription opioids, MDMA (ecstasy or Molly), methamphetamine, amphetamines, sedatives and ketamine, according to the report.\n\nAlcohol and opioid use dropping among teens\n\nEven though alcohol and binge drinking rates appeared to be on the decline, alcohol was still \"the most frequently used substance\" in the report, Volkow said.\n\nPast-month use of alcohol was reported by 8.2%, 18.6% and 30.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the survey. Yet the percentage of teenagers who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" Volkow said.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Why are opioids so addictive? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why are opioids so addictive? 00:55\n\nThe new report also showed a significant drop over the past five years in the percentage of teenagers, particularly 12th-graders, using opioids despite the ongoing epidemic among adults in the United States\n\n\"It's fascinating that despite the fact that we have very high rates of opioids and heroin among adults, adolescents have the lowest rates that we have seen since the inception of the survey,\" Volkow said.\n\nFor instance, Vicodin use dropped by 58.4% in eighth-graders, 75.4% in 10th-graders and 67.2% in 12th-graders over the past five years, according to the report.\n\nThe survey also showed a shift in how easy teens think opioid drugs are to access.\n\nOne in three 12th-graders, or 32.5%, said in this year's report that prescription opioids were easily available, compared with more than 54.2% in 2010.\n\n\"Intriguingly, when they go off to college or go to work, you see the highest rates of opioid use among 18 to 24 years of age. So there is a big gap between the patterns of consumptions of opioids in teenagers and then when they go into young adulthood,\" Volkow said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe added that the difficulty youths face in accessing opioid drugs could explain this stark difference in use between teenagers and young adults.\n\n\"I think many of the campaigns that are trying to make it harder to get access to prescription opioids have had an effect,\" Volkow said.\n\n\"This has been decreasing the number of prescription opioids given in our country, of the number of tablets given, and as a result of that, there are less tablets in parents' cabinets, and they are actually harder to get even in the black market,\" she said.\n\n\"Also, perhaps educational campaigns about the high risk of overdoses that are associated with the use of these substances, and the high risk of addiction to these substances, all of these factors may have had a positive impact (on) teenagers.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Insurer 'made money from my loyalty'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46596162", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Nick Munday says customer loyalty was an easy way for firms to make money\n\nLoyalty came at a cost for Nick Munday - a cost that can be calculated at \u00a31,250 a year.\n\nThe 61-year-old had been a home and contents insurance customer with the same provider for 20 years, and was eventually paying \u00a32,000 a year.\n\nOne phone call querying the cost reduced the annual premium to \u00a3750.\n\nNow the UK's competition watchdog has said millions of unsuspecting customers were being exploited by bad practices by firms.\n\nIt has responded to a so-called super complaint from Citizens Advice which argues that loyal customers are being \"ripped off\" for mobile, broadband, savings, home insurance and mortgage deals.\n\nFindings by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) included year-on-year \"stealth price rises\", costly exit fees, difficulties for customers to cancel contracts or switch providers, and consumers being required to automatically renew a contract.\n\nAndrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: \"Our work has uncovered a range of problems which leave people feeling ripped off, let down and frustrated. They shouldn't have to be constantly on guard, spending hours searching for or negotiating a good deal, to avoid being trapped into bad value contracts or falling victim to stealth price rises.\n\n\"Millions of loyal or vulnerable customers are being taken advantage of each year by firms - and end up paying much more than they should do. This must come to an end.\"\n\nIt backed up Citizens Advice claims that customers who stick with their supplier are losing a total of \u00a34.1bn a year, the equivalent to an average of \u00a3877 per person.\n\nThat cost was higher for Mr Munday. He said his insurance premium with Santander was \u00a32,000 a year, having used their services for two decades.\n\nWhen he shopped around, he was quoted a price of \u00a3469 from another provider. He contacted Santander, which said it could reduce his premium to \u00a3750.\n\n\"It is despicable. They are treating loyal customers really poorly,\" he said.\n\n\"Loyalty should be worth something. It would be good if big companies rewarded people accordingly.\"\n\nHe said that putting up premiums each year was \"an easy way for them to make more money\". For him, a saving of \u00a3100 a month was an important difference.\n\nSantander said that the cost reflected some claims made on the policy. It said that a renewal notice would have pointed out that he may have received a better deal with another product from Santander or elsewhere.\n\n\"Santander is constantly working to ensure that our prices are fair and competitive,\" it said.\n\n\"We will continue to do this and the Citizens Advice super complaint and recent-announced FCA market review will be a key consideration for us.\"\n\nWhy is he not the only example?\n\nCitizens Advice said it knew of a couple aged in their 90s who were paying \u00a31,000 a year too much for their home insurance, having been with the same company for six years.\n\nIt said that was an example of a wider issue. In its complaint, it said problems had been detected in five particular areas:\n\nsavings accounts\n\nmortgages\n\nhousehold insurance\n\nmobile phone contracts\n\nbroadband contracts\n\nThis super complaint requires a response from the CMA which has now been published.\n\nCitizens Advice described the CMA's report as a strong response, and said regulators must now follow this up in the deadline for progress of six months set by the CMA.\n\n\"The CMA is clear that nothing should be off the table when it comes to tackling the loyalty penalty, including targeted price caps, so we are expecting bold action,\" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive.\n\nIn the meantime, the insurance and telecoms industries have made changes aimed at reducing the impact of higher charges for loyal customers.\n\nWhat has the competition watchdog said it will do?\n\nThe CMA said that millions of people had been \"exploited\" as a result of practices in these markets.\n\nThis ranged from about one million people being affected in the mortgage market to 12 million in the insurance sector.\n\nIt said vulnerable people, including the elderly and those on low incomes, were most at risk of paying a loyalty penalty.\n\nAs a result, it has opened a consumer law enforcement investigation in the anti-virus software sector, and warned that it could follow suit in other sectors.\n\nIt has also outlined various recommendations to regulators and government, including targeted price caps to protect the vulnerable.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe watchdog suggested that Ofcom introduces regulation to stop mobile providers charging pay-monthly customers the same rate once they had effectively paid off their handsets at the end of the minimum contract period.\n\nSome providers are already following that rule.\n\nIt added that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), should \"look closely\" at evidence that insurance firms continually raised prices and take action to prevent people being exploited. This should include considering \"pricing interventions\".\n\nMr Coscelli, of the CMA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"aggressive discounts\" benefitted new customers, but after \"taking a step back\" the picture did not look so good for consumers.\n\n\"We like the deals to new customers, we like new companies coming in with new ideas, and they need to have a chance to succeed in new markets,\" he said.\n\n\"What we are saying to companies is they need to assess their practices and see whether they are legal, and to decide if they should continue as they do or change some of their approaches.\"\n\nHuw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: \"Three quarters of insurance customers benefit from shopping around, but we accept there needs to be a better balance between the deals offered to new consumers and the interests of long-standing customers.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Greg Clark said companies continuing to take advantage of loyal consumers should know that the government would intervene.\n\n\"We will publish a comprehensive Consumer White Paper in the first part of next year to ensure markets provide consumers with competitive prices and quality products and services,\" he said.\n\nHow do you ensure you're getting the best deal on your bills?

Elon Musk has unveiled a prototype underground tunnel in Los Angeles which is designed to transport cars at high speed around the city.\n\nThe tunnel is only a mile (1.6km) long at the moment but the goal is a network to ease chronic traffic congestion.\n\nModified electric cars would be lowered into the tunnel and travel at speeds up to 150mph (240km/h), Mr Musk says.\n\nThe tunnel has been built by Mr Musk's Boring Company, which boasts state-of-the-art engineering techniques.\n\nMr Musk, best known as the head of Tesla electric cars and the commercial SpaceX programme, arrived at the launch on Tuesday evening in a Tesla car modified to work on the \"loop\" system.\n\nHe was cheered by a small crowd as he emerged from the car at one end of the tunnel bathed in green and blue interior

They shouldn't have to be constantly on guard, spending hours searching for or negotiating a good deal, to avoid being trapped into bad value contracts or falling victim to stealth price rises.\n\n\"Millions of loyal or vulnerable customers are being taken advantage of each year by firms - and end up paying much more than they should do. This must come to an end.\"\n\nIt backed up Citizens Advice claims that customers who stick with their supplier are losing a total of \u00a34.1bn a year, the equivalent to an average of \u00a3877 per person.\n\nThat cost was higher for Mr Munday. He said his insurance premium with Santander was \u00a32,000 a year, having used their services for two decades.\n\nWhen he shopped around, he was quoted a price of \u00a3469 from another provider. He contacted Santander, which said it could reduce his premium to \u00a3750.\n\n\"It is despicable. They are treating loyal customers really poorly,\" he said.\n\n\"Loyalty should be worth something. It would be good if big companies rewarded people accordingly.\"\n\nHe said that putting up premiums each year was \"an easy way for them to make more money\". For him, a saving of \u00a3100 a month was an important difference.\n\nSantander said that the cost reflected some claims made on the policy. It said that a renewal notice would have pointed out that he may have received a better deal with another product from Santander or elsewhere.\n\n\"Santander is constantly working to ensure that our prices are fair and competitive,\" it said.\n\n\"We will continue to do this and the Citizens Advice super complaint and recent-announced FCA market review will be a key consideration for us.\"\n\nWhy is he not the only example?\n\nCitizens Advice said it knew of a couple aged in their 90s who were paying \u00a31,000 a year too much for their home insurance, having been with the same company for six years.\n\nIt said that was an example of a wider issue. In its complaint, it said problems had been detected in five particular areas:\n\nsavings accounts\n\nmortgages\n\nhousehold insurance\n\nmobile phone contracts\n\nbroadband contracts\n\nThis super complaint requires a response from the CMA which has now been published.\n\nCitizens Advice described the CMA's report as a strong response, and said regulators must now follow this up in the deadline for progress of six months set by the CMA.\n\n\"The CMA is clear that nothing should be off the table when it comes to tackling the loyalty penalty, including targeted price caps, so we are expecting bold action,\" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive.\n\nIn the meantime, the insurance and telecoms industries have made changes aimed at reducing the impact of higher charges for loyal customers.\n\nWhat has the competition watchdog said it will do?\n\nThe CMA said that millions of people had been \"exploited\" as a result of practices in these markets.\n\nThis ranged from about one million people being affected in the mortgage market to 12 million in the insurance sector.\n\nIt said vulnerable people, including the elderly and those on low incomes, were most at risk of paying a loyalty penalty.\n\nAs a result, it has opened a consumer law enforcement investigation in the anti-virus software sector, and warned that it could follow suit in other sectors.\n\nIt has also outlined various recommendations to regulators and government, including targeted price caps to protect the vulnerable.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe watchdog suggested that Ofcom introduces regulation to stop mobile providers charging pay-monthly customers the same rate once they had effectively paid off their handsets at the end of the minimum contract period.\n\nSome providers are already following that rule.\n\nIt added that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), should \"look closely\" at evidence that insurance firms continually raised prices and take action to prevent people being exploited. This should include considering \"pricing interventions\".\n\nMr Coscelli, of the CMA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"aggressive discounts\" benefitted new customers, but after \"taking a step back\" the picture did not look so good for consumers.\n\n\"We like the deals to new customers, we like new companies coming in with new ideas, and they need to have a chance to succeed in new markets,\" he said.\n\n\"What we are saying to companies is they need to assess their practices and see whether they are legal, and to decide if they should continue as they do or change some of their approaches.\"\n\nHuw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: \"Three quarters of insurance customers benefit from shopping around, but we accept there needs to be a better balance between the deals offered to new consumers and the interests of long-standing customers.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Greg Clark said companies continuing to take advantage of loyal consumers should know that the government would intervene.\n\n\"We will publish a comprehensive Consumer White Paper in the first part of next year to ensure markets provide consumers with competitive prices and quality products and services,\" he said.\n\nHow do you ensure you're getting the best deal on your bills?

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Waste plan floats bottle deposit scheme", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46594380", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nConsumers will have to pay a returnable deposit on bottles, cans and disposable cups under a new government strategy.\n\nHomes in England will be provided by councils with separate collections for food waste.\n\nRecycling will be made less confusing for households, and manufacturers will need to foot the cost of disposing of the goods they produce.\n\nThe plan has been cautiously welcomed by green groups, but some business groups are wary.\n\nThe strategy is designed to help combat climate change, safeguard resources and reduce the flow of plastic to the ocean.\n\nCheck what you can recycle in your area\n\nPlastic recycling: How do bottle deposit schemes work?\n\nA passion for recycling: 'It's my day job'\n\nWhy are the changes needed?\n\nThe last waste strategy was set out 11 years ago and since then concern has boomed over climate change, the oceans and the way we use resources.\n\nRotting waste is a major source of greenhouse gases that are over-heating the planet.

You would be encouraged to use it but not be forced to do so.\n\nThe introduction of food waste containers may mean getting your main rubbish bin emptied less often.\n\nYou would have to pay a bit extra as a deposit on drinks containers, including coffee cups. You would get the deposit back if and when you recycled it.\n\nYou may have to be more careful which trader you employ to get rid of your old fridge or unwanted mattress - because they could be electronically tracked to ensure they do not dump it.\n\nThe goods that you buy may last longer and be more easily repaired, if government plans are effective.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nThere are considerable differences currently around the UK. For instance, only around 35% of households in England are obliged to put food waste in its own caddy. That compares with 56% in Scotland and 100% in Wales. The figures exclude food waste mixed with garden waste.\n\nQuick quiz\n\nAnalysis\n\nWe must stop throwing so much away, because there is no \"away\".\n\nThis is the key philosophy behind the government waste strategy. It is a huge and complicated area of policy, touching the lives of each of us, of businesses and of councils as well as government.\n\nThere is frustration among campaigners and opposition parties that many policy details are missing, and many going out to further consultation.\n\nBut some of the measures do look genuinely ambitious, and experts say that some of the policies will go further than those proposed by the EU.\n\nIf Michael Gove actually delivers, many will think the wait has been worthwhile, as this strategy could transform our attitudes to resources on the planet.\n\nHow are people reacting to the plans?\n\nLibby Peake from the Green Alliance responded: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good in the policy \u2013 it\u2019s on the right lines. But we need to see the detail of exactly how things will work.\u201d\n\nShe, and others, worry that major retailers will persuade the government during its consultation phase to exclude large drinks bottles from the deposit return scheme.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium says most of the problem with beach litter is \u201con-the-go\u201d containers, not one litre bottles from supermarkets.\n\nThey also fear the cost of installing the \u201creverse vending\u201d machines that pay people for returning their containers.\n\nShadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said: \"You can't aim to prevent fly tipping without ending cuts to the councils. And we need a plan for stopping the export of UK recycling and waste plastics to countries where they currently end up in landfill or polluting our oceans.\n\n\"Rather than a vision for building our recycling infrastructure, it talks about voluntary action and distant target deadlines, while talking up the value of more incinerators.\"\n\nCouncils fear that if aluminium cans are part of the deposit scheme they will no longer appear in household bins, where they are the most lucrative item for recycling.\n\nMartin Tett from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, welcomed plans for companies to pay the cost of recycling their products.\n\nHowever he warned: \"Moves to standardise waste services, including weekly food collections, need to be fully funded.\"\n\nSamantha Harding, from the green group CPRE, told BBC News she welcomed some proposals in the report. She said: \u201cSeparating food waste is essential \u2013 because decomposing food in general household bins reduces the value of other material sent for re-cycling.\u201d\n\nThere is some frustration among campaigners that key issues are still not tied down after many months of debate.\n\nBut sources suggest the Treasury is resisting measures that might increase costs, and industry is warning that rushed policies could backfire.\n\nToday\u2019s plans build on the Autumn Budget, which announced a world-leading tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content - subject to consultation.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Pterosaurs: Fur flies over feathery fossils", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46572782", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Yuan Zhang/Nature Ecology & Evolution Image caption What pterosaurs might have looked like\n\nTwo exceptionally well preserved fossils give a new picture of the pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived at the time of the dinosaurs.\n\nScientists believe the creatures may have had feathers, and looked something like brown bats with fuzzy wings.\n\nThe surprise discovery suggests feathers evolved not in birds, nor dinosaurs, but in more distant times.\n\nPterosaurs were the closest relatives of dinosaurs, sharing a common ancestor about 250 million years ago.\n\n\"We would suggest - tentatively - that it would be worth considering that feathers originated much earlier than we thought,\" Prof Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol, told BBC News.\n\nHailing from China, the 160-million-year-old fossils are of two different pterosaurs, one of which is newly discovered.\n\nStrange feathery creatures\n\nIn depth analysis shows that as well as fur - which has been suggested before - the flying reptiles had feathers like some dinosaurs, including the theropods.\n\n\"If I just saw these fluffy bits on their own, I would swear they were from a theropod dinosaur,\" said Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study.\n\n\"This means feathers were not a bird innovation, not even a dinosaur innovation, but evolved first in a much more distant ancestor.\n\n\"The age of dinosaurs was full of all sorts of strange feathery creatures!\"\n\nImage copyright Baoyu Jiang, Michael Benton et al./Nature Ecology Image caption Are these feathers?\n\nThe researchers found that the pterosaurs had four different kinds of covering, including fuzzy, fur over most of their body; and, on parts of the head and wings, three types of fibres similar to modern feathers.\n\nThe fluff and feathers are likely to have been important in heat regulation and aerodynamics.\n\n\"These structures on the pterosaur make it look a bit like a fruit bat, or something like that, a fuzzy hairy creature,\" said Prof Benton, who worked on the discovery with colleagues in China.\n\n\"They fly with great out-stretched bony wings that carry a substantial membrane, a bit like a bat.\"\n\nFlight in the Jurassic skies\n\nQuestions still remain over whether these are true feathers.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US State Department Clears $3.5B Sale of Patriot Missiles to Turkey", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-department-clears-3-5b-sale-of-patriot-missiles-to-turkey/4706932.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $3.5 billion sale of Patriot air and missile defense systems to Turkey, the Pentagon said on Tuesday after notifying Congress of the certification.\n\nThe Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the State Department had approved the sale of 80 Patriot guidance-enhanced missiles and 60 other missiles to Ankara along with related equipment, including radar sets, engagement control stations and launching stations.\n\nThe State Department said earlier this year it was working with NATO ally Turkey on the possible sale of a Raytheon Co.-Patriot missile defense system to keep it from buying a Russian-made S-400 system.\n\nBut twice in Turkey's selection process, Ankara passed over the Patriot system, first choosing a Chinese system before turning to the Russian S-400 system in 2017.\n\nU.S. and NATO officials have repeatedly warned Ankara that the Russian system cannot be integrated into the NATO air and missile defense system and that purchasing the S-400 system would jeopardize Turkey's purchase of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets and possibly result in Washington imposing sanctions.\n\nThe notification process alerts Congress that a sale to a foreign country has been approved, but it does not indicate that a contract has been signed or negotiations have concluded."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Nevada Becomes 1st US State with Female-Majority Legislature", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nevada-becomes-1st-us-state-with-female-majority-legislature/4706887.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "Nevada became the first state in the U.S. with an overall female majority in the Legislature on Tuesday when county officials in Las Vegas appointed two women to fill vacancies in the state assembly.\n\nThe appointments of Democrats Rochelle Thuy Nguyen and Beatrice \"Bea'' Angela Duran to two Las Vegas-area legislative seats give women 51 percent of the 63 seats in the legislature.\n\nWomen will hold nine of 21 seats in the state Senate, falling short of a majority in that chamber.

Salt Lake City got caught in a bribery scandal that nearly derailed the plans for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nTwo decades later, the script has flipped.\n\nThe IOC is struggling to find cities willing to take on the financial and societal burden of hosting the Winter Olympics. The race to host the 2026 Winter Olympics is down to just two cities after several dropped out over a lack of local support. Beijing got the 2022 Winter Olympics by attrition, winning by four votes over Almaty, Kazakhstan, after a half-dozen European bidders dropped out, discouraged by soaring costs and taxpayer backlash.\n\nThat's why a city that, for a time, stood out as a pariah in the Olympic world is a serious contender again, this time for the 2030 Winter Games \u2014 decades sooner than anyone expected and despite that bid scandal.\n\nVenues are already built\n\nUtah's capital city is among an increasingly small group of cities worldwide that has the venues needed for winter sports and the willingness to take on the costly task of hosting Olympics that have lost some of their cache. The U.S. Olympic Committee last week chose Salt Lake City over Denver as a future bid city. The IOC will choose a 2030 host by 2023 at the latest.\n\nJules Boykoff, a Pacific University professor who has written widely on the Olympics, said the bribery scandal is \u201ca pretty big stain on the history of the games.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut these days, the International Olympic Committee is not in a position to be overly picky,\u201d Boykoff said.\n\nThe scandal broke in 1998, three years after Salt Lake City was chosen over cities in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Salt Lake's bid committee doled out $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical care, gifts and other favors to IOC members and their families. That included ski trips, NBA tickets, plastic surgery, knee replacements, violins and housing and salary for children of IOC members, according to report by an ethics panel.\n\nIt led to the expulsion of six IOC members, the resignation of four others severe warnings for several others though none faced criminal charges. U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges against two Salt Lake bid leaders, but both men were acquitted by a judge halfway through a federal trial.\n\nThe IOC brought in outside experts to help reshape the organization. The IOC approved a 50-point reform package that included a ban on member visits to bid cities, creation of an independent ethics committee and term limits.\n\nBribery scandal hasn't been forgotten\n\nOlympic historian David Wallechinsky said Salt Lake City's current bid officials will have to talk about the scandal, but he doesn't think it will impact their candidacy. The Salt Lake City bribery scandal capped off decades of cities trying to win the favor of IOC board members behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cThey learned from the corruption of other cities that beat them before,\u201d Wallechinsky said. \u201cIt's not like they invented the corruption . . . they just got caught.\u201d\n\nMitt Romney, who was brought in to steer the 2002 Games through the scandal, said the city selection process is a now a more transparent process than it was in the past.\n\n\u201cThat's good for Salt Lake City,\u201d said Romney, elected last month to represent Utah in the U.S. Senate. \u201cWe will be judged on the merits.\u201d\n\nBoykoff said it is naive for anyone to think corruption is a thing of the past at the IOC, citing the case of honorary member Carlos Nuzman of Brazil who headed the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. He was suspended on corruption allegations connected with vote-buying.\n\nBefore the IOC picks a city for 2030, it will have to choose a host for 2026 between Stockholm and the duel bid of Milan and Cortina d' Ampezzo, Italy. Calgary, Canada, host of the 1998 Winter Olympics, backed out after voters rejected a referendum. Three other cities withdrew earlier this year and Erzurum, Turkey, was eliminated last month by the IOC.\n\nBid of $1.35 billion\n\nSalt Lake City says it can host the Olympics for about $1.35 billion, not including additional security costs covered by the U.S. government, relying mainly on existing venues. Stockholm and Milan/Cortina d' Ampezzo offer similar plans and similarly low estimates, $1.5 billion.\n\nWallechinsky and Boykoff doubt any city can host the Olympics for that little. A 2016 study at Oxford University found the Olympics have the highest average cost overrun of any type of megaproject.\n\nSalt Lake City's 2002 Olympics cost $2.52 billion, a 24 percent cost overrun, the Oxford report found. That was actually the second lowest cost overrun behind only the 2010 Vancouver Olympics among all Olympics held from 1960-2016.\n\nThe lack of public opposition that helped make Utah appealing to the USOC could change as the real costs emerge, Boykoff said.\n\n\u201cRight now, everything is kind of like unicorns and rainbows and low budgets,'' Boykoff. \u201cAlmost inevitably the price tag tends to go up.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Nevada Becomes 1st US State with Female-Majority Legislature", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nevada-becomes-1st-us-state-with-female-majority-legislature/4706887.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "Nevada became the first state in the U.S. with an overall female majority in the Legislature on Tuesday when county officials in Las Vegas appointed two women to fill vacancies in the state assembly.\n\nThe appointments of Democrats Rochelle Thuy Nguyen and Beatrice \"Bea'' Angela Duran to two Las Vegas-area legislative seats give women 51 percent of the 63 seats in the legislature.\n\nWomen will hold nine of 21 seats in the state Senate, falling short of a majority in that chamber.

That first voyage by humans to another world set the stage for the still grander Apollo 11 moon landing seven months later.\n\nThere was unprecedented and unfathomable risk to putting three men atop a monstrous new rocket for the first time and sending them all the way to the moon. The mission was whipped together in just four months in order to reach the moon by year's end, before the Soviet Union.\n\nThere was the Old Testament reading by commander Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders.\n\nLastly, there was the photo named \"Earthrise,\" showing our blue and white ball \u2014 humanity's home \u2014 rising above the bleak, gray lunar landscape and 240,000 miles (386 million kilometers) in the distance.\n\nHumans had never set eyes on the far side of the moon, or on our planet as a cosmic oasis, surrounded completely by the black void of space. A half-century later, only 24 U.S. astronauts who flew to the moon have witnessed these wondrous sights in person.\n\nThe Apollo 8 crew is still around: Borman and Lovell are 90, Anders is 85.\n\nTo Lovell, the journey had the thrill and romance of true exploration, and provided an uplifting cap for Americans to a painful, contentious year marked by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, nationwide riots and protests of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe mission's impact was perhaps best summed up in a four-word telegram received by Borman. \"Thanks, you saved 1968.\"\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine \u2014 who at age 43 missed Apollo \u2014 marvels over the gutsy decision in August that year to launch astronauts to the moon in four months' time. He's pushing for a return to the moon, but with real sustainability this next go-around.\n\n50-50 chances\n\nThe space agency flipped missions and decided that instead of orbiting Earth, Borman and his crew would fly to the moon to beat the Soviets and pave the way for the lunar landings to come. And that was despite on its previous test flight, the Saturn V rocket lost parts and engines failed.\n\n\"Even more worrisome than all of this,\" Bridenstine noted earlier this month, Apollo 8 would be in orbit around the moon on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. \"In other words, if there was a failure here, it would wreck Christmas not only for everybody in the United States, but for everybody in the world.\"\n\nAs that first moon shot neared, Borman's wife, Susan, demanded to know the crew's chances. A NASA director answered: 50-50.\n\nBorman wanted to get to the moon and get back fast. In his mind, a single lap around the moon would suffice. His bosses insisted on more.\n\n\"My main concern in this whole flight was to get there ahead of the Russians and get home. That was a significant achievement in my eyes,\" Borman explained at the Chicago launch of the book Rocket Men last spring.\n\nEveryone eventually agreed: Ten orbits it would be.\n\nLiftoff of the Saturn V occurred on the morning of Saturday, Dec. 21, 1968.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the spaceship successfully slipped into orbit around the moon. Before bedtime, the first envoys to another world took turns reading the first 10 verses from Genesis. It had been left to Borman, before the flight, to find \"something appropriate\" to say for what was expected to be the biggest broadcast audience to date.\n\n\"We all tried for quite a while to figure out something, and it all came up trite or foolish,\" Borman recalled. Finally, the wife of a friend of a friend came up with the idea of Genesis.\n\n\"In the beginning,\" Anders read, \"God created the heaven and the Earth ...\"\n\nBorman ended the broadcast with, \"And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you \u2014 all of you on the good Earth.\"\n\nOn Christmas morning, their spacecraft went around the moon for the final time. The engine firing needed to shoot them back to Earth occurred while the capsule was out of communication with Mission Control in Houston. Lovell broke the nervous silence as the ship reappeared: \"Please be informed there is a Santa Claus.\"\n\nBack in Houston, meanwhile, a limousine driver knocked on Marilyn Lovell's door and handed her a gift-wrapped mink stole with a card that read: \"To Marilyn, Merry Christmas from the man in the moon.\" Lovell bought the coat for his wife and arranged its fancy delivery before liftoff.\n\nSplashdown occurred in the pre-dawn darkness on Dec. 27, bringing the incredible six-day journey to a close. Time magazine named the three astronauts \"Men of the Year.\"\n\nEarthrise\n\nIt wasn't until after the astronauts were back that the significance of their Earth pictures sank in.\n\nAnders snapped the iconic Earthrise photo during the crew's fourth orbit of the moon, frantically switching from black-and-white to color film to capture the planet's exquisite, fragile beauty.\n\n\"Oh my God, look at that picture over there!\" Anders said. \"There's the Earth coming up. Wow, is that pretty!\"\n\nBefore the flight, no one had thought about photographing Earth, according to Anders. The astronauts were under orders to get pictures for potential lunar landing sites while orbiting 70 miles (112 kilometers) above the moon.\n\n\"We came to explore the moon and what we discovered was the Earth,\" Anders is fond of saying.\n\nHis Earthrise photo is a pillar of today's environmental movement. It remains a legacy of Apollo and humanity's achievement, said professor emeritus John Logsdon of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, forever underscoring the absence of political borders as seen from space.\n\nAnders wondered then \u2014 and now \u2014 \"This is not a very big place, why can't we get along?\"\n\nLovell remains awestruck by the fact he could hide all of Earth behind his thumb.\n\n\"Over 3 billion people, mountains, oceans, deserts, everything I ever knew was behind my thumb,\" he recalled at a recent anniversary celebration at Washington's National Cathedral.\n\nAstronaut-artist Nicole Stott said the golden anniversary provides an opportunity to reintroduce the world to Earthrise. She and three other former space travelers are holding a celebration Friday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, 50 years to the day Apollo 8 launched.\n\n\"That one image, I think, it just gives us the who and where we are in the universe so beautifully,\" she said.\n\nBy July 1969, Apollo 8 was overshadowed by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin moon landing. But without Apollo 8, noted George Washington's Logsdon, NASA likely would not have met President John F. Kennedy's deadline of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade.\n\nBorman and Anders never flew in space again, and Soviet cosmonauts never made it to the moon.\n\nLovell went on to command the ill-fated Apollo 13 \u2014 \"but that's another story.\" That flight was the most demanding, he said, \"But Apollo 8 was the one of exploration, the one of repeating the Lewis and Clark expedition ... finding the new Earth.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "World-Famous T.Rex Sue Gets New Lair in Chicago", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/world-famous-t-rex-sue-gets-new-lair-in-chicago/4706257.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Sue, the largest, most complete and best-preserved Tyrannosaurus rex ever unearthed, gets to show off its new lair this week at the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nThe museum on Friday will unveil the 40-1/2-foot-long (12.3-meter) Sue, one of the world's best-known dinosaur fossils, in the giant meat-eater's new permanent exhibition space after 10 months of work moving and remounting the huge bones. Sue's bones were mounted in a way that reflects new understanding about the species acquired over the past two decades.\n\nOne major change was the addition of gastralia, bones resembling an additional set of ribs spanning the belly that may have provided structural support to help the dinosaur breathe.\n\n\"The gastralia form a basket of bones in the abdominal wall and really help us visualize the size and girth of Sue.

The nation\u2019s suicide rate is where West Virginia\u2019s was nearly 20 years ago.\n\nObesity was common in West Virginia before it became widespread in the rest of the country. And life expectancy started tumbling in the Mountain State before it began falling across the U.S.\n\nMaggie Hill has lived in the state for all of her 67 years. Sitting in her cabin in the town of Madison recently, she ticked off the many deaths that have befallen her family: An older brother drowned in a flood in 1977. A sister died in a house fire. Two siblings, both smokers, died of lung cancer. Two others were stillborn. Her first husband died of congestive heart failure.\n\nThen there were the suicides. Two of her three sons shot themselves to death, one of them after losing his job. Her second husband died the same way, using a gun in their bedroom closet one Sunday morning while she was still in bed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people have a lot to live for,\u201d she said. \u201cI really and truly don\u2019t see things getting better.\u201d\n\nLife expectancy\n\nAfter decades of steady increases, U.S. life expectancy has been declining since 2014. A government report released last month said the trend continued last year, driven in part by suicides and drug overdoses \u2014 the so-called diseases of despair.\n\nWhat else is driving the decline? Experts say America\u2019s obesity problem has worsened the diabetes death rate and helped stall progress against the nation\u2019s leading killer, heart disease.West Virginia eclipses most other states in the percentage of people affected by diabetes, heart disease and obesity. It has had the nation\u2019s highest rate of drug overdose deaths for years running. It also has the highest obesity rate and the highest rates of diabetes and high blood pressure. Adding to those woes is the highest suicide rate among states east of the Mississippi River.\n\nEarlier this fall, U.S. health officials released for the first time life expectancy predictions at a neighborhood level. An Associated Press analysis of the data found wide disparities in cities and towns. Among states, the AP found, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy. West Virginia was the second lowest, behind Mississippi.\n\nMississippi, Oklahoma and a few other states suffer death and disease rates that are about as bad \u2014 or sometimes worse. But those places have unusually large populations of low-income black or Native American people, who suffer a disproportionate share of disability, disease and death.\n\nWest Virginia is 94 percent white. That makes it a telling indicator. Nearly 80 percent of the Americans who die each year are white people, and death rates rose in white men and women last year but were flat or falling in blacks and Hispanics.\n\nSo white deaths \u2014 particularly those of people who are not elderly \u2014 are mainly responsible for the nation\u2019s declining life expectancy.\n\nWidespread attention\n\nTen years ago, The Associated Press described Huntington, West Virginia, and its environs as the unhealthiest place in America , based on health survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that put it at the bottom of the charts in more than a half-dozen measures, including the highest proportions of people who were obese, had diabetes and had heart disease.\n\nThe AP report, and others like it, drew widespread attention that peaked in 2010, when celebrity chef Jamie Oliver staged a reality TV show in Huntington to teach people how to eat better.\n\nThe attention was not entirely welcomed. It felt like outsiders coming in to criticize and perpetuate \u201chillbilly\u201d stereotypes, said Steve Williams, who was elected Huntington\u2019s mayor in 2012.\n\nBut Williams said it also was motivating, prompting changes in school food and even improvements to parks and sidewalks.\n\n\u201cWe get slammed all the time with obesity,\u201d said Andy Fischer, a financial adviser who organized a 2,500-person community walking program. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better.\u201d\n\nThese days, the Huntington area looks somewhat better in government health surveys. For example, the region\u2019s obesity rate is only a few percentage points above the national median \u2014 instead of 10 or 20 points.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s clear the Huntington area still has some big problems. It ranks among the worst metro areas in measures like the percentage of adults who smoke, have high blood pressure and have had a stroke.\n\nOpioids and obesity\n\nAbout the time Huntington was trying to tackle its weight problem, it was rocked by a new crisis \u2014 opioid addiction.\n\nA recently-closed crisis and detox center in downtown Logan, W.Va. (AP Photo/Tyler Evert)\n\nWest Virginia now has the distinction of having the nation\u2019s highest drug overdose death rate. Last year, for the first time, the state\u2019s body count surpassed 1,000. The epidemic also produced ripple effects such as a spike in the number of children taken into foster care because of dead or addicted parents.\n\nIn the last two years, no West Virginia county has seen more overdose deaths than Cabell County, which includes Huntington.\n\nOne of the grimmest spots has been Huntington\u2019s West End \u2014 some locals call it \u201cthe Worst End.\u201d The AP analysis of neighborhood-level death data found the area had a life expectancy at birth of only 62 years, 16 years shorter than national life expectancy.\n\nHuntington\u2019s reputation crystalized on a chaotic Monday in August 2016, when emergency responders saw 28 overdoses over six hours \u2014 including two deaths.\n\nThe city soon became known as America\u2019s overdose capital. As documentary crews descended, Huntington tried to confront the problem. Among the efforts were quick-response teams charged with finding people days after they were treated for an overdose. The teams include a police officer, a clergy member, a paramedic and a treatment counselor who hand out overdose-reversing naloxone and provide information about treatment. They also direct people to a needle-exchange program run by the Cabell-Huntington Health Department.\n\nThommy Hill stands outside the Cabell County/Huntington Health Department, where he works in the harm reduction program, in Huntington, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018. (AP Photo/Tyler Evert)\n\nOne of the key figures in the program is Thommy Hill, a former drug dealer who has become its gatekeeper and central cog. He knows every drug user who visits and constantly tries to persuade them to try treatment \u2014 arranging immediate transportation and handing them a backpack full of clothes if they agree.\n\nOne morning in late October, bantering with a man who had come in for fresh needles, Hill lit up when the visitor mentioned a past vacation. Hill pitched him a one-week stay at a treatment hospital, joking that \u201cpeople will wait on you hand and foot.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, he explained: \u201cIt\u2019s all about treating them like people. They don\u2019t get a lot of that.\u201d\n\nSomething seems to be working. Non-fatal overdoses in Huntington have fallen and are on track to be 40 percent lower than 2017, city officials said. They are optimistic deaths will be down this year, too.\n\n\u201cIf we can turn around overdose numbers here, we can do it anywhere,\u201d Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in May at a health summit in Huntington.\n\nPoliticians including President Donald Trump have decried the opioid epidemic, prioritizing it over other health crises. But obesity still presents a towering threat.\n\nWest Virginians exercise less than other Americans. They eat fruits and vegetables less often. Only Mississippi has a larger proportion of adults drinking soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages each day.\n\nIn some cases, state policies are not helping.\n\nFor example, bariatric surgery can help certain obese people for whom conventional diet and exercise programs have no lasting effect. But West Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program has unusually harsh cost-control barriers that make it difficult for severely obese people to get approved for surgery, according to a recent analysis by George Washington University.\n\nThen there\u2019s the soda tax, which health advocates say can give consumers second thoughts about choosing those drinks. Last year, Gov. Jim Justice proposed raising it from 1 cent per 16.9-ounce bottle to a penny per ounce. It failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nSigns of change\n\nThere are some signs of hope in West Virginia. In October, health advocates held a conference on obesity in the South in West Virginia\u2019s capital city. It was a surprisingly upbeat meeting.\n\nThe South has long had the highest obesity rates in the country, and nowhere has adult obesity been more common than in West Virginia. But future-focused projects are popping up all over the state, aimed at getting kids to embrace exercise and healthy eating.\n\n\u201cWe want to give people hope that we can be knocked off the unhealthiest list\u201d of states, said Kayla Wright, director of an organization called Try This West Virginia that\u2019s funding many of them.\n\nOne grant paid for high school students to build a 5K trail and explore creating a teen cross-country running group. Another grant went toward restoring a greenhouse and helping people learn to garden.\n\nMany of the projects are baby steps, but conference participants cited a few places where progress seems broader. Huntington is one, they say.\n\nAnother is Mingo County, in the southwest corner of the state, deep in the heart of coal country. Life expectancy there has never been high. Jobs in the lumber and coal industries were notoriously dangerous. Doctors could be hard to find. And there was violence: The deadly Hatfield-McCoy feud played out in those hills, as did bloody labor battles between miners and coal companies.\n\nThe largest municipality in the county, Williamson, became known in the last decade as a center for the abuse of prescription opioid painkillers. (Some called the 3,000-person town \u201cPilliamson.\u201d)\n\nBut while the drug crisis was playing out, some local leaders \u2014 led by a young doctor named C. Donovan \u201cDino\u201d Beckett \u2014 built a series of programs aimed at creating a culture of health. It started seven years ago with the opening of a free clinic that later became the Williams Health and Wellness Center. That spawned a community garden and a vegetable delivery service, a running club and once-a-month 5K races that draw a few hundred runners. Also in the works, for next year, is a federally funded treatment program for people addicted to drugs.\n\nSo far, perhaps the most successful program is one that sends health workers to the homes of diabetics.\n\nJamie Muncy is one success story.\n\nThe 48-year-old lost his job three years ago when the mine he was working in shut down. Last fall, he had just pulled out of a long-term habit of pain pills and other drugs when he bizarrely tore a tendon in his foot while picking up a piece of paper at a post office.\n\nIt was so painful he rarely walked, but he continued to eat terribly. Out of a job and with his marriage in ruins, \u201cI had no motivation\u201d to be healthy, he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nBy January, the 5-foot-3 former mine foreman ballooned from 165 pounds to 196. \u201cI was round as I was tall,\u201d he said.\n\nA visit to the Williamson health center revealed he had alarming, diabetes-qualifying blood sugar levels. He\u2019d had mini-strokes in the past, and his physician said a much bigger one was probably on its way if Muncy did not take drastic steps.\n\nThe doctor put him on a tight carb-cutting diet, connected him to physical therapy and put him in the home-visit diabetes program.\n\nNow Muncy walks 5 miles a day and is a regular at the farmer\u2019s market. His weight is down to about 145 pounds, he said in a recent interview. He still smokes, though.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nUniversity of Washington researchers recently calculated something called \u201chealthy life expectancy\u201d \u2014 the period someone born today could expect to live in relative health. West Virginia, at 62\u00bd years, was the lowest among states.\n\nClearly, health problems abound.\n\nBlack lung disease rates and coal mine injury rates appear to be up.\n\nWest Virginia has been at the top of the charts in hepatitis B and C infection rates. Adding to that, the state saw an HIV outbreak last year, and it is still weathering a hepatitis A outbreak \u2014 both associated with injection drug users\n\nMaggie Hill, the lifelong West Virginian, has little hope for the future. But she does have Charity.\n\nCharity is a 10-year-old girl Hill adopted about five years ago. Hill\u2019s son had been raising her but lost custody during his ongoing struggle with drug addiction, Hill said.\n\nHill and Charity live in a small wooded valley with a creek in it \u2014 a holler, as they say in West Virginia. Her house is a cabin that from the outside resembles a small, tidy barn. Charity has given her life a purpose, she said.\n\n\u201cI taught her how to survive when I\u2019m gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to. She\u2019s going to need to know how to cook. ... She needs to know how to keep house. She needs to know how to mow grass, so if she ain\u2019t got a man, she can keep the yard clean. I teach her every bit of this.\u201d\n\nCharity is a good student (\u201cFour A\u2019s and a B on her last report card,\u201d Hill said). And there\u2019s hope that she will do well enough to go to college.

It would also allow inmates currently serving time for crack-cocaine offenses to petition courts for an earlier release.\n\nThe legislation passed by an 87-12 vote Tuesday evening despite vocal opposition from a group of conservatives who warned it would release violent felons into the streets to commit more crimes and imperil the re-election of every senator who votes for it.\n\nA broad, bipartisan coalition supported the bill, however, including \u201ctough on crime\u201d politicians like President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), as well as progressives like Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Even advocacy groups on opposite ends of the political spectrum like the American Civil Liberties Union on the left and FreedomWorks on the right offered their endorsement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever had legislation before the U.S. Senate where you\u2019ve put together such a diverse group of people,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) remarked on the floor ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cHow do you eat 1,000 marshmallows? One at a time. How do you pass a bill? One day at a time,\u201d he added, marveling at the unusual mix of supporters he helped marshal behind the legislation.\n\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever had legislation before the U.S. Senate where you\u2019ve put together such a diverse group of people. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)\n\nStill, proponents of the effort faced an uphill climb in convincing a recalcitrant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to allow it to come to the floor for a vote. The Kentucky Republican finally assented earlier this month after public and private pressure from the White House and a majority of his caucus.\n\nSupporters of the bill also had to defeat several controversial amendments authored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) that threatened to sink the bill. The provisions, which were successfully voted down on Tuesday, would have scaled back the legislation by excluding more offenders from participating in the bill\u2019s earned-time credit program and requiring the Bureau of Prisons to notify victims when a prisoner is released early.\n\nKennedy said the provisions were necessary to stem what he saw as \u201ca violation of American public safety\u201d that would lead to the mass release of felons. Grassley, however, called the measures \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and warned they would simply retraumatize victims by forcing them to be notified of a prisoner\u2019s release.\n\nThe underlying bill already excluded dozens of categories of offenders from earning time credits under the new system, a list that was broadened under a revised version of the legislation released last week. Still, detractors like Cotton said the bill would allow too many types of violent offenders could get out of prison before their sentences are up.\n\nThe legislation only addresses the federal prison system. Of the 2 million Americans behind bars in 2016, fewer than 200,000 were serving time in federal prison, according to the most recent data. The number of inmates has declined in recent years after skyrocketing since the 1980s.\n\nReform-minded advocacy groups like the ACLU and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights initially opposed the legislation, a version of which passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, because it gave prison officials too much discretion to decide which inmates deserve eligibility for pre-release custody, which can mean home confinement or placement in a halfway house.\n\nBut the Senate version of the bill won those groups over by adding several provisions reducing mandatory minimum sentences. One key addition would allow inmates serving time for a crack-cocaine offense to ask courts to give them the benefit of a 2010 law that reduced the huge imbalance between sentences for crack and powder cocaine, a disparity that disproportionately affected African-Americans. The First Step Act would make some 2,000 current federal inmates eligible for release by making the 2010 change retroactive.\n\nIt is a compromise of a compromise, and we ultimately need to make far greater reforms if we are to right the wrongs that exist in our criminal justice system. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)\n\nSome Democrats also said the package of reforms didn\u2019t go as far as they would have liked. But the entire Senate Democratic Caucus endorsed it nevertheless after changes were made to include the sentencing reforms \u2015 reforms Democrats viewed as necessary after decades of mandatory minimums and three-strike laws helped explode the country\u2019s prison population.\n\n\u201cIt is a compromise of a compromise, and we ultimately need to make far greater reforms if we are to right the wrongs that exist in our criminal justice system,\u201d Harris, a likely 2020 presidential contender, said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nAdvocacy groups, meanwhile, celebrated the vote as a key victory for criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cTom Cotton\u2019s scare tactics were a resounding failure,\u201d Jessica Jackson Sloan, National Director of #cut50, said in a statement. \u201cTonight, we stand as neither Republican or Democrats but as a people seeking to take the first step of many to criminal justice reform.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Fox News' Andrew Napolitano Eviscerates Trump As 'Loser' In Michael Flynn Case", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-napolitano-trump_us_5c1946c6e4b02d2cae8df862", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "While Fox News has cemented itself as a cheerleader for President Donald Trump, its star legal analyst trashed the commander in chief for defending former national security adviser Michael Flynn after it became known that he lied to the feds.\n\n\u201cThe message is the president ought to have known what Michael Flynn was up to at the time,\u201d Andrew Napolitano said on the network Tuesday. \u201cThe president is, so far, the loser in all this,\u201d the former judge added, noting that Trump \u201chas minimized what Gen.

But doctors at Dell Children\u2019s Medical Center in Austin now claim they can\u2019t spot traces of the life-threatening tumor on Roxli\u2019s MRI.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily rare to have this type of near complete resolution of this disease,\u201d Dr. Virginia Harrod, co-chief of the hospital\u2019s pediatric neuro-oncology department and one of Roxli\u2019s doctors, told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual and atypical and something we were all very pleased with.\u201d\n\nRoxli\u2019s parents told ABC affiliate KVUE-TV in Austin that they believe a divine miracle saved their little girl\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cEvery day we still say it,\u201d Gena Doss said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of our family thing that God healed Roxli.\u201d\n\nDIPG is a tumor that grows from glial cells, a type of supportive cell in the brain stem. This type of cancer usually affects children of elementary school age. According to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, about 10 percent to 20 percent of all childhood brain tumors are DIPG.\n\nSince the brain stem controls important bodily functions, kids with DIPG can experience trouble walking, swallowing and seeing.

Doctors at Dell Children decided to start radiation therapy, hoping it would help shrink or at least stabilize the tumor.\n\nRadiation has been shown to extend a DIPG patient\u2019s life by three to six months, Harrod said. But it is not a cure.\n\nHarrod said that she had a frank conversation with the girl\u2019s parents after the diagnosis, encouraging them to make the best of the time Roxli had left.\n\nRoxli received six weeks of radiation therapy. After giving her about four weeks to recover from the effects of that treatment, her doctors took another MRI scan in September to check the status of the tumor.\n\nThat\u2019s when Harrod noticed something unusual.\n\nThe tumor\u2019s response to the radiation treatment was \u201cremarkable,\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cThe tumor was absent and no longer measurable,\u201d Harrod said. \u201cWe barely saw any swelling or trace that a tumor had been there.\u201d\n\nSeton/Ascension Dr. Virginia L. Harrod is the co-chief of Pediatric Neuro-Oncology at Dell Children's Hospital.\n\nHarrod said she hasn\u2019t personally seen this response to radiation treatment in any of her own DIPG patients, although she\u2019s heard from other physicians that it\u2019s happened in a handful of cases.\n\nHarrod said she has a hunch that the positive outcome could be related to the biology of the specific tumor that was growing in Roxli\u2019s brain stem. But because that area of the body is very sensitive to biopsies, it would be hard for researchers to analyze the genetics and genomics of Roxli\u2019s tumor to understand why it responded so dramatically to radiation, while so many others do not.\n\nA biopsy isn\u2019t required for a DIPG diagnosis, Harrod said, and Roxli\u2019s family declined to have one done.\n\nHowever, the pre-teen isn\u2019t in the clear just yet. Harrod said that because this type of cancer has historically been extremely aggressive, doctors at Dell Children\u2019s have decided to continue treatment. Roxli is currently participating in a research trial and receiving medication to continue fighting the tumor.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to underestimate this tumor,\u201d Harrod said. \u201cWe need to be very vigilant in monitoring her and getting MRI scans going forward so that we can do our best to continue to make sure she\u2019s in the best health possible.\u201d\n\nHarrod said she and other doctors at Dell Children\u2019s are \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about what the tumor\u2019s disappearance means for Roxli\u2019s overall health. (Dell is part of Ascension, the largest Catholic health network in the U.S.)\n\nIn the meantime, Roxli\u2019s parents and supporters say they\u2019ve received the miracle they spent months praying for."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Despite Court Ruling To Eliminate Obamacare, States Plan To Expand Healthcare For The Poor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicaid-aca-healthcare-court_us_5c192b4de4b01954d9b0690a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Rick Bowmer/The Associated Press Utah voters approved a ballot measure in November to expand Medicaid in that state after years of contentious protests over the issue, including this one in 2017. Expansion would extend health care benefits to some 150,000 residents in Utah.\n\nBy Christine Vestal\n\nThe three red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 that bucked their own Republican legislatures last month and approved Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act are likely to proceed, despite Friday\u2019s ruling by a federal judge in Texas that the entire federal health care law is unconstitutional.\n\nVoter-approved Medicaid expansion would extend health care benefits to 91,000 low-income people in Idaho, nearly 90,000 in Nebraska and 150,000 in Utah.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in statute, so there\u2019s no turning back on it,\u201d Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat who has championed the plan, said in an interview Monday. \u201cThe only way we turn back on this is because it\u2019s repealed at the federal level.\u201d He said he\u2019s confident that won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t enact policy in our state because of pending court cases elsewhere, we\u2019d never enact policy,\u201d Morfeld said. \u201cThere are lawsuits on just about every federal program.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Utah\u2019s voter-approved Medicaid expansion is on track for swift implementation, according to Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, which supports the initiative. The state\u2019s Medicaid director is days away from submitting a so-called state plan amendment implementing the expansion. And the federal government is expected to approve it well in advance of its April effective date.\n\n\u201cWe see no reason to think the court decision will slow down the process in any way,\u201d Slonaker said. \u201cThis is a district court way down in Texas that is trying to be disruptive with very weak legal reasoning. Here in Utah, we\u2019re all systems go.\u201d\n\nIn Idaho, a Medicaid expansion referendum passed with over 60 percent of the vote, and had the support of the Republican governor, Butch Otter. In Nebraska and Utah, Republican governors opposed the expansion. (In Montana, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock supported the ballot measure that would have extended the state\u2019s temporary Medicaid expansion rather than rolling back coverage.)\n\nWith the three states added to the list, 36 states plus Washington, D.C., have now approved Medicaid expansion, likely adding pressure on the remaining states to do so.\n\nEven in Montana, where voters last month defeated an extension of the temporary Medicaid expansion approved in 2015, legislative leaders predict that lawmakers will make the expansion permanent, since it is politically unpopular to take coverage away from people once it has been extended.\n\nLate Friday, U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional because when congressional Republicans eliminated the penalty for Americans who do not carry health insurance as part of their broader tax overhaul, they invalidated the health law. In his 55-page opinion, O\u2019Connor pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the ACA based on the idea that Congress has the power \u201cto impose a tax on those without health insurance.\u201d\n\nWithout the penalty, O\u2019Connor argued, there is no tax, and therefore the law is unconstitutional. Legal analysts from both sides of the political spectrum have cast doubt on that logic, predicting the decision will be appealed. In the meantime, the ACA stays in place.\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic that Americans have made it clear that they want to expand access to care, not shrink it,\u201d said Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the Fairness Project, which helped bankroll the four state ballot initiatives.\n\nMontana voters defeated the Medicaid expansion ballot question this fall, but polls showed many were turned off by the idea of funding it with a tobacco tax; the tobacco industry spent mightily in opposition.\n\nNevertheless, Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature will be taking up expansion bills in January, and every bill is expected to get a chance at a hearing and a vote.\n\n\u201cThe legislature is very divided on this issue,\u201d said Montana Senate President Scott Sales, a Republican. Although he\u2019s trying to learn more about what Friday\u2019s court ruling might mean, he said, Democrats and the moderate wing of his party together likely have the votes to pass an expansion, though conservatives will work to impose cost-control measures.\n\nLen Nichols of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics cautioned that Friday\u2019s ruling gives \u201cammunition\u201d to expansion opponents who have raised concerns about the cost of expansion and whether the federal government will fulfill its pledge to cover 90 percent of the expense.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, it sows confusion, which may have been part of the goal,\u201d said Nichols, who served as a health care adviser to President Bill Clinton. \u201cIt does cast doubt on whether the law will survive.\n\n\u201cBetween the hard core opponents of the Affordable Care Act, the president\u2019s own ability to stir up opposition to it, and the fact that a number of people in the states are still opposed, it gives ammunition to those who want to delay.\u201d\n\nIn non-expansion states such as Kansas, where the Democratic governor-elect wants Medicaid expansion but the Republican majority legislature opposes it, the ruling could thwart or postpone any legislative plans to extend the low-income health care plan.\n\nIn Washington, Nina Owcharenko Schaefer, senior health policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an interview that the Texas decision highlights for states \u2014 particularly the ballot initiative states \u2014 \u201cthat things are still uncertain and they should proceed with caution as they look at the financial viability of this moving forward.\u201d\n\nWayne Hoffman, president of the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation think tank, counseled legislators to move cautiously in crafting the details of an expansion plan. Should the U.S. Supreme Court eventually strike down Obamacare and its federal match for states\u2019 Medicaid expansion, he warned, \u201cthe costs would increase substantially.\u201d\n\n\u201cState legislators and the governor certainly need to be mindful of the fact there is a pretty big moving target when it comes to costs,\u201d Hoffman said in an interview Monday. His group also has a lawsuit pending in the Idaho Supreme Court that would declare November\u2019s ballot initiative unconstitutional. Arguments in that case are scheduled for Jan. 29.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suggesting that legislators do nothing,\u201d Hoffman said, and \u201cthat they bide their time and that we wait at least for a state Supreme Court to make the ruling before we get into actual implementation of anything.\u201d\n\nHe figures lawmakers in other states are paying attention too. Should states have to fund Medicaid expansion entirely on their own, he said, exponential cost increases would eat into state needs such as public safety and education.\n\n\u201cI think most legislatures are in session in 2019, and so this is going to have to be something top of mind, and whatever you implement is going to potentially be implemented forever,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThe price is going to be going up and up \u2026 It\u2019s going to be one of the larger [decisions] that legislators would make.\u201d\n\nMontana state Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming House speaker, agreed that states will have to adjust their Medicaid expansions should the U.S. Supreme Court eventually strike down the Affordable Care Act."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Few Wells Are Tested For Contamination After Massive Flooding From Hurricanes Florence And Michael", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-wells-contamination_us_5c13c2ffe4b0cce3ea29d165", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Andrew Craft/Fayetteville Observer via AP A North Carolina home is flooded by Hurricane Florence. The storm dumped more than 30 inches of rain on the state.\n\nBy Rebecca Beitsch\n\nHundreds of thousands of homes in the Southeast may have had their wells inundated by record-level floodwater resulting from major hurricanes this year, yet only a fraction have been tested for harmful contaminants.\n\nThat\u2019s because North and South Carolina, Florida and Georgia \u2014 like most other states \u2014 don\u2019t require routine testing of private wells. Lawmakers have long been hesitant to put requirements on wells on private property.\n\nHurricanes Florence and Michael alone dumped more than 30 inches of rain on some areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina, creating a toxic soup that may have overwhelmed nearly 650,000 wells, according to estimates from the National Groundwater Association, an alliance of groundwater experts based in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nMore than 30 above-ground hog lagoons overflowed in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in September, sending pig waste into water inundating surrounding communities. Floodwater from Florence and Michael also contained agricultural runoff, fuel and other contaminants that can seep into the aquifer or flow into man-made wells through their ground-level ventilation systems.\n\nWithout data, though, scientists and public health officials won\u2019t know the full impact of the flooding on private wells.\n\nPublic health departments across the four states offered free well water tests to anyone affected by the hurricanes. Yet fewer than a thousand homeowners opted for water quality tests in each state, health departments said.\n\nAfter a natural disaster, relatively few people opt to get their water tested for contamination, often because they don\u2019t know there may be a problem or are afraid the results might hurt their home value. But even those who do may have never done so before, leaving many well water drinkers unable to pinpoint how long they\u2019ve been drinking bacteria-tainted water or the source of the contamination.\n\nThis is a particularly acute problem in North Carolina, where 2.4 million people rely on wells for their drinking water \u2014 the fifth-highest number in the nation, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and about a fifth of the state\u2019s population.\n\nThe state also is home to a high concentration of open pits filled with hog or chicken waste or coal ash, the residue from coal-fired power plants. That is joined by standard agricultural runoff, fuel and other contaminants picked up by floodwater.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s bacteria all over the ground,\u201d said Wilson Mize, an environmental health specialist with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 public health division. As waters rise, they inundate the above-ground portion of the well, which includes a small vent. \u201cIf you have over a foot of flooding, even on a perfectly constructed well, water is going to find its way in.\u201d\n\nA post-Florence recovery recommendation report from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said the state lab anticipated running 1,650 water tests, at a cost to the state of $36 each, but under 1,000 samples had been tested as of Nov. 30.\n\nResults from households that took advantage of the free testing show that in each of the four states, more than 30 percent of wells tested positive for coliform, bacteria that indicate surface water has entered a well. And in North Carolina, tests found that 13 percent of wells were contaminated with e. coli, a type of coliform associated with fecal matter.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with about 2 percent of wells that typically test positive for e. coli or other coliform in the Tar Heel State, the health department said.\n\nTravis Long/The News & Observer via AP A man helps his family move out of their flooded home in Kinston, North Carolina. Hurricane Florence flooded the Neuse River and devastated the town.\n\nNorth Carolina in 2008 began requiring new wells get tested shortly after they are constructed. South Carolina offers free \u2014 but voluntary \u2014 well water testing when a new well is constructed. Testing only at construction leaves older wells, potentially some of the most vulnerable to contamination, untested. Florida and Georgia have no testing requirements whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement under the law,\u201d said Chris Rustin, the director of environmental health at Georgia\u2019s Department of Public Health, adding that the state\u2019s lack of regulations is not unusual. \u201cIn most states, it\u2019s totally up to the homeowner to have the well samples and ensure water quality.\u201d\n\nGeorgia sampled 108 wells after Hurricane Michael hit in October, of which 43 percent were positive for coliform.\n\nMerritt Partridge, vice president of Partridge Well Drilling in Jacksonville, Florida, said his business usually gets more calls after a hurricane, often from people saying they heard on the news that their well might be contaminated. When he assures them that their well was unlikely to be affected unless their area was flooded, the tone of the call often changes.\n\n\u201cWe say it\u2019s always wise to get it tested, it\u2019s always good to know what\u2019s in your water, hurricane or not,\u201d Partridge said, \u201cBut that response almost always takes the edge off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen people say, \u2018Well how much is it? Is it worth it? I\u2019ve been drinking this water for the last 20 years,\u2019\u201d Partridge said, speaking of his experience after Hurricane Irma last year. \u201cSome people are drinking water that they shouldn\u2019t be, but they have no idea.\u201d\n\nTesting a well isn\u2019t very expensive, but a basic chlorine treatment that kills bacteria can cost around $500, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina was at greater risk of fecal contamination in wells than other states, in part because of the heavy rains that preceded Hurricane Florence, said Chuck Job, regulatory affairs manager with the groundwater association. He analyzed rainfall patterns from storms for the group to estimate how many wells were affected.\n\nCasey Toth/The News & Observer via AP Floodwater from Hurricane Florence creeps up on hog houses and a lagoon where hog waste is stored. At least 33 such lagoons overflowed during the floods.\n\nMost people with wells also rely on septic systems, which filter and store household waste underground. The two systems typically don\u2019t interact, Job said, but an already-saturated ground covered with floodwater might raise the water table, leaving the two systems \u201chydrologically connected.\u201d\n\nBut there could be other contributors of e. coli. At least 33 North Carolina hog lagoons overflowed because of rain from Hurricane Florence, according to the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s swine industry is concentrated in a part of the state uniquely vulnerable to its waste management practices,\u201d said Will Hendrick, a North Carolina-based staff attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental advocacy group. The hog lagoons are located mainly along the coastal plains, in an area with a high water table, high poverty rates and a large number of wells.\n\nHe pointed to a 2015 Johns Hopkins study that used genetic markers found in swine waste to determine hog lagoons were the source of contamination in nearby surface waters.\n\nBut some experts think hog lagoons are unlikely to be the source of contamination. Michael Burchell, an associate professor at North Carolina State University, joined scientists from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Virginia Tech, and the state, in testing well water for free for North Carolina residents affected by the hurricane.\n\nThe three universities targeted well users in areas with low testing rates, typically in communities with higher poverty rates and larger minority populations. Nearly a third of the 140 wells tested contained coliform.\n\nFloods mobilize all kinds of waste, Burchell said, including that of wild animals and pets. Usually flushing the well or using bleach or UV lights will solve problems tied to flooding.\n\nAndrew George, the community engagement coordinator with the UNC Institute for the Environment, went door to door with community leaders talking to people about the free testing being offered by the universities.\n\nMany homeowners are afraid to test their wells because of what they might find, he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hurt their property value.\u201d\n\nAlthough more than 130 wells tested by the North Carolina health department were contaminated with e. coli, it\u2019s not clear anyone got sick from drinking bad well water, though many stomach illnesses go unreported to county health departments.\n\nHurricane Florence contributed to some of the worst flooding Smith has seen. Even in a county defined by its swampland, most of the land became submerged as rivers and lakes overflowed.\n\n\u201cThere were several of our towns that were like islands during the storm,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just cut off.\u201d\n\nHendricks said the Waterkeeper Alliance and other environmental groups in North Carolina are pushing for the state to include funding to help people pay to get their wells tested more regularly as part of a hurricane recovery package.\n\nCooper outlined a proposal that estimated $100 million was needed to repair damage to the state\u2019s public water and sewer infrastructure but was silent on funding for well water tests."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gets Real About Self-Care, Burnout: 'It's NOT CUTE'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-gets-real-about-self-care-burnout-its-not-cute_us_5c18ffd1e4b02d2cae8d5bb6", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez revealed in a quirky Instagram post that she\u2019s taking time off for self-care in an effort to prevent burnout as she prepares to take her seat in Congress.\n\n\u201cI am starting a week of self-care where I am taking the week off and taking care of me.

It\u2019s like some kind of bizarre adult sleepover \u2015 except it\u2019s midday on a Friday afternoon, and from what I\u2019ve been told the next six hours could unfold into one of the most profound experiences of my life.\n\nThese days, it may not sound unusual for a 20-something to sign up for a four-day retreat with fifteen strangers in a foreign country to embark on a journey of \u201cself-discovery.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s probably a very millennial thing to do. This particular one had all the expected components: meditation, dancing, singing around a fire, breathing workshops ... and a whole day dedicated to drinking a tea infused with magic mushrooms.\n\nI\u2019m kidding \u2015 they weren\u2019t magic mushrooms, they were \u201cmagic truffles,\u201d an underground part of the mushroom that, curiously, has not been banned by Dutch law, which means that, along with cannabis, you can legally buy them in shops on the high street.\n\nThe retreats are run by the UK Psychedelic Society in the Netherlands and, as a filmmaker, I was participating for the purposes of research for a documentary about whether psychedelics can be an effective form of therapy.\n\nArriving in Amsterdam on a sunny afternoon, I met up with the group and was immediately taken aback by how many different accents I could hear. Compared to stories of plane journeys with multiple changeovers, my delayed four-hour Eurostar trip from London didn\u2019t seem so bad. We each bought two packs of vacuum-packed brownish blobs called \u201cHigh Hawaiians\u201d before heading to the retreat venue in the luscious Dutch countryside.\n\nSandwiched between several days of preparation and integration, the actual psychedelic experience takes place on Day 2. On the first day, participants meet and take part in exercises that gently, but thoroughly, prepare us for the enormity of what we are about to experience. We talk about our \u201cintentions\u201d for the trip, which range from pure curiosity, improving creativity or being a better parent to grappling with heartbreak, loneliness or coming to terms with a traumatic childhood.\n\nA morning movement workshop, individual check-ins, delicious vegan food and a sacred sage ceremony soon lull our anxiousness into a sense of security and safety. We are ready to take the \u201cplant medicine.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Hana Wolf The author photographed in the woods in the Netherlands during the retreat.\n\nFifteen minutes after gulping down the psychedelic tea, my eyes start streaming. I suddenly have no control over my tear ducts. Everyone else looks calm, but gradually emotions erupt and spread like dominoes on fire. People are laughing, crying, snorting, shaking. My heart beats rapidly, and my body temperature drops. I am a shivering, sobbing mess. Fortunately, the facilitators sense when you need reassurance, a hug, a blanket or food, and serenely float around the room helping us throughout our journeys.\n\nA specially curated playlist reverberates loudly on speakers, encouraging us to experience a range of emotions. It feels like a rollercoaster of existential purging, and wasn\u2019t long before I could not differentiate the music from myself \u2015 however odd it sounds. We were the same. Later, I could see the music in front of me as a physical thing: a bright yellow synaesthetic web of intricate pulsating patterns. I was entranced with delight and awe.\n\nBut before that there were moments of deep reflection and sadness, including a piercing realization that my family\u2019s and my own time on this earth is limited. I saw a cartoon cutout world of my childhood home from a bird\u2019s-eye view. Time swallowed the house, papering it over with trees, ignorant to my happy memories or the significance of it being my own roots. It seemed nature was reminding me of its omnipresence and ability to exist with or without us.\n\nNext was the experience of death \u2015 or rather, being engulfed by the universe and no longer existing in bodily form \u2015 while simultaneously feeling unified with everything. This experience of confronting one\u2019s own mortality is common in situations like this, and is one of the reasons psychedelics have been used in trials to help end-of-life cancer patients come to terms with their terminal diagnosis.\n\nI lost all grasp of time: a minute felt like hours, the days of the week were nonsensical words. I realized that, actually, I did not exist before this. I couldn\u2019t fathom how I was going to make a documentary that portrayed this experience, or indeed, go back to work at all. What even was my life? What was \u201clife\u201d as a concept at all?\n\nFifteen minutes after gulping down the psychedelic tea my eyes start streaming. Everyone else looks calm, but gradually emotions erupt and spread like dominoes on fire. People are laughing, crying, snorting, shaking. My heart beats rapidly, and my body temperature drops. I am a shivering, sobbing mess.\n\nI wondered how anyone had ever jumped off a bridge or balcony on this drug. Just sitting up took an inordinate amount of mental and physical strength. I sensed that my bladder was full and heaved my body to the bathroom with the help of a facilitator. I looked in the mirror and saw myself with gray hair \u2015 as an old lady. Then a baby-faced reflection \u2015 myself as a child. I giggled. What was my mind trying to tell me?\n\nBack in the room, I sat down and closed my eyes. This time revealed a vast expansive vision of delicate glass flowers in a white room. Each flower represented a living person, each one so unique and fragile. It reminded me that everyone is intrinsically valuable, and that vision remains one of the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed.\n\nCrucially, the days following the ceremony are dedicated to helping make sense of your trip and developing tools to positively integrate the experience into our daily lives. We hug, we walk in the woods, we write, we sing, we laugh, we cry and we share our deepest secrets. We have been to infinity and back together. Having been strangers just 36 hours ago, we are now firmly cemented into the fabric of each other\u2019s lives.\n\nThese isolated visions will not change your life; action is required for change. But they might ignite something within you, and for people with a mental illness that could be a lifeline. For people like my brother, who has suffered with severe OCD and depression for the best part of a decade, it could be an exciting alternative treatment option. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has recently granted \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d status to psilocybin (the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms / truffles) which should accelerate research for treating conditions such as PTSD and depression. And with clinical trial results looking very promising so far, some U.K. scientists predict that psilocybin-assisted therapy could be a part of the National Health Service as early as 2021.\n\nCourtesy of Rebecca Coxon The group takes part in integration exercises after the psychedelic ceremony.\n\nI remember telling myself during my trip that only those who really need to do this should do it. The first half of the experience was more intense, overwhelming and confusing than I could possibly put into words. That\u2019s also the reason many believe it could be helpful for those suffering with certain mental illnesses; it gives you a radical new perspective and breaks your habitual patterns, even if just for a few hours. This could be transformative for someone locked in the negativity of their own mind. It is important to note, however, that psychosis-based conditions should not be combined with psychedelics, as they could do more harm than good.\n\nDrugs are readily associated with addiction, and it\u2019s easy to park psychedelics in that group too. But from personal experience, talking to neuroscientists and filming other peoples journeys, it doesn\u2019t seem to be an experience that one rushes back to. In fact, rather ironically, scientists are now experimenting with psychedelics to treat addiction. What\u2019s more, a euphoric \u201chigh\u201d is not guaranteed, nor is it the high the kind typically associated with other drugs such as cocaine or heroin. Psychedelics are also generally inconveniently time-consuming affairs, with \u201cjourneys\u201d brought on by substances such as Ayahuasca and LSD lasting up to 15 hours.\n\nFor me, the experience has helped me to appreciate what I have and develop a deeper gratitude for it. When I went on to film the retreat the following month for my documentary, there were varying experiences. One attendee described it as \u201cone of the best things I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d while another admitted that her life had been \u201cshattered and turned upside down\u201d by the experience. She had expected to come out \u201ctotally healed\u201d of her problems, but soon realized that isn\u2019t quite how it works. The problem, or perhaps advantage, of psychedelics is that they are so wildly unpredictable. You simply don\u2019t know what they will offer up \u2015 or, indeed, how you will react to any insights that arise from the pits of your subconscious.\n\nRetreats like the one I experienced are popping up all over the world, and appealing to societies that are increasingly feeling disconnected, hopeless and fearful of each other. Coupled with health services that struggle to penetrate mental illness with any meaningful force, it\u2019s no wonder that people are deciding to take their mental health into their own hands.\n\nFor me, the experience can be described as like looking down the barrel of your whole life \u2015 but not in a linear, photo album kind of way, but more like a scattered scrapbook of your fears, hopes and hard truths.\n\nFittingly, for an experience that seems to connect random people so immediately and deeply, the breadth of human experience is truly witnessed at retreats like this. A broad spectrum of ages, religions, colors, cultures, genders and professions undertake the same journey under the same cozy roof. It almost makes me wonder if every war and conflict in the world could be nullified by gathering leaders into a room and connecting them through a psychedelic experience in this same way. But then I remind myself that this overly idealistic way of thinking is perhaps one of the reasons psychedelics were banned in the 60s ...\n\nFor me, the experience can be described as like looking down the barrel of your whole life \u2015 but not in a linear, photo album kind of way, but more like a scattered scrapbook of your fears, hopes and hard truths. For some people that will be appealing and feel necessary for healing. For others, it will sound like a nightmare.\n\nPsychedelics may not be the \u201cmagic pill\u201d for mental illness or the \u201ccure\u201d for a sick society that many of us are desperately hoping for, but it is impossible to deny their power. And with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nRebecca\u2019s documentary \u201cThe Mind Explorers: A Psychedelic Weekend\u201d is available to watch here."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.\n\nFacebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.\n\nThe F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.\n\nUnder the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment.

And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.\n\nCritically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.\n\nFacebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Data Sharing: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/facebook-data-sharing-deals.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-19 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "You are the product: That is the deal many Silicon Valley companies offer to consumers.

Both men were warned in advance not to lie to investigators and one brought a lawyer to his F.B.I. interview.\n\nThe judge speedily dismissed that comparison, repeatedly noting that Mr. Flynn was a high-ranking government official who had betrayed the government\u2019s trust by lying \u201cin the White House, in the West Wing.\u201d\n\nAlthough Judge Sullivan has a reputation for being hard on government misconduct, he found no fault with the conduct of the F.B.I. or prosecutors.

Both men were warned in advance not to lie to investigators and one brought a lawyer to his F.B.I. interview.\n\nThe judge speedily dismissed that comparison, repeatedly noting that Mr. Flynn was a high-ranking government official who had betrayed the government\u2019s trust by lying \u201cin the White House, in the West Wing.\u201d\n\nAlthough Judge Sullivan has a reputation for being hard on government misconduct, he found no fault with the conduct of the F.B.I. or prosecutors.
