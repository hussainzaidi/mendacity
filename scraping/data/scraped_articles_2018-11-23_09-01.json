But he was always drawn to North Sentinel Island off the coast of India, and the people there.\n\nThe Sentinelese live in isolation on the remote island in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, protected by Indian law to maintain their way of life and protect them from modern illnesses because they lack immunity. Chau took a scouting trip to the Andaman islands several years ago and told people of his desire to return, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey.\n\nChau's zeal to spread the Christian gospel took him back to the remote island, where he apparently was killed last week by tribespeople after trespassing, authorities said. Contact with the isolated tribe is prohibited. But those who knew the American missionary are calling him a martyr for the Christian faith.\n\n\"He was someone who died out of love for these people to bring the good news of Jesus Christ,\" Ramsey, 22, said in an interview Wednesday from Cologne, Germany.\n\n'We refuse to call him a tourist'\n\nIndian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26.\n\nChau came to India on a tourist visa but traveled to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October to proselytize, according to Dependra Pathak, director general of police of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\n\"We refuse to call him a tourist. Yes, he came on a tourist visa, but he came with a specific purpose to preach on a prohibited island,\" he said.\n\nJust more than a dozen people are believed to live on the island, which is a protected area. People are not allowed to go within 5 nautical miles of the island after previous instances of aggressive behavior toward outsiders. In 2006, the tribes killed two local fishermen.\n\nChau asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and find several fishermen and a water sports expert to help with the expedition, according to Pathak.\n\nThe fishermen said they used \"a wooden boat fitted with motors to travel to the island on November 15,\" Pathak said.\n\nThe boat stopped a little less than half a mile away and Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said. Chau returned later that day with arrow injuries. On November 16, \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe.\"\n\n\"So, he came back to the boat swimming. He did not come back on the 17th; the fishermen later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around,\" Pathak said.\n\nPolice haven't independently verified Chau's death, but they believe he was killed, based on the account of the fishermen. Authorities have yet to recover Chau's body.\n\n'He loved Jesus'\n\nRaised in Vancouver, Washington, Chau was first drawn to the outdoors after discovering a copy of \"Robinson Crusoe\" while in elementary school, he said in an article several years ago in The Outbound Collective , a website and app that helps people discover the outdoors.\n\nHe and his brother would paint their faces with wild blackberry juice and run around their backyard with bows and spears made from sticks, according to the article.\n\nChau graduated from Oral Roberts University, where he got involved with Covenant Journey, the Christian ministry that takes college students on immersion trips to Israel, according to Staver, who is the group's chairman.\n\nChau traveled to Israel with Covenant Journey, and to South Africa on missions with a group at Oral Roberts, Staver said.\n\n\"John loved people, and he loved Jesus. He was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people on North Sentinel island,\" Staver said in a press release. \"Ever since high school, John wanted to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with this indigenous people.\"\n\nIn the Outward Collective article, Chau spoke of his earlier adventures, including hiking Table Mountain in Washington state on Christmas break while in college.\n\nChau said going back to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was on the top of his adventure to-do list, the article said.\n\nChau knew the risks but it 'didn't frighten him'\n\nChau did not tell police of his intentions to travel to North Sentinel to attempt to convert its inhabitants, officials said. But he told a few people close to him, like Ramsey, who said Chau knew the island was a restricted area and his mission there was illegal.\n\nRamsey, who met Chau in August 2015 on a Covenant Journey trip to Israel, said they \"both had a passion for sharing our faith with others.\"\n\nWhen Chau returned from this scouting trip, Ramsey recalled Chau talked about his plans to return to the remote region, bearing gifts for the Sentinelese people. He said he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life, eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, Ramsey recalled.\n\n\"I kind of gathered that he would have been open to staying there for the rest of his life, but he didn't explicitly say that,\" Ramsey said.\n\nRamsey said Chau knew the risks, \"but it didn't seem to frighten him.\"\n\n\"He believed he was going to heaven, going to be with God if he died,\" Ramsey said.\n\nFor that reason, Chau didn't want anyone to come with him to the island and put their lives in danger, Staver said.\n\n\"He went back himself knowing that he would be in danger.\"\n\nNorwegian geneticist Erika Hagelberg described the larger group of Andaman Islanders as \"arguably the most enigmatic people on our planet.\" They are made up of several tribal groups, who were largely isolated until the island chain was turned into a British penal colony in the 19th century.\n\nSurvival International, a nongovernmental group that says it is dedicated to tribal peoples' rights, said Indian authorities should ensure outsiders not make contact with the tribe, because of the risk of disease or threats to their land.\n\n\"The Sentinelese have shown again and again that they want to be left alone, and their wishes should be respected,\" the group said. \"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survive. So, the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable.\"\n\n'This faith is worth dying for'\n\nIn a post on his Instagram page, Chau's relatives said: \"He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nThey remembered him as a beloved family member. To others, he was \"a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer,\" his family wrote.\n\nTo Ramsey, Chau is a modern-day Jim Elliot -- an American evangelical Christian who was killed in a mission in Ecuador in the 1950s. His friend may be able to reach more people in death than in life, Ramsey said.\n\n\"This can make a statement to the world that this faith is worth dying for, I suppose,\" Ramsey said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Isolated tribe encounters are usually violent", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/KHmzhLTW3us/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) They almost certainly won't know it, but the lives of a secluded tribe on an ultra-remote island in the Bay of Bengal have been thrown under a rare and unwelcome spotlight this week.\n\nAmerican missionary John Allen Chau appears to have been killed by the Sentinelese , an uncontacted tribe with a history of murdering unwanted intruders, which has no connection whatsoever with the outside world.\n\nThey represent some of the last people on earth whose way of life remains entirely undisturbed by modern civilization.\n\nBut they are not quite alone. There are around 100 such tribes that are known about around the world, said Jonathan Mazower of Survival International, which campaigns for the protection of isolated tribes.\n\nThe majority are found in the Amazon rainforest, while some lesser-understood groups exist in New Guinea, in forests and on islands elsewhere around the globe. These nomadic hunter-gatherers shun industrial society at any cost -- and on the occasions when modernity comes to them, the results are usually violent.\n\n\"Sometimes they will have in their collective memory a massacre, a violent incident, or a disease or epidemic -- so very often, there are well-founded reasons for these tribes to not want to have anything to do\" with the outside world, Mazower told CNN.\n\nWhen contact does occur, it can prove fatal -- tribespeople frequently attack intruders, and can also fall victim to common diseases like the flu, for which they have no immunity. \"Often, they are very fearful of outsiders -- with very good reason,\" Mazower said.\n\nSentinelese\n\nChau is not the first person to fall victim to the Sentinelese after intruding on their island, which it is illegal for outsiders to land on. In 2006, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding their home island, North Sentinel Island, after their boat drifted ashore, according to Survival International. Two years previously, in the wake of the ruinous 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, a member of the group was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nExpeditions were made to the island frequently in the 1980s and 1990s, where gifts were often left for its people, but these have since dropped off. According to India's 2011 census, only 15 Sentinelese were estimated to remain on the island. India's government has stuck to an \"eyes-on and hands-off\" policy to ensure that poachers do not enter North Sentinel Island, according to the country's Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\nKawahiva\n\nOften on the move through Mato Grosso, Brazil, this tribe left tools and pieces of their homes as the only clues to their existence for decades. But in 2013, a Brazilian government employee made a chance encounter with the group, capturing them on video for the first time. In the clip, members of the tribe walk through the forest naked and holding arrows , before fleeing when they sense an outsider nearby.\n\nBut this wasn't the only contact the Kawahiva have had with people from the outside world. \"There are thought to be probably no more than 30 left, the others having been massacred by campers and loggers,\" Mazower explained. And their future is an uncertain one, with the area surrounding their territory rapidly being cleared for agricultural work. \"Their situation is probably the most urgent now of any uncontacted tribe, because the part of Brazil where they live is extremely violent,\" he added.\n\nJavary River valley tribe\n\nIn August, another uncontacted tribe in the Amazon were caught on film for the first time. A drone camera caught tribespeople in the Javery River valley, although none appear to notice their observer. One of the figures carries a spear or pole, while four or five others stand near what seems to be a thatched structure.\n\nJUST WATCHED Never before seen Amazon tribe filmed by drone Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Never before seen Amazon tribe filmed by drone 00:46\n\nThe area along the Brazil-Peru border is home to many of the world's uncontacted groups. \"Its not that they've never had contact with the outside world -- they have contact with other groups around there, and they may be befriended to them or married into them,\" explains Evan Killick, a senior anthropology lecturer at the University of Sussex, who has studied tribes in the area. \"The reason they're isolated is precisely because of a history of violence and a history of exploitation,\" he said.\n\nXinane\n\nUnlike most uncontacted tribes, this group initiated a first-ever encounter with the surrounding world themselves. An extraordinary video released by Brazil's National Indian Foundation FUNAI shows the tribesmen, who live in Peru, leaving their dwellings to request bananas from nearby villagers.\n\nJUST WATCHED See tribe's first contact with outsiders Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See tribe's first contact with outsiders 01:00\n\n\"One of the young men asks the Brazilian officials, \"rani mi mulher?\" (where are your women?),\" explained Giancarlo Rolando, an anthropologist at the University of Virginia who has studied the tribe. \"In those videos, it is also possible to see a young man holding a rifle that apparently was seized from a group of outsiders that went into their territory.\"\n\n\"As many other Indigenous peoples of Amazonia, these peoples are bow hunters,\" he added. \"They also plant gardens, in their case the main staple is corn, though they also plant yucca and plantains. In addition, they fish and harvest forest products like mushrooms, fruit, medicinal plants, and palm leaves for roofing. Their traditional residential pattern is to live on longhouses, built on hill tops.\" Since that encounter, the Xinane have been relocated by FUNAI agents to a nearby settlement.\n\nWaorani\n\nIn 1987, a Roman Catholic bishop and a nun intending to spread the word of God met a fate similar to that of Chau at the hands of the Waorani, a group of native Amerindians in Ecaudor. Bishop Alejandro Lavaca and Sister Ines Arango were sacrificed by the tribespeople in brutal fashion, their bodies pinned to the ground by 21 wooden spears and their wounds stuffed with leaves to stop the blood flowing, the Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nMost of the tribe have since been contacted and many have been forced to relocate due to oil exploration on their land, Survival International says. The group has occasionally clashed with the nearby Taromenane, a small section of the Waorani which has continued to remain uncontacted -- especially in 2013, when two Waorani tribespeople were murdered by a member of the Taromenane group.\n\nAyoreo\n\nWhile most of the thousands-strong Ayoreo tribe have been contacted and have assimilated into mainstream society, the last few members who have remained isolated represent the last remaining uncontacted tribe in South America outside of the Amazon, Survival International says. Much of the group was forced out of their forest by American fundamentalist missionary expeditions in the 1970s, who would spot their camps from afar and make contact. \"In those encounters several people died, and many Ayorea died later due to diseases,\" said Mazower.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows last known member of native tribe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows last known member of native tribe 00:33\n\nDisease is a major threat to uncontacted tribes around the world. \"We're talking about things like flu or measles, because they have no antibodies or immunity, so they are very often fatal,\" he added. Dozens of Ayorea died from respiratory diseases in the 1980s.\n\nGroups like Survival International attempt to raise awareness of the plight faced by the little-known tribes, many of which are at risk from plantations, deforestation and violence.\n\nWhile the Sentinelese are protected by Indian laws which make it illegal to intrude on their island, most uncontacted people do not have the same fortune, their habitats instead being encroached upon by unwelcome outsiders.\n\n\"The most important challenge, by far, is to protect their land,\" Mazower said. \"That is the absolute essential. If their lands are protected, which is their right under international law, then there is actually no reason they should not continue to survive and thrive.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Fishermen saw tribespeople dragging, burying body", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TTC4O8Gtdkc/us-missionary-killed-tribespeople-north-sentinel-island-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "John Allen Chau, an American Christian missionary, was killed by a tribe of hunter-gatherers on a remote island off the coast of India, after officials say he tried to proselytize to the isolated community."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Tribe thought to have killed American is 'world's most isolated'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/dV3QkhyApxM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The tribe that appears to have killed American John Allen Chau on remote North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal is one of a number of vanishing peoples sealed off from the rest of the world.\n\nThe Sentinelese, as they're known, are protected by Indian law to preserve their way of life and protect them from modern illnesses to which they have no immunity.\n\nLaws banning outsiders from going within five nautical miles of the island are also there to protect strangers because the tribe, which has lived on the island for tens of thousands of years, has a history of forcefully repelling outsiders.\n\nTheir numbers have declined in recent years, but accurate counts are hard to obtain because the Sentinelese can only be observed from a distance due to the dangers in approaching the tribe.\n\nAccording to India's 2011 census, only 15 Sentinelese were estimated to remain on the island.\n\nDescribed as \"arguably the most enigmatic people on our planet,\" by Norwegian geneticist Erika Hagelberg, the wider group of Andaman Islanders, which comprises several distinct tribal groups, was largely isolated until the island chain was turned into a British penal colony in the 19th century.\n\nPort Blair, the administrative capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nFiercely isolationist\n\nFirst contact was made by the British in the late 1800s, when, despite their attempts to hide, six individuals from the tribe were captured and taken to the main island of the Andaman Island archipelago.

The tribe and their home are protected by Indian law to maintain their way of life and protect them from modern illnesses because they lack immunity.\n\nJust more than a dozen people are officially thought to live on the remote island, which about 50 kilometer (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, an Indian territory.\n\nThey represent some of the last people on earth whose way of life remains entirely undisturbed by modern civilization.\n\nThe island is a protected area, and people are not allowed to go within 5 nautical miles of it, after previous incidents of aggressive behavior toward outsiders were observed. In 2006, two local fishermen were killed by the tribes.\n\nChau did not inform the police of his intentions to travel to the island to attempt to convert its inhabitants, officials said.\n\n'God, I don't want to die'\n\nDependra Pathak, director general of police of the Andaman and Nicobar islands, told CNN that Chau had made several trips to the island, returning to the fishing boat at least twice.\n\n\"The boat stopped 500-700 meters (1,640 - 2,300 feet) away from the island and (Chau) used a canoe to reach the shore of the island. He came back later that day with arrow injuries. On the 16th, the (tribespeople) broke his canoe.\n\n\"So he came back to the boat swimming. He did not come back on the 17th; the fishermen later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around.\"\n\nWhile on board, he wrote one final note to his family.\n\n\"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people,\" it said. \"God, I don't want to die.\"\n\nDespite the reports from the fishermen claiming they had seen the tribespeople dragging Chau's body across the beach before burying it in the sand, his mother, Lynda Adams-Chau, told the Post that she believed he was still alive.\n\nAsked why, she answered, \"My prayers.\"\n\nPort Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar union territory.\n\nHistory of aggression against outsiders\n\nChau is not the first person to fall victim to the Sentinelese after intruding on their island, which it is illegal for outsiders to land on.\n\nIn 2006, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding North Sentinel Island after their boat drifted ashore, according to tribal advocacy nonprofit Survival International.\n\nTwo years previously, in the wake of the ruinous 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, a member of the group was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nAn image of a Sentinelese tribesman aiming a bow and arrow at a helicopter which was assessing the tribe's wellbeing in 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nExpeditions were made to the island frequently in the 1980s and 1990s, where gifts were often left for its people, but these have since dropped off.\n\nAccording to India's 2011 census, only 15 Sentinelese were estimated to remain on the island. India's government has stuck to an \"eyes-on and hands-off\" policy to ensure that poachers do not enter North Sentinel Island, according to the country's Ministry of Tribal Affairs."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "61% of Saudi Arabia's weapons come from one country", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/VMrGw0xLT5c/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A number of countries have restricted arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the kingdom began airstrikes on Yemen in 2015, in a war that the UN describes as the world's worst man-made humanitarian disaster.\n\nDenmark and Finland on Thursday became the latest countries to suspend new arms deals with Saudi Arabia.

An online petition , addressed directly to Girling, called the auction \"unethical\" and \"unsustainable,\" suggesting that the sale would stimulate poaching.\n\nThe petition, which had been signed almost 10,000 times at the time of writing, also claimed that the sale was \"quite likely illegal,\" and composed of \"horns from recently poached rhinos\" rather than antiques.\n\nScreenshot from an online Bonhams auction catalog made available to the public.\n\nGirling refuted such suggestions in his statement, claiming that all rhino carvings that pass through the auction house are antiques with \"known provenance\" and requisite licenses.\n\n\"Bonhams stands behind the professionalism and expertise of its specialists,\" he added.\n\nThe use of rhino horn in Chinese art and crafts dates back millennia. Carved cups, such as those featured in the Bonhams auction, were thought to protect their users from poisoning. It was once believed that rhino horn reacted with poison, producing a fizzing that would alert drinkers to danger.\n\nDetail of a carved rhino horn, which was, until recently, a widely used material in Asian arts and crafts.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) In October 1918, a swarm of smoldering fires flared and rode rising winds through 1,500 square miles outside Duluth, Minnesota. The flames incinerated cities, killed at least 450 people, and overtook evacuees as they fled in cars. It wasn't the last fire of a cycle that began in 1825 in Maine and migrated through the Lake States before moving on, but it was the last in which the fallen numbered in the hundreds.\n\nThen, over several decades, the scene calmed.\n\nThat former era of firestorms was sparked along the frontier. Settlers and logging companies felled the forests and left lands lathered in slash. They used fires widely to work the land into agriculture. They built houses and towns out of wood, and they lacked much incentive to prevent burning, or the capacity to fight the fires that blew up. Railroads cast sparks with abandon.\n\nYear after year, decade after decade, the sorrowful scenario repeated. But after the 1918 eruption, the rising tide ebbed.\n\nThis did not occur spontaneously. Cities gradually adopted fire and building codes and enforced them. They zoned in ways to halt fire spread and ensure egress. They installed a fire protection infrastructure.\n\nIndividual buildings and a town block burned here and there, but fires in cities no longer spread like fires in forests. The countryside also changed. Settlement ceased, and logging and its slash heaps were more or less domesticated. The wild and the settled were untangled into separate realms, routine burning on the landscape yielded to internal combustion, and firefighting agencies matured.\n\nBy the mid-20th century the horrific fires had faded, replaced with occasional outbreaks more akin to seasonal flu than an epidemic on the order of the Spanish flu (which, incidentally, had begun earlier in 1918).\n\nNow the flames are back. Why? Because the conditions that spawned the era of frontier fires have found modern surrogates. A new wave of settlement is recolonizing our formerly rural lands, this time converting to towns or exurbs, often out of materials similar to that of their surroundings. Building codes and zoning are often feeble, or have come decades after indifferent attention. Fire protection has strengthened, but it also eliminated, as a consequence, the \"good,\" smaller blazes that had formerly pruned back fuels that might otherwise feed a conflagration.\n\nThe countryside matured, sometimes in unhelpful ways because of the success of fire exclusion campaigns. Geographies that had been painfully segregated remixed as suburbs and pushed against wildlands, while urban enclaves and exurbs found themselves amid revanchist woods. Climate change lengthened fire seasons and worsened some of the conditions that allowed vegetation to convert into fuel. It assumed the role of performance enhancer that slash had earlier previously served. The fires mutated from occasional nuisances into menaces.\n\nThe problem manifested itself most dramatically in postwar California and was dismissed as a California quirk. Then it infected much of the American West with flames rushing around Spokane, Reno, the Wasatch Front, and -- with particular venom -- Colorado's Front Range. Then they moved into the Great Plains, then outside Austin, Texas, the coastal plains, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\nAt first, the prevailing narrative was one of dumb Californians (or westerners) putting houses where there were bound to be fires. Increasingly, thanks to climate change and land use, the narrative is becoming one of fires going to where the houses are.\n\nWhat can we do to turn the tide again? We can relearn the lessons of that last-century plague.\n\nMost basically, we need to define the problem correctly.\n\nThe \"wildland-urban interface\" is a dumb, geeky name coined in California in the early 1970s. It viewed the problem of wildfires from the perspective of wildlands. By then the wildland fire community -- that is, the federal agencies (such as the National Park Service and Forest Service) and some state and private institutions that were concerned with fire on landscapes -- had admitted the self-destructive folly of trying to exclude all fire from all lands and had committed to restoring \"good\" fire.\n\nIt defined the problem as one of encroaching houses and the loss of a rural buffer zone. It knew it could not eliminate all fires, and couldn't afford to, since in most landscapes fire was both inevitable and necessary. But it saw those fires getting more savage and knew that new houses compromised attempts to contain fires as a wildland issue.\n\nBut we might equally view the problem from the other side of the interface, that is, from cities and sprawling towns. Suburbs and exurbs are fringes and fragments of cities with peculiar landscaping. They are amenable to the methods that tamed America's urban blazes in that earlier era: fire codes, life safety codes, building codes, zoning, an infrastructure for urban fire protection.\n\nSuch a redefinition makes sense because plenty of research, not only in the US but in Australia and elsewhere, points to ember swarms as the primary ignition source in threatened communities. Blizzards of sparks from an advancing fire act on the structure itself and on the flammable material -- shrubs, mulch and pine needles --immediately around it. This \"home ignition zone,\"as it's called, holds the critical points of vulnerability. It's where fire enters the built environment.\n\nJUST WATCHED California Camp Fire sets grim new records Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California Camp Fire sets grim new records 01:20\n\nSimilarly, we know that fires occur in patterns -- as do winds, such as those blasting California -- and like flood plains, they map zones of high risk. They help identify what communities need the most urgent attention. (Malibu has burned so often, for example, it might make sense to highlight decades without a \"disaster\" fire.)\n\nYes, the countryside needs treatment as well. We can dampen the ferocity of the flames -- the size of fires will depend mostly on the winds, but their intensity will depend on the fuel characteristics of the landscape. The home ignition zone has a counterpart around whole communities -- a \"community ignition zone.\" There are lots of techniques for treating such areas, for fashioning the fire equivalent of greenbelts around communities and municipal watersheds.\n\nWe can also begin to substitute prescribed, semi-tame flames for the feral fires that now result from accidents, lightning, and power lines, which function today as railroads did a century ago.\n\nBut we need to choose solutions that make sense in terms of how fire behaves and kindles structures. Felling the woods will worsen the scene, unless you clean up afterwards. This can be expensive and brings its own hazards from burning the slash, which can lead to other fires and noxious smoke.\n\nWe can't stop winds and abolish vegetation and eliminate fires. We can make communities sufficiently resilient to accept those outbursts without burning to stone and killing residents.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe can go beyond thoughts and prayers, and the misbegotten sense that mass burnings must echo mass shootings in their random destruction and our helplessness to stop them.\n\nA century ago the horror of the 1918 outbreak marked a tipping point.

We're doing it over here.\"\n\nThe topic brought Trump to another familiar airing of grievances, as he complained over the phone to the general that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has \"become a big thorn in our side.\"\n\n\"It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border.

That's a big difference.\"\n\nTrump continued to defend his decision not to blame the crown prince or issue more severe punishments on a series of false or unsubstantiated claims, suggesting diminished relations with Saudi Arabia would cause \"a global depression,\" result in the loss of \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\" and leave Israel defenseless.\n\nTrump also defended his daughter, Ivanka, after it emerged earlier this week that she had used a private email account to discuss or relay official White House business, a practice evocative of the one for which Trump harshly criticized Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.\n\nHe called her use of personal email -- which appears to have violated federal records laws -- \"very innocent\" and dismissed the comparison to Clinton, saying his daughter's private emails contained no classified information and were never deleted.\n\nAt one point, Trump was asked what he was most thankful for on this Thanksgiving.\n\n\"For having a great family and for having made a tremendous difference in this country,\" Trump said. \"I've made a tremendous difference in the country.

The US Judiciary has strived to be above the political fray that has only been exacerbated by Trump.\n\nRoberts' response stems specifically from Trump's comments on Tuesday on District Court Judge Jon Tigar's Monday night decision to temporarily block an executive order that would have scaled back US asylum policy. Trump criticized the San Francisco-based Tigar, nominated in 2012, as an \"Obama judge.\" Of the regional US circuit court that would oversee any appeal of the case, Trump declared, \"an automatic loss\" for the administration and \"the 9th Circuit is very unfair.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, made public because of a query from The Associated Press, Roberts said, \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Roberts had been asked to comment, but it was the first time he decided to go public. A 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, Roberts did not explain his timing.\n\nBut it may arise from the combination of Trump's specific insult -- portraying Tigar in a political realm based on the president who appointed him -- as well as the recent confirmation turmoil over new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nRoberts' public concern for the reputation of the federal judiciary comes as the Supreme Court is riven 5-4 along ideological and political lines. The recent retirement of swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy has deepened the split, and Roberts has already signaled an effort to try to lessen the divisions among the nine.\n\nThe chief justice spoke out broadly about judicial independence in October after the tumultuous Kavanaugh hearings. Addressing a University of Minnesota audience, Roberts referred to \"the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\" and then asserted the high court's independence from the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\"I will not criticize the political branches,\" he said. \"We do that often enough in our opinions. But what I would like to do, briefly, is emphasize how the judicial branch is -- how it must be -- very different.\"\n\nRoberts' statement on Wednesday was of a different magnitude, stronger and deliberately echoing back the President's own remark about an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nThe chief justice has often expressed dismay when judges are referred to by political affiliation. He has also observed since 2010, with the retirement of liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, an appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford, that it may be more difficult to convince the public of justices' impartiality from politics.\n\nSince Stevens was succeeded by Obama-appointee Elena Kagan, and continuing with Trump's choice of Kavanaugh, the court's five conservative justices were named by Republican presidents and the four liberals -- often relegated to the dissent -- were named by Democratic presidents.\n\nWith Kennedy's retirement, Roberts is now ideologically at the middle of the court, and he may be inclined to hedge his own conservative instincts to steady the bench and avoid more polarization.\n\nAs he considered whether to answer Trump's latest affront to the judiciary on Tuesday, Roberts no doubt weighed how much he might provoke Trump. Roberts plainly concluded it was time to defend judiciary's special role in America's democracy.\n\nThe 63-year-old chief was likely not surprised that within three hours, Trump fired back in two consecutive tweets: \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' but if it is ... are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nRoberts offered no new retort. And given the chief justice's aversion to the appearance of politics, he is unlikely to offer any response any time soon."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Top Trump officials saved the President from himself", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/pyVrfCWQQck/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Had President Donald Trump been successful in launching prosecutions against Hillary Clinton and James Comey, it could have spelled the end of his presidency, as a clear-cut abuse of power.\n\nIt never happened, apparently thwarted by then-White House Counsel Don McGahn and other senior officials. But that does not mean this is a crisis dodged for Trump and he is now free from fresh legal and political jeopardy. Quite the reverse.\n\nAt the very least, the latest developments underline how Trump's senior subordinates may have shielded a President unschooled in constitutional norms from disastrous steps that could have put his presidency in peril.\n\nAnd it leaves anyone on the outside wondering what other potential disasters top officials like McGahn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein might have prevented.\n\nThey also raise questions about the capacity of a now-understaffed White House and legal counsel's operation to protect the President from current or future transgressions.\n\nIt will be impossible to confirm, given the habitual silence from the special counsel's office, but the revelations hint at the possibility that Robert Mueller knows much more about what went on in the corridors of the West Wing than has been publicly revealed.\n\nThat will play into rising tensions in Washington amid expectations that the endgame of Mueller's probe is in sight and speculation about possible indictments targeting Trump world and the content of his final report.\n\nBombshell reports by CNN and The New York Times about the President's intentions emerged on another surreal day in Washington that saw shocking disclosures about Ivanka Trump's emails and a huge foreign policy pivot over Saudi Arabia\n\nThey will bolster perceptions that Trump views the Justice Department as an instrument of his personal power rather than an insulated government department responsible for the neutral administration of justice.\n\nTrump had forecast his intentions\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that the President, on multiple occasions, asked Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then chief of staff to the attorney general, how they were doing in investigating Clinton.\n\nEarlier, The New York Times reported that Trump had asked McGahn to get the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and fired FBI Director Comey but that he had been rebuffed.\n\nThe paper, lifting the lid on extreme pressure faced by top law enforcement officials in the US government, also said Trump had repeatedly criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray for failing to more aggressively investigate Clinton, calling him weak.\n\nIt is not surprising that Trump would call for such prosecutions. He has frequently said as much on the campaign trail and on Twitter and beamed as his crowds chanted \"lock her up,\" referring to his 2016 election foe.\n\nBut that he would actually believe he has the power to follow through on his demands and such action would be politically acceptable is the most alarming takeaway from the reports.\n\nA prosecution of Clinton -- possibly over her private email server or an Obama-era uranium deal struck with Russia, both while she was secretary of state -- would have challenged the fundamentals of the political system itself. American democracy since George Washington, the first president, has been assured by the peaceful transfer of power between often bitter rivals. In a saga that became embroiled in the 2016 election, the FBI investigated Clinton's email use, but declined to recommend charges.\n\nMobilizing the government's prosecutorial powers against Comey would represent a vindictive swipe against a political enemy, a worrying sign in itself.\n\nBut it could also have led Trump onto perilous legal ground because he fired Comey and then told NBC News he had done so because of the Russia investigation -- which Comey was then leading -- raising concerns that the President had obstructed justice.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far 01:35\n\nThe dismissal made the former FBI director a key witness in the probe, which was taken over by Mueller shortly after Comey was forced out. Using the federal government to target such a witness would risk playing into the obstruction of justice case that Mueller is investigating, since it could offer evidence for the question of whether the President had acted with malicious intent.\n\nJosh Campbell, who served as an aide to Comey at the FBI and is now a CNN analyst, said his former boss was shaking his head at reports that the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him.\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said on \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\nComey wrote in his book \"A Higher Loyalty,\" which came out earlier this year, that Trump often reminded him of a mafia boss and sent him back to his days prosecuting the mob, especially with the President's demands for personal loyalty.\n\nRenewed scrutiny of Matt Whitaker\n\nThe latest revelations also cast new scrutiny on Whitaker, who is now acting attorney general, after Trump fired Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's elevation, and past criticism of the Mueller probe, sparked concerns that he was put in place to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nA source told CNN's Pamela Brown that Whitaker, in his former role, came to meetings with Trump prepared to answer how the Justice Department was pursuing investigations against the Clinton Foundation and on the Uranium One issue, over a mining company whose sale to Russia's atomic energy agency had been approved by the Obama administration while Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe source said Whitaker tried to appease the President and there was no sign that he had crossed a line.\n\nWhitaker is now in a role in which he oversees the Mueller probe, and thus could face intense pressure from a President who has made no secret of his disdain for an investigation he has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhen Trump first requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, the Times said. The paper also reported that McGahn had gone so far as to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a request.\n\nIn many ways, the latest reports underline how Trump, a neophyte in Washington when he was inaugurated in January 2017, does not appreciate or respect normal boundaries between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nThey also suggest how if he is not constrained, the President could accidentally stumble into a position that contravenes the Constitution and puts his presidency in jeopardy.\n\nThat possibility seems to be exacerbated by Trump's increasing self-confidence in a White House that may be about to be deprived of many remaining restraining influences in a government reshuffle.\n\nTuesday's reports recalled an exchange in a Clinton/Trump presidential debate in 2016, when the Democratic nominee remarked that it was good that someone with her rival's temperament wasn't running the country.\n\n\"Because you would be in jail,\" Trump replied."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Thanksgiving dinner: How to find common ground on divisive issues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/I70zlsivI3w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It looks like it's going to be a perfect Thanksgiving. The sides are plentiful, and the turkey is juicy.\n\nThen Uncle Seymour brings up politics. Everyone at the table freezes because half the family leans to the left and half leans to the right.\n\nA suave cousin could steer the conversation toward something less controversial, but sometimes you just can't avoid politics.\n\nHere are five thorny issues that could come up on Thanksgiving Day and how you and your family could find common ground:\n\n1. Gun control\n\nGuns are one of the most polarizing issues in our nation. A slight majority (52%) in a recent Pew Research Center poll believed it was more important to control gun ownership than the 44% who said it was more important to protect Americans' rights to own guns. There is a large gender and partisan gap on the issue. It also splits along urban and rural lines.\n\nFar less controversial is preventing people with mental illness from owning guns. In the Pew poll, 89% of Democrats and 89% of Republicans favor this proposal. A Fox News poll, which phrased the question slightly differently, found that 84% of voters (including 89% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans) favor mental health checks for all gun purchases. One of the big changes to Florida law following the Parkland shooting was to beef up mental health checks . This law was passed with bipartisan support and over the objections of the National Rifle Association.\n\n2. Health care\n\nThere has probably not been a more important issue in American politics than health care over the last decade. Democrats passed Obamacare, which played a major role in Republicans taking control of the House in the 2010 midterms. Republicans then tried to repeal Obamacare, which, in part, led to Democrats winning back the House majority in 2018. More Americans like than dislike the law at this point, though it's still divisive\n\nIt's best to focus on the parts of Obamacare that tend to have much higher support. Specifically, Americans of all political stripes are for ensuring that those with pre-existing conditions get covered. In August, the Kaiser Family Foundation asked Americans how important it was to maintain the law that \"prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage because of a person's medical history\" and \"prohibits health insurance companies from charging sick people more.\" Overall, 75% and 72% respectively said it was very important. Even among Republicans, 58% and 56% said it was very important.\n\n3. The Republican tax cuts\n\nSome thought Republican tax cuts passed by this Congress were going to help them maintain their House majority. It didn't. The law has remained relatively unpopular , and it may have cost Republicans House seats in places where residents were hurt by them.\n\nIt's best to steer to conversation toward a tax cut most people support. One reason the Republican tax cut wasn't popular was that most voters thought it was aimed primarily at the upper class . Americans are far more in favor tax cuts in which the middle class would benefit more. During the heat of the tax cut debate last year, 60% of Americans said in a CBS News poll that they would like to see taxes on the middle class decreased. Unlike most other proposals CBS News polled, a tax cut for the middle class received bipartisan support with 69% of Republicans, 57% of independents and 56% of Democrats in favor of one.\n\n4. Immigration\n\nThere have been few issues as polarizing as illegal immigration over the last few years. Indeed, when I looked at which issues generated the greatest difference in response from Democrats and Republicans, the yearning to build a wall along the US-Mexico border came in at No. 1. In an October CBS News poll , 76% of Republicans favored building a wall compared to only 9% of Democrats.\n\nFocus instead on legal immigration. Democrats and Republicans do generally agree on this topic: they like it. In a 2018 Gallup poll , 92% of Democrats said legal immigration is a good thing for the country. Among Republicans, 80% said immigration is a good thing for the country. According to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of Americans who want legal immigration decreased has dropped to 24% (a low since at least 2001). Decreasing legal immigration is a minority position among Democrats (16%) and Republicans (33%).\n\n5. Washington politicians\n\nBringing up President Donald Trump at a family gathering is like wearing a New York Yankees shirt in Boston. It's bound to set off long stares and start potential fights. Trump is loved by Republicans and despised by Democrats. Mentioning Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is probably not going to end much better."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Thanksgiving: Watch out for these illnesses tied to recalled foods", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/i0SRD3w4u3Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is many Americans' favorite holiday because it is a time when family, friends, neighbors and strangers come together to share their favorite foods. Before you prepare your favorite dishes, take a moment to review the food recalls and illness outbreaks identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRomaine lettuce\n\nJust two days before Thanksgiving, the CDC warned US consumers to not eat romaine lettuce , as it may be contaminated with E. coli.\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC. One of the hospitalized people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially life-threatening form of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.\n\nPeople have become sick in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has identified an additional 18 people who have become sick with the same strain of E. coli in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, which also is investigating the outbreak, cautions that if you have any romaine lettuce at home, you should throw it away, even if you have eaten some and did not get sick.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted Thursday that the agency continues to investigate the source of the outbreak. \"We believe it's related to lettuce harvested from California. We hope to have more information by Monday isolating the growing region.\"\n\nGottlieb said the key is to get the current stock off the market and restock with new produce. Romaine lettuce will be harvested soon in Florida, Arizona and other regions.\n\nNo one distributor or source has been identified, so the FDA is warning consumers to avoid all types and brands of romaine lettuce. Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nTurkey products\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak. The CDC announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported, though 21 people have been hospitalized, the public health agency reports. The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella illness usually begin 12 to 72 hours after consuming something tainted with the organism and last about four to seven days. They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Don't eat romaine lettuce, CDC urges amid E. coli concerns", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/L5eJjqoKvEI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned US consumers on Tuesday to not eat romaine lettuce, as it may be contaminated with E. coli .\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC.

Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants also should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nA similar outbreak caused by contaminated romaine lettuce occurred in December, Gottlieb said, and affected the United States and Canada. \"The strain in 2017 is the same as the strain in this fall 2018 outbreak, and the time of year is exactly the same. So It's likely associated with end of season harvest in California,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different this year is that the FDA has higher confidence that it's romaine lettuce in both countries. \"This year, we're a month earlier, so we're earlier in the process, earlier in the throes of an outbreak,\" Gottlieb said. \"So we're able to actually get real-time information and conduct effective trace back and isolate what the source is.\"\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness.\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, according to the US Food and Drug Administration , which is also investigating the outbreak. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\n\"That's why we think it's critical to get this information out,\" Gottlieb said. \"We understand fully the impact this has, not just on the growers and the distributors but also on consumers -- consumers who are preparing meals for the holidays, who have product now that they're going to need to discard, maybe food that they've already cooked.\"\n\nHow does the US prevent foodborne illness?\n\nFoodborne illness hits one in six Americans every year, the CDC says, estimating that 48 million people get sick due to one or another of 31 pathogens. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die annually.\n\nPreventing foodborne illness in the United States is the job of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which oversees the meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and the FDA, responsible for domestic and imported foods.\n\nWith frequent news of outbreaks, which are investigated by the CDC, many people might wonder whether foodborne illness is on the rise -- and whether safety measures across the nation adequately protect our food supply.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the CDC has investigated 21 multistate foodborne illness outbreaks this year, more than any year in the past decade.\n\n\"I think that the issue isn't that there's more unsafe food,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think what's happening is that we have better technology than ever before to link outbreaks of human illness to a common pathogen.\"\n\nIn all 50 states, the CDC has the capacity to do genomic testing on samples from infected patients (such as blood samples). It also can genetically link the identified pathogens in human illness to actual food sources.\n\nWhat is lagging is the ability to do track and trace to a single distributor or grower \"because we don't have as good a technology as we would like in our supply chain,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother recent development in protecting the US food supply is the Food Safety Modernization Act , which became law in 2011. Gottlieb said the act represents a \"paradigm shift,\" as it is based on prevention instead of reaction.\n\n\"I think food is more safe now than it's ever been. We have much more resources and additional tools to do effective surveillance.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Romaine' calm: Funny and meaningful memes to 'lettuce' get through this recall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/zR3r1PvT6wg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Spinach.

The EPA told CNN that \"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations ... and therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water.\"\n\nConcerned residents asked Virginia Tech researcher Marc Edwards to test their water supply last year. He discovered that HaloSan was being used to treat the city's water when he read it in a May water quality study done by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. \"I've never once seen it used in a public water supply,\" he said.\n\nEdwards is known for his work helping to reveal high levels of lead in the water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThe residents say they'd been seeing rusty-colored water for years.\n\nBakari Sellers is an attorney who filed one of the suits on behalf of residents.

They've had brown water for a long time.\n\n\"It's hard to bring in industry because of the water, and I understand the dilemma of the city,\" he said. \"They don't have the resources to fix the problem.\"\n\nThe second lawsuit, brought by attorney John Harrell, was filed against the City of Denmark, along with Denmark's Public Water System.

He says he is also assessing whether another suit is possible.\n\n\"I am confused by the similarities of the illnesses in the people of this small city,\" he told CNN. \"I am perhaps more confused by the lack of more active pursuit by the local and state government in fixing the situation.\"\n\nBut prior to the lawsuits, Wright told CNN that he's done everything possible.\n\n\"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves.

Twice I paid for professional cleaning and gave the receipts as proof, and still I was charged for cleaning.\"\n\nAsk any group of renters about their experiences and at least some of them will have similar stories. Private renting has more than doubled in the past 20 years and home ownership among middle-earner millennials has collapsed.\n\nShelter has said tenants are routinely being overcharged. It lists examples of tenants paying as much as \u00a320 an hour for their landlord's time, \u00a345 for procuring a replacement dustpan and brush - and even \u00a3100 for removing cobwebs. None of those charges will be banned by the Tenant Fees Bill.\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of the charity, says she will welcome the new rules but tells BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money it must go further.\n\n\"What we need is clearer guidelines on what tenants can and can't be charged for, otherwise agents and landlords could keep finding additional things that they can charge tenants for so we want it to be a bit tighter,\" she says.\n\n\"Letting agents are running a business and their business is managing properties. So they ought to be able to calculate the general costs that they will incur in the course of their business and not charge people surprise fees for things that you might think either are too petty and shouldn't be charged for - or should be part of the totally predictable cost of managing a property.\"\n\n'Reasonable balance'\n\nTenants may feel ripped off by these fees but letting agents and landlords argue they genuinely reflect the cost of the work.\n\nOne letting agent, who did not want to be named, said: \"To get anyone to show up at your door no matter what they do is \u00a350 or something in that region. So, if a tenant is to leave a bit of fluff somewhere, someone still has to take an hour to go there, do it and come back and you have to hire a professional.\n\n\"I used to own a property and I wouldn't just run out to clear up a bit of fluff or change a bulb, I'd say it's my tenants' responsibility.\"\n\nImage caption 11.5m people rent in England\n\nHis comments were echoed by housing minister Heather Wheeler. \"I genuinely think that you have a responsibility when you take on a property - you expect it to be in good order when you arrive, it's your job to make it in a good order when you leave. It's your money, it's your deposit. If you want it back then you leave it in a good state.\"\n\nRichard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association, said the new rules will curb abuses. \"Default fees will have to be a reasonable charge for a defined purpose. But if I have to come to you to change a lightbulb then I have to drive for half an hour, plus petrol, to carry out the work. I wouldn't be charging you anything more than what it cost me.\n\n\"The government has tried to strike a reasonable balance with tenants and landlords to ensure they can carry out their business reasonably, while also stopping any abuse of the system.\n\n\"What the tenant fees bill does address is a particular abuse that has grown up over the last 10 years where some agents - not all - have taken every opportunity to squeeze every penny out of the sector.\"\n\nShelter will be answering questions about renting costs on the BBC Affordable Living Facebook Page\n\nHear more on BBC 5 live Wake Up To Money Podcast"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "The village that's eradicated FGM", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46309516", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:19", "body_paragraphs": "Video\n\nIt started when one family decided not to circumcise its women 30 years ago.

But she tells BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money there were \"also \u00a3875 worth of letting agent fees, \u00a3600 were admin fees, \u00a3120 for employers' references for both me and my partner, and \u00a3155 for an inventory check-in fee as well\".\n\nCharlotte is one of the estimated 11.5 million people who live in private rented homes in England.\n\nMany renters complain of high upfront costs to secure a property and the Tenant Fees Bill passing through parliament will effectively cap or ban these extra, unavoidable charges for tenants in England.\n\nWales has similar legislation underway and Scotland outlawed pre-tenancy fees back in 2012.\n\nIn Northern Ireland it's a more complicated picture. A judge recently ruled that tenants could not be charged upfront costs, but without a sitting assembly to bring in new rules, tenants there are still paying them.\n\n'Frustrating experience'\n\nBut those pre-tenancy fees are just one part of the hidden costs for renters and a number of tenant campaign groups, including Shelter and Generation rent, have expressed concern that banning them will not solve the problem.\n\nWhen the new rules eventually come into force, they will not stop landlords and letting agents from charging default fees, such as cleaning costs or for repairs. While those are often for work needed after tenants leave a property, some tenants report being charged huge amounts for tiny jobs. Some tenants say they feel ripped off.\n\n\"I've just ended 10 years of renting [and] each property was its own frustrating experience,\" says 30-year-old former renter Jen Eastwood.\n\n\"Never once have I received a full amount of deposit back, despite every property being returned in a better condition than when it was given to me. Twice I paid for professional cleaning and gave the receipts as proof, and still I was charged for cleaning.\"\n\nAsk any group of renters about their experiences and at least some of them will have similar stories. Private renting has more than doubled in the past 20 years and home ownership among middle-earner millennials has collapsed.\n\nShelter has said tenants are routinely being overcharged. It lists examples of tenants paying as much as \u00a320 an hour for their landlord's time, \u00a345 for procuring a replacement dustpan and brush - and even \u00a3100 for removing cobwebs. None of those charges will be banned by the Tenant Fees Bill.\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of the charity, says she will welcome the new rules but tells BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money it must go further.\n\n\"What we need is clearer guidelines on what tenants can and can't be charged for, otherwise agents and landlords could keep finding additional things that they can charge tenants for so we want it to be a bit tighter,\" she says.\n\n\"Letting agents are running a business and their business is managing properties. So they ought to be able to calculate the general costs that they will incur in the course of their business and not charge people surprise fees for things that you might think either are too petty and shouldn't be charged for - or should be part of the totally predictable cost of managing a property.\"\n\n'Reasonable balance'\n\nTenants may feel ripped off by these fees but letting agents and landlords argue they genuinely reflect the cost of the work.\n\nOne letting agent, who did not want to be named, said: \"To get anyone to show up at your door no matter what they do is \u00a350 or something in that region. So, if a tenant is to leave a bit of fluff somewhere, someone still has to take an hour to go there, do it and come back and you have to hire a professional.\n\n\"I used to own a property and I wouldn't just run out to clear up a bit of fluff or change a bulb, I'd say it's my tenants' responsibility.\"\n\nImage caption 11.5m people rent in England\n\nHis comments were echoed by housing minister Heather Wheeler. \"I genuinely think that you have a responsibility when you take on a property - you expect it to be in good order when you arrive, it's your job to make it in a good order when you leave. It's your money, it's your deposit. If you want it back then you leave it in a good state.\"\n\nRichard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association, said the new rules will curb abuses. \"Default fees will have to be a reasonable charge for a defined purpose. But if I have to come to you to change a lightbulb then I have to drive for half an hour, plus petrol, to carry out the work. I wouldn't be charging you anything more than what it cost me.\n\n\"The government has tried to strike a reasonable balance with tenants and landlords to ensure they can carry out their business reasonably, while also stopping any abuse of the system.\n\n\"What the tenant fees bill does address is a particular abuse that has grown up over the last 10 years where some agents - not all - have taken every opportunity to squeeze every penny out of the sector.\"\n\nShelter will be answering questions about renting costs on the BBC Affordable Living Facebook Page\n\nHear more on BBC 5 live Wake Up To Money Podcast"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "UK pledges \u00a350m to help end FGM in Africa", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46307572", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:33", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One family is responsible for ending FGM in an entire village in Sudan\n\nThe UK is to give \u00a350m ($64m) in aid money to help stop female genital mutilation (FGM) in Africa.\n\nThe government says this is the biggest single investment to date in the world to help end FGM by 2030.\n\nThe practice involves removing all or part of a girl or woman's external genitalia, including the clitoris, with some treating it as a rite of passage.\n\nActionAid welcomed the funding but said focusing on FGM alone \"was not enough\" to eradicate violence against women.\n\nThe aid package will help fund organisations such as the Saleema project in Sudan, which aims to show girls they can feel empowered if they are left uncut as well as trying to shift the attitudes of older members in the community.\n\nMinisters have said the money will also have a beneficial effect in the UK as it will be used to help reduce the risk of girls being taken abroad to be cut.\n\nFGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and further legislation in 2003 and 2005 made it an offence to arrange the practice outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents.

Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK.\n\nA few points to remember\u2026\n\nThis is not a legally binding document.\n\nIt's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified).\n\nThis is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes.\n\nFormal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019.\n\nIt contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come.\n\nHere's an initial look at what's in the text:\n\nFuture relationship\n\nA reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours.\n\nBoth sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead.\n\nAgain, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like.\n\nAnd no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate.\n\nBottom lines\n\nThe bottom line of both parties is included early on.\n\nAnything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\n\nAnd nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated.\n\nTrade in goods\n\nSo trade in goods should be \"as close as possible\", but that's not the same as being frictionless.\n\nIt leaves a lot of wiggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome.\n\nThe two sides are committing themselves to an \"ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced\" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement.\n\nBut there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition.\n\nThe more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up.\n\nCustoms\n\nWhen the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit.\n\nDominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world.\n\nThe government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as \"rules of origin\".\n\nThe declaration also mentions explicitly an \"independent trade policy\" for the UK in the future.\n\nIrish border\n\nWe are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open.\n\nThat includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long.\n\nThe trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world.\n\nRegulations\n\nUK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come.\n\nIt makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between.\n\nBut none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific.\n\nTrade in services\n\nAs expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of \"equivalence\" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020.\n\nThere's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim.\n\nThere are also plenty of aspirational words on \"ambitious and comprehensive\" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate.\n\nDigital commerce\n\nThere are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data.\n\nThe UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy.\n\nBut the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nThis fulfils the Prime Minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop.\n\nThe document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.\n\nFishing rights\n\nThere is neutral language here, including the \"best endeavours\" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal.\n\nBut that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters.\n\nExpect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest.\n\nSecurity\n\nThere is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation.\n\nThe EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome.\n\nWe can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future.\n\nDisputes and courts\n\nRather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel.\n\nBut once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end.\n\nTiming\n\nThere is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on.\n\nBoth sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Fiona Bruce 'in talks over taking Question Time job'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46312297", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:38", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nFiona Bruce is in talks about taking over as presenter of the discussion programme Question Time.\n\nBBC media editor Amol Rajan said negotiations with Bruce, who presents the News at Six and Ten as well as the Antiques Roadshow, were continuing.\n\nCurrent host David Dimbleby will leave the show in December after 24 years.\n\nIf Bruce succeeds Dimbleby, she will become the first full-time female host in the show's 40-year history.\n\nThe BBC's media editor said Bruce auditioned alongside several other leading broadcasters at the corporation for the job.\n\nSenior figures at the BBC were known to want an established figure who had experience on BBC One, our correspondent added.\n\nBruce has worked at the BBC since 1990, when she began her career as a researcher on Panorama.\n\nThe 54-year-old went on to become a reporter on the programme and also on Newsnight.\n\nBruce also co-hosted Crimewatch on BBC One for eight years.\n\nIn 2001, she became the first female presenter to be part of the BBC's general election studio team."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: A guide to where we are", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46192884", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit: What just happened?\n\nTheresa May has agreed a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement and a political declaration about future relations between the UK and the EU. It hasn't been painless - two cabinet ministers and two junior ministers resigned while some Conservative MPs want to force a leadership contest. What happens now?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice.\n\nMrs May announced that a deal had been reached, and approved by cabinet, last week. But two cabinet ministers have since resigned.\n\nThe deal would also need to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWhat has been agreed between the UK and EU?\n\nA draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU.\n\nIt is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. They have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.\n\nSo what about a trade deal?\n\nAlongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is that 26-page \"political declaration\" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like. This is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.\n\nThe political declaration envisages \"a free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas\". There would be \"ambitious customs arrangements\" that \"build on\" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop. Here's our Reality Check team's view of the key points of the declaration\n\nHave they solved the Irish border issue?\n\nThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nSo they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThat will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.\n\nThe backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nBut this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.\n\nMrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nThey could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When will Brexit happen?\n\nWhat else is in the agreement?\n\nCommitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members\n\nA proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure\n\nA \"fair financial settlement\" from the UK - also known as the \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\"\n\nProtection for 3,000 \"geographical indications\" including Parma ham, feta cheese, champagne and Welsh lamb\n\nWho resigned?\n\nDominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over \"fatal flaws\" in the draft withdrawal agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU \"blackmail\".\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department. Others to go were Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara and Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.\n\nIs there going to be a leadership challenge?\n\nA number of Conservatives have said publicly that they have written letters to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee, made up of backbench MPs - saying they have no confidence in Mrs May's leadership.\n\nThese include the head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and former minister John Whittingdale. Party rules say that if Sir Graham receives 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of MPs - it will trigger a vote of confidence.\n\nIf Mrs May wins that a secret ballot, she would be immune from another challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Sir Graham will not reveal the number of letters he receives until he gets to that magic number. More than a week after the rebels went public it seems they have failed to get to the 48 figure.\n\nIt is not yet clear how any of this will affect Brexit and the outcome of talks.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nAn emergency EU summit is due to be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.\n\nWhat about the Commons vote?\n\nIf it hasn't been tricky enough already for Mrs May, probably the most difficult part comes if and when the UK government and the EU have agreed on their preferred Brexit deal.\n\nShe then has to persuade MPs to vote for it. Any vote is expected to take place in the first half of December.\n\nMrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it.\n\nIf Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out. On Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was \"no question\" of reopening talks.\n\nMrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, \"nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow\" and it would mean taking \"a path of deep and grave uncertainty\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse.

Indeed, they could even be using social media for support.\n\nAdolescence is key\n\nThe majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders.\n\nThese are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time.\n\nUniversity College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: \"Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years.\n\n\"Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people.\"\n\nHow many children get help?\n\nThe NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital.\n\nThat is fewer than 3% of the population.\n\nThe figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away.\n\nThis could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams.\n\nBut Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them.\n\nHer report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months.\n\nWhat needs to happen?\n\nThe commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around \u00a3700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support.\n\nBy comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population.\n\nThe commissioner said an extra \u00a31.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line.\n\nShe said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example.\n\nEmma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children.\n\nShe said the charity gets \"calls every day\" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help.\n\n\"This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need.\"\n\nShe agreed early intervention and better funding were essential.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nBoth NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority.\n\nIn fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access.\n\nLast month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least \u00a32bn of the extra \u00a320bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health.\n\nA new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years.\n\nNational mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of \"ramping up\" access to services.\n\nShe said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment.\n\n\"Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing.\"\n\nMinisters have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online.\n\nOne option being considered is a new regulator for the internet."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Family size shrinks to record low of 1.89 children", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46303120", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:46", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright shapecharge Image caption More women are having just one child\n\nThe number of children women are having is continuing to decline, to a record low of 1.89, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nIts study compared two groups of women: those born in 1972, who are now in their 40s, with those born in 1945, who had an average of 2.19 children.\n\nThe numbers of families in England and Wales with just one child grew from 14% to 18%.\n\nChildlessness also increased in women, from 10% to 18%.\n\nWhat's driving the decrease?\n\nPamela Cobb, an ONS statistician, said: \"Women are delaying childbearing, from their 20s to their 30s.\n\n\"This might be due to participating in higher education, partnering or marrying later, or waiting until they are financially secure.\n\n\"This could lead to fewer children, partly because there is less time.\n\n\"For some, there is also an element here of a lifestyle decision.\"\n\nAnother factor is the continuing decline in teenage pregnancy.\n\nIn the 1945 group, 17% of women had at least one child by the age of 20.\n\nBy 1972, this had come down to 13%.\n\nFertility rates are also rising for women aged between 40 and 45, although the numbers overall remain small."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "GcMAF: Unlicensed HIV drug 'nearly killed patient'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-46308221", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:48", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption David Noakes said 10,000 people had received the product with 99% having no side effects\n\nUp to 75% of patients who reported taking an unlicensed drug marketed as a cure for autism, HIV and cancer, suffered side effects, a court heard.\n\nOne of 17 customers wrote she \"almost died numerous times\" in feedback read at Southwark Crown Court.\n\nThe patients were taking an unlicensed blood product sold by Guernsey-based Immuno Biotech.\n\nFounder David Noakes, of Kent, admitted selling the drug, but maintained \"99%\" of customers suffered no side effects.\n\nNoakes, 65, of Waldershare, Dover, pleaded guilty to charges of manufacturing, supplying and selling the unlicensed medicine and money laundering.

This transition occurred in concert with the development of stone tools, which would have allowed our ancestors to butcher the carcasses of animals; either as scavengers or hunters.\n\nImage copyright Spl Image caption Artwork: The extinct giraffe Sivatherium maurusium vanishes from the fossil record around 700,000 years ago\n\nTo investigate whether humans played a role, the researchers compiled a seven-million-year record of herbivore extinctions in eastern Africa. They focused on the very largest species, the so-called \"megaherbivores\" which weigh more than 2,000lbs (907kg).\n\nToday, only elephants, hippos, giraffes and white and black rhinos fall into this category.\n\nBut the three-million-year-old human relative \"Lucy\" (Australopithecus afarensis) shared her East African habitat with three species of giraffe, two species of rhino, a hippo and four elephant-like species.\n\nAustralia extinction 'due to man'\n\nHuman link to giant turtle's end\n\nThe results of the analysis showed that over the last seven million years, some 28 lineages of large mammal went extinct in Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the onset of the herbivore decline began roughly 4.6 million years ago, and the rate of decline did not change following the appearance of Homo erectus, one of the earliest human ancestors that could have contributed to the extinctions.\n\n\"This extinction process kicks in over a million years before the very earliest evidence for human ancestors making tools or butchering animal carcasses and well before the appearance of any hominin species realistically capable of hunting them, like Homo erectus,\" said Dr Faith.\n\nImage copyright Spl Image caption The fossilised jawbone of a sabre-toothed cat from South Africa. The disappearance of massive herbivores may also have affected the carnivores that fed on them\n\nThe researchers also examined records of climatic and environmental trends. They conclude that the climate is a much more likely culprit than humans. Climate change seems to have been behind the replacement of large shrubs and trees by grasslands.\n\n\"The key factor in the Plio-Pleistocene megaherbivore decline seems to be the expansion of grasslands, which is likely related to a global drop in atmospheric CO\u2082 over the last five million years,\" said co-author John Rowan, from University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n\"Low CO\u2082 levels favour tropical grasses over trees, and as a consequence savannas became less woody and more open through time. We know that many of the extinct megaherbivores fed on woody vegetation, so they seem to disappear alongside their food source.\"\n\nThe loss of big mammals in Africa could also explain other extinctions that have been blamed on our ancient ancestors.\n\nFor example, some scientists have suggested that increasingly carnivorous early human groups led to a decline in predators and scavengers.\n\n\"We know there are also major extinctions among African carnivores at this time and that some of them, like saber-tooth cats, may have specialised on very large prey, perhaps juvenile elephants,\" said co-author Prof Paul Koch from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC).\n\n\"It could be that some of these carnivores disappeared with their megaherbivore prey.\"\n\nWriting in the same issue of Science, Ren\u00e9 Bobe and Susana Carvalho from the University of Oxford raised a few words of caution over the conclusions: \"It is not clear what ecological roles hominins played throughout the long evolutionary history of megaherbivores in Africa, and how these roles changed over time and varied across geographic space.\n\n\"Another question is when hominins became systematic predators of animals larger than themselves.\"\n\nThey added: \"The causes of megaherbivore decline are probably complex, multidimensional, and varied across time and space. The precise timing of key hominin behavioural innovations remains poorly constrained by the current archaeological and palaeontological records.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Warming gas concentrations at new record high", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46289829", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright SerrNovik Image caption Coal fired plants such as this one in Arizona are a significant source of carbon emissions\n\nConcentrations of key gases in the atmosphere that are driving up global temperatures reached a new high in 2017.\n\nIn their annual greenhouse gas bulletin, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says there is no sign of reversal in this rising trend.\n\nCarbon dioxide levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm) in 2017, a level not seen in 3-5 million years.\n\nResearchers also note the resurgence of a banned gas called CFC-11.\n\nWhat are concentrations?\n\nConcentrations differ from emissions in that they represent what remains in the atmosphere after some of the gases are absorbed by the seas, land and trees.\n\nSince 1990 the warming impact of these long lived gases on the climate has increased by 41%.\n\nHow does the latest data compare to previous years?\n\n2017 continues the rise in concentrations of CO2 which are now 46% greater than the levels in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution.\n\nThe increase from 2016 to 2017 was smaller than the rise from 2015 to 2016, but is close to the average growth rate seen over the last decade.\n\nThe scientists at the WMO believe that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere right now hasn't been seen in a long, long time.\n\n\"The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Renewable energy will need to increase rapidly to help the world move away from carbon energy\n\nWhy did CO2 concentrations not rise as fast in 2017?\n\nThat's because of the impact of El Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring weather phenomenon which peaked in 2015 and 2016. This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere.\n\nDoes that lower rise mean that some progress is being made?\n\nNot so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction.\n\n\"I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia.\n\n\"CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!\"\n\nWhat about this mysterious CFC-11 gas?\n\nThere have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation.

Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction.\n\nLevels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade.\n\nNitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels.\n\nWhat are the implications of all these rises?\n\nEssentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success.\n\nThe report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted.\n\n\"CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.\n\n\"There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n\"Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Climate change is likely to increase wildfire impacts\n\nWill this new study have any impact?\n\nThe scientists behind it certainly hope so.

Mission statistics show Mars to be unforgiving to the ill-prepared. Two-thirds of all landing attempts have failed.\n\nThe reason is simple: A probe will enter the atmosphere at six times the speed of a high-velocity bullet and then somehow have to slow to a controlled stop at the surface - all inside seven minutes. An EDL strategy has to be perfect.\n\nThe most recent effort in 2016 - from Europe - got it hopelessly wrong and slammed into the ground.\n\nThe Americans, though, have a pretty good record, and InSight will use the proven combination of a heat-resistant capsule, a parachute and rockets to make its drop to Mars.\n\nJulie Wertz-Chen is part of the InSight EDL team: \"We've done everything we can to try and be successful but it's a really, really difficult thing to do, to land on another planet.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough it is very unusual for a president to personally criticize judges, Trump quickly responded by questioning the independence of federal judges appointed by his predecessor and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' Trump said via Twitter from his Mar-a-lago resort in Florida.\n\nWhile Trump cited the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the ruling that drew his ire came from a district judge in California.\n\n\n\nTrump has been particularly critical of judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and much of the U.S. west coast. Trump tweeted Wednesday the court, considered by many as the country's most liberal, has become a \"terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace.\"\n\n\n\nThe president has maintained the Supreme Court has overruled the 9th Circuit more than other courts, but studies conducted during the past five years show three others have a higher percentage of their rulings overturned.\n\n\n\nThe controversy began Tuesday when Trump attacked U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, who ruled against his migrant asylum order. The ruling prompted Trump to claim again Thursday, as he has in the past, that the 9th Circuit was biased against him.\n\n\n\n\"It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border. It's a disgrace\" he said.\n\n\n\nRoberts had refrained from commenting on Trump's previous attacks on judges. But after a query Wednesday from Associated Press, Roberts defended the independence of the federal judiciary and dismissed the notion that judges are beholden to presidents who appoint them.\n\n\n\nRoberts, who has often expressed concern about attacks on the judiciary's impartiality, has previously been the target of criticism from Trump. Trump often belittled Roberts during the 2016 presidential campaign, at one point calling Roberts an \"absolute disaster\" after Roberts voted along with liberals in 2012 to uphold President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nRoberts was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush and has compiled a firmly conservative voting record during his 13 years on the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe chief justice's statement came as he adjusts to changes on the Supreme Court. The arrival last month of Trump's second appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, pushed Roberts to the court's ideological center, a position that was held by Justice Anthony Kennedy until he retired in July.\n\n\n\nFormer special assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings, told CNN Thursday the ideological shift on the court may have compelled Roberts to defend the courts.\n\n\n\n\"I think what Chief Justice Roberts feels like his job is now is to look out for the integrity of and the reputation of the entire judiciary. I mean in a world where a lot of people view most of government as being polarized, as being partisan for you or partisan against you, I think he believes it's his job to make sure that folks view the judiciary as independent.\"\n\n\n\nInside Elections publisher Nathan Gonzales said on CNN that Trump's criticism of Roberts could further endear him to his conservative base, \"There are some Republicans and conservatives who have already turned their back on Chief Justice Roberts because of his involvement in the decision with the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n\n\nGonzales added, \"We have to remember that the Republican Party has become all about President Trump and whatever he does or the enemies he chooses are going to be with him and I think that remains the case in this situation.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Senate Clash Looming Over Nation's Longest Judicial Vacancy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-clash-looming-over-nation-s-longest-judicial-vacancy/4669533.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Senate Republicans are working to soon fill the nation\u2019s longest judicial vacancy with a North Carolina lawyer whose nomination has raised objections from black lawmakers and civil rights groups concerned about his work defending state laws found to have discriminated against African-Americans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has helped push 84 of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees over the finish line and is itching for more. With just a few more weeks to go before Congress adjourns for the year, he has teed up a vote on the nomination of Thomas Farr, 64, to serve as a district court judge in North Carolina.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Farr\u2019s confirmation with a party-line vote back in January, meaning McConnell has waited about 10 months and until after the midterm elections to hold a vote on the floor.\n\nSenators tend to save their biggest fights in the judicial arena for Supreme Court and appeals court nominees, but Farr\u2019s nomination has proved an exception.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe President Trump nominated him, and it\u2019s even harder to believe the Senate Republicans are considering it again,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York in one of about 20 tweets he has sent out in recent days concerning Farr.\n\nFarr has the backing of home-state Sens. Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, both Republicans. They have noted that Farr was also nominated to the same position by former President George W. Bush and has a \u201cwell qualified\u201d rating from the American Bar Association. They have protested the implication that Farr is racially insensitive or biased.\n\n\u201cI think absolutely destroying a good man\u2019s reputation is inappropriate,\u201d Tillis said before the committee advanced Farr\u2019s nomination.\n\nIn introducing Farr last year, Burr said the judiciary needs good people and he \u201cfills every piece of the word good.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., described Farr as \u201cprobably the worst of the litter\u201d when it comes to Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\n\u201cCould this administration have picked an individual who is more hostile to the rights of minorities than this man? It is hard to imagine,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in the same committee hearing.\n\nGOP leaders in charge of the North Carolina Legislature hired Farr and others at his firm to defend congressional and legislative boundaries that the Legislature approved in 2011. A federal court eventually struck some boundaries down as racial gerrymanders and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision.\n\nFarr also helped defend a 2013 law that required photo identification to vote, reduced the number of early voting days and eliminated same-day registration during that period.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans said that requiring voter ID would increase the integrity of elections. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The Richmond, Virginia-based court said the law targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nFarr told lawmakers that, as an advocate, he vehemently disagreed with the argument that the North Carolina Legislature sought to curtail the voting rights of people of color or any other voter. But, said, \u201cI am obligated to follow the decision by the 4th Circuit and pledge that I will do so.\u201d\n\nThe history of the particular judicial opening Farr would fill has also contributed to the acrimony.\n\nPresident Barack Obama nominated two African-American women to serve on the court, but neither was granted a hearing and their nominations stalled. If confirmed, they would have been the first blacks to serve in that particular district, which is about 27 percent black.\n\nFarr also served as a lawyer for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in 1990. The Justice Department alleged that about 120,000 postcards sent overwhelmingly to black voters before that election was intended to intimidate them from voting.\n\nFarr said he was not consulted about the postcards and did not have any role in drafting or sending them. He said that after he had been asked to review the card, \u201cI was appalled to read the incorrect language printed on the card and to then discover it had been sent to African Americans.\u201d\n\nThe explanation has failed to win over the NAACP.\n\n\u201cThe courts are supposed to be where we can find and seek justice. But Farr\u2019s lifetime crusade is to disenfranchise African Americans and deprive them of their rights,\u201d said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau. \u201cHe belongs nowhere near a bench of justice.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers called on the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, to schedule Farr for another round of testimony about his role in the Helms\u2019 campaign, but Grassley declined.\n\nWith a 51-49 majority, Republicans will have little margin for error in confirming Farr.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has already pledged to oppose all judicial nominees until he gets a vote on legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Migrants in Tijuana Hopeful About Entering US Despite Homeland Security Warnings", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-in-tijuana-hopeful-about-entering-us-despite-homeland-security-warnings/4669043.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has warned Central American migrants seeking political asylum at the U.S. border with Mexico that the Trump administration will not tolerate \"frivolous asylum claims\" or illegal entry.

Easter Island is located some 2,200 miles from the South American continent.\n\nThe campaign to return moai to the island is a part of those efforts.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in the past we did not attach so much importance to Hoa Hakananai\u2019a and his brothers, but nowadays people on the island are starting to realize just how much of our heritage there is around the world and starting to ask why our ancestors are in foreign museums,\u201d Rapanui sculptor Benedicto Tuki told BBC.\n\nTuki volunteered to create an identical moai for the museum should it decide to return the original.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it won\u2019t possess the same ancestral spirit, but it will look identical,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only wish is for him to return home; for me this is worth far more than any amount of money.

According to three separate testimonies obtained by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch, the torture included electric shock, whipping, sleep deprivation tactics and sexual misconduct including forcible kissing, touching and sexual assault.\n\nThe activists showed physical evidence of torture that included red marks on the body, uncontrollable shaking in the hands; some were unable to walk or even stand. One testimony alleged that a woman was hung from the ceiling for a long period of time, and at least one activist attempted suicide multiple times while detained. The activists were also reportedly kept in solitary confinement for at least several months.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported that it was \u201cunclear whether [Saudi officials] were seeking to force the women to sign confessions or merely to punish them for their peaceful advocacy.\u201d\n\nThe reports come just weeks after Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and resident of the U.S., disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. It was later revealed that Khashoggi was tortured, dismembered and beheaded inside.\n\nAny government that tortures women for demanding basic rights should face withering international criticism, not unblinking U.S. and U.K. support. Michael Page, Human Rights Watch deputy Middle East director\n\n\u201cOnly a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities,\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSaudi authorities are directly responsible for the well-being of these women and men in detention,\u201d Maalouf continued. \u201cNot only have they been deprived them of their liberty for months now, simply for peacefully expressing their views, they are also subjecting them to horrendous physical suffering.\u201d\n\nMichael Page, the deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, also responded to the allegations of torture in a Wednesday statement.\n\n\u201cAny government that tortures women for demanding basic rights should face withering international criticism, not unblinking U.S. and U.K. support,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has faced continuing criticism for doing little in response to the Khashoggi murder, despite a CIA conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the death of the journalist. Trump has instead stressed the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, as well as the economic benefits of Saudi purchases of U.S. weapons.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance has prompted a barrage of bipartisan criticism. Sen Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), of late a staunch Trump supporter, said Tuesday \u201cit is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder\u201d of Khashoggi.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote on Twitter that \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince, the country\u2019s youngest ruler in modern history at 33 years old, has pushed modernizing the country by lifting the ban on female drivers, launching economic reforms and re-opening movie theaters for the first time in decades. Just weeks before lifting the driving ban, however, the crown prince cracked down on women\u2019s activists and other peaceful protesters \u2015 a move many critics say was a power-hungry attempt to show that progressive change can only come from the government."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Child Bride Auctioned Off On Facebook, Which Didn't Notice The Sale", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-bride-auction-facebook_us_5bf433c8e4b0d9e7283d89a9", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "A teenage girl in South Sudan was recently auctioned off as a child bride on Facebook, according to a children\u2019s rights organization that suggested the social media giant was serving as a modern-day slave market.\n\nThe post about the auction was immediately taken down after its discovery on Nov. 9, a Facebook spokesperson told HuffPost on Tuesday, but CNN said that was 15 days after the auction began and several days after the girl was married.\n\nThe sale of the girl earned her father 500 cows, three cars and $10,000, according to Plan International.

He\u2019s been avoiding them since the mid-\u201960s,\u201d said Will Fischer, an Iraq War veteran with the liberal group VoteVets, referring to Trump\u2019s avoidance of service during the Vietnam War.\n\nTrump sat in a chandeliered room with gold ceilings and read from a script before conversing with several of them on issues ranging from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to whether the United States was getting \u201cripped off\u201d on trade agreements.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any issues in terms of trade right now,\u201d a Coast Guard commander stationed in Bahrain said, sounding somewhat puzzled.\n\nAs he did on Tuesday while leaving the White House for his Thanksgiving vacation, Trump hinted that he might visit troops in a forward combat zone. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some interesting things. We\u2019ll be doing some very interesting things,\u201d he told reporters invited by the White House to watch Trump\u2019s teleconference from his members-only Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe added that he knew when he would be going but would not say. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re the last people I can tell,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nWhether Trump ever visits any troops overseas, though, is far from guaranteed. Trump has made numerous promises that he has failed to honor.\n\nHe pledged that he would release his tax returns if he ran for president, for instance, but has refused to do so since he announced his campaign three years ago. He promised hundreds of times during his campaign that he would build a wall along the southwestern border and force Mexico to pay for it, but in his first two years, has not broached the topic a single time with the Mexican president\u2019s office.\n\nFurther, Trump has long been clear about his deep concern for his personal safety. During his 2015 visit to the Conservative Political Action Conference in a suburb of Washington, D.C., he was accompanied by at least a half dozen private bodyguards, back when he was merely a reality television host and golf course developer. Other speakers, including sitting senators and governors, traveled with either no security at all or one or two state police agents.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, upon seeing news of a suicide bombing in Iraq on television, Trump was asked to name the most dangerous place he has ever visited. After joking \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d he replied that the United States had extremely unsafe places of its own.\n\n\u201cThere are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously,\u201d he told The New York Times.\n\nAnd The Washington Post reported this week that Trump does not want to visit combat zones because he fears for his life.\n\nThe White House on Thursday did not respond to a query about that report. But those fears, if true, appear consistent with Trump\u2019s history. While he has claimed to be pro-military for decades, he avoided service in Vietnam using a string of education deferments and then claimed a medical exemption because of bone spurs in his heels.\n\nHe later described that period as a difficult time because of the danger of contracting sexually transmitted diseases from the women he was sleeping with. \u201cIt is my personal Vietnam,\u201d he told radio host Howard Stern in 1997. \u201cI feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump has made a habit of attacking military veterans and families when they have criticized him.\n\nHe insulted former POW and Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying that he preferred those who had not been captured. Trump insulted Gold Star parents whose Muslim son was killed in 2004 in Iraq while saving those under his command. And just this week, Trump falsely stated that retired Adm. Bill McRaven, the decorated Navy SEAL whose team killed Sept. 11 terrorist Osama bin Laden, was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Trump then criticized McRaven for not having gotten bin Laden sooner.\n\nTrump has made but a single visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet the returning remains of fallen service members, very early in his presidency, and has refused to attend another one after a parent of a killed Special Forces member berated him at the arrival ceremony.\n\nTwo major accomplishments he boasts of \u2014 providing record-high budgets for the military and passing a law to let veterans see local private doctors \u2014 are false.\n\nPresident Barack Obama approved a $721 billion defense budget in 2010 and one for $717 billion in 2011. Both were higher than the $716 billion budget Trump repeatedly brags about for this year \u2014 even before adjusting for inflation.

He also has not visited those troops, even though they remain separated from their families over the Thanksgiving holidays because of what critics have called a political stunt.\n\nAnd after the elections, he skipped a visit to an American cemetery in France commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I because of rain and fog. Two days later, back in Washington on the observed Veterans Day holiday, he chose not to visit Arlington National Cemetery and remained at the White House tweeting instead.\n\nWrapping up his session with reporters Thursday morning, Trump said that he was thankful for how successful he has been as president. \u201cI made a tremendous difference in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office, and you wouldn\u2019t believe it, and when you see it, we\u2019ve gotten so much stronger, people don\u2019t even believe it.\u201d\n\nTrump followed his teleconference with overseas service members Thursday morning with a brief visit to the Coast Guard station at nearby Lake Worth Inlet before heading to his private, for-profit golf course in West Palm Beach.

Instead, their symptoms were similar to those that had previously been associated with hysterical women \u2013 most commonly amnesia, or some kind of paralysis or inability to communicate with no clear physical cause.\n\nEnglish physician Charles Myers, who wrote the first paper on \u201cshell-shock\u201d in 1915, theorized that these symptoms actually did stem from a physical injury. He posited that repetitive exposure to concussive blasts caused brain trauma that resulted in this strange grouping of symptoms. But once put to the test, his hypothesis didn\u2019t hold up. There were plenty of veterans who had not been exposed to the concussive blasts of trench warfare, for example, who were still experiencing the symptoms of shell-shock. (And certainly not all veterans who had seen this kind of battle returned with symptoms.)\n\nWe now know that what these combat veterans were facing was likely what today we call post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. We are now better able to recognize it, and treatments have certainly advanced, but we still don\u2019t have a full understanding of just what PTSD is.\n\nThe medical community and society at large are accustomed to looking for the most simple cause and cure for any given ailment. This results in a system where symptoms are discovered and cataloged and then matched with therapies that will alleviate them. Though this method works in many cases, for the past 100 years, PTSD has been resisting.\n\nWe are three scholars in the humanities who have individually studied PTSD \u2013 the framework through which people conceptualize it, the ways researchers investigate it, the therapies the medical community devises for it. Through our research, each of us has seen how the medical model alone fails to adequately account for the ever-changing nature of PTSD.\n\nWhat\u2019s been missing is a cohesive explanation of trauma that allows us to explain the various ways its symptoms have manifested over time and can differ in different people.\n\nNonphysical repercussions of the Great War\n\nOnce it became clear that not everyone who suffered from shell-shock in the wake of WWI had experienced brain injuries, the British Medical Journal provided alternate nonphysical explanations for its prevalence.\n\nA poor morale and a defective training are one of the most important, if not the most important etiological factors: also that shell-shock was a \u201ccatching\u201d complaint. \u2013 (The British Medical Journal, 1922)\n\nShell-shock went from being considered a legitimate physical injury to being a sign of weakness, of both the battalion and the soldiers within it. One historian estimates at least 20 percent of men developed shell-shock, though the figures are murky due to physician reluctance at the time to brand veterans with a psychological diagnosis that could affect disability compensation.\n\nSoldiers were archetypically heroic and strong. When they came home unable to speak, walk or remember, with no physical reason for those shortcomings, the only possible explanation was personal weakness. Treatment methods were based on the idea that the soldier who had entered into war as a hero was now behaving as a coward and needed to be snapped out of it.\n\nLewis Yealland, a British clinician, described in his 1918 \u201cHysterical Disorders of Warfare\u201d the kind of brutal treatment that follows from thinking about shell-shock as a personal failure. After nine months of unsuccessfully treating patient A1, including electric shocks to the neck, cigarettes put out on his tongue and hot plates placed at the back of his throat, Yealland boasted of telling the patient, \u201cYou will not leave this room until you are talking as well as you ever did; no, not before\u2026 you must behave as the hero I expect you to be.\u201d\n\nYealland then applied an electric shock to the throat so strong that it sent the patient reeling backwards, unhooking the battery from the machine. Undeterred, Yealland strapped the patient down to avoid the battery problem and continued to apply shock for an hour, at which point patient A1 finally whispered \u201cAh.\u201d After another hour, the patient began to cry and whispered, \u201cI want a drink of water.\u201d\n\nYealland reported this encounter triumphantly \u2013 the breakthrough meant his theory was correct and his method worked. Shell-shock was a disease of manhood rather than an illness that came from witnessing, being subjected to and partaking in incredible violence.\n\nEvolution away from shell-shock\n\nThe next wave of the study of trauma came when the Second World War saw another influx of soldiers dealing with similar symptoms.\n\nIt was Abram Kardiner, a clinician working in the psychiatric clinic of the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau, who rethought combat trauma in a much more empathetic light. In his influential book, \u201cThe Traumatic Neuroses of War,\u201d Kardiner speculated that these symptoms stemmed from psychological injury, rather than a soldier\u2019s flawed character.\n\nWork from other clinicians after WWII and the Korean War suggested that post-war symptoms could be lasting. Longitudinal studies showed that symptoms could persist anywhere from six to 20 years, if they disappeared at all. These studies returned some legitimacy to the concept of combat trauma that had been stripped away after the First World War.\n\nAs veterans returned home from the war in Vietnam, combat trauma became less stigmatized. manhhai, CC BY\n\nVietnam was another watershed moment for combat-related PTSD because veterans began to advocate for themselves in an unprecedented way. Beginning with a small march in New York in the summer of 1967, veterans themselves began to become activists for their own mental health care. They worked to redefine \u201cpost-Vietnam syndrome\u201d not as a sign of weakness, but rather a normal response to the experience of atrocity. Public understanding of war itself had begun to shift, too, as the widely televised accounts of the My Lai massacre brought the horror of war into American living rooms for the first time. The veterans\u2019 campaign helped get PTSD included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-III), the major American diagnostic resource for psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians.\n\nThe authors of the DSM-III deliberately avoided talking about the causes of mental disorders. Their aim was to develop a manual that could simultaneously be used by psychiatrists adhering to radically different theories, including Freudian approaches and what is now known as \u201cbiological psychiatry.\u201d These groups of psychiatrists would not agree on how to explain disorders, but they could \u2013 and did \u2013 come to agree on which patients had similar symptoms. So the DSM-III defined disorders, including PTSD, solely on the basis of clusters of symptoms, an approach that has been retained ever since.\n\nThis tendency to agnosticism about the physiology of PTSD is also reflected in contemporary evidence-based approaches to medicine. Modern medicine focuses on using clinical trials to demonstrate that a therapy works, but is skeptical about attempts to link treatment effectiveness to the biology underlying a disease.\n\nToday\u2019s medicalized PTSD\n\nPeople can develop PTSD for a number of different reasons, not just in combat. Sexual assault, a traumatic loss, a terrible accident \u2013 each might lead to PTSD. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates about 13.8 percent of the veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan currently have PTSD. For comparison, a male veteran of those wars is four times more likely to develop PTSD than a man in the civilian population is. PTSD is probably at least partially at the root of an even more alarming statistic: Upwards of 22 veterans commit suicide every day.\n\nTherapies for PTSD today tend to be a mixed bag. Practically speaking, when veterans seek PTSD treatment in the VA system, policy requires they be offered either exposure or cognitive therapy. Exposure therapies are based on the idea that the fear response that gives rise to many of the traumatic symptoms can be dampened through repeated exposures to the traumatic event. Cognitive therapies work on developing personal coping methods and slowly changing unhelpful or destructive thought patterns that are contributing to symptoms (for example, the shame one might feel at not successfully completing a mission or saving a comrade). The most common treatment a veteran will likely receive will include psychopharmaceuticals \u2013 especially the class of drugs called SSRIs.\n\nMindfulness therapies, based on becoming aware of mental states, thoughts and feelings and accepting them rather than trying to fight them or push them away, are another option. There are also more alternative methods being studied such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or EMDR therapy, therapies using controlled doses of MDMA (Ecstasy), virtual reality-graded exposure therapy, hypnosis and creative therapies. The military funds a wealth of research on new technologies to address PTSD; these include neurotechnological innovations like transcranial stimulation and neural chips as well as novel drugs.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that patients improve most when they\u2019ve chosen their own therapy. But even if they narrow their choices to the ones backed by the weight of the National Center for PTSD by using the center\u2019s online Treatment Decision Aid, patients would still find themselves weighing five options, each of which is evidence-based but entails a different psychomedical model of trauma and healing.\n\nThis buffet of treatment options lets us set aside our lack of understanding of why people experience trauma and respond to interventions so differently. It also relieves the pressure for psychomedicine to develop a complete model of PTSD. We reframe the problem as a consumer issue instead of a scientific one.\n\nThus, while WWI was about soldiers and punishing them for their weakness, in the contemporary era, the ideal veteran PTSD patient is a health care consumer who has an obligation to play an active role in figuring out and optimizing his own therapy.\n\nAs we stand here with the strange benefit of the hindsight that comes with 100 years of studying combat-related trauma, we must be careful in celebrating our progress. What is still missing is an explanation of why people have different responses to trauma, and why different responses occur in different historical periods. For instance, the paralysis and amnesia that epitomized WWI shell-shock cases are now so rare that they don\u2019t even appear as symptoms in the DSM entry for PTSD. We still don\u2019t know enough about how soldiers\u2019 own experiences and understandings of PTSD are shaped by the broader social and cultural views of trauma, war and gender. Though we have made incredible strides in the century since World War I, PTSD remains a chameleon, and demands our continued study."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Admits To Targeting Billionaire George Soros In PR Attack", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-target-george-soros-billionaire_us_5bf5d6f2e4b0771fb6b5b1ec", "accessed_time": "2018-11-23 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook officials on Wednesday admitted to digging up dirt on Jewish billionaire George Soros and its competitors less than a week after The New York Times published an explosive expos\u00e9 on the tech giant.\n\nElliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s head of communication and policy, published a blog post detailing the company\u2019s decision to hire Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, and why it aimed its effort at the company\u2019s critics, including Soros.\n\n\u201cSome of this work is being characterized as opposition research,\u201d Schrage wrote. \u201cBut I believe it would be irresponsible and unprofessional for us not to understand the backgrounds and potential conflicts of interest of our critics.\u201d\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied having any knowledge of the company\u2019s PR campaign against Soros until the Times investigation, which also found negative campaigns aimed at Apple and Google, was made public.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, also denied having knowledge of the hiring of Definers.
