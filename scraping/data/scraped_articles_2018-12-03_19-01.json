Bush can perform one last, posthumous service to his country this week by orchestrating a rare moment of unity and a short-term truce in the rancorous politics swirling around the crisis-stricken Trump presidency.\n\nThe remains of the former president, who died at home in Texas on Friday night at 94, will be brought to Washington on Monday to allow the nation to bid farewell to a man whose one-term presidency looks better with each year that passes.\n\nThe ex-commander-in-chief will lie in state at the US Capitol ahead of a state funeral service in Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday that will see a meeting of the world's most exclusive club \u2014 that of former presidents.\n\nFor a few days, a building showdown over a possible partial government shutdown may ease, and the increasing threat posed to the Trump presidency by special counsel Robert Mueller could fade into the background.\n\nDespite antipathy between the Bush family and President Donald Trump, the 41st president made clear he wanted America's current leader to be at the funeral, putting the institution of the presidency above personal animosities.\n\nTrump has confirmed he will attend the event, which follows a series of national disasters and tragedies and moments of public mourning that have caused critics to fault his behavior as short of that expected of a president.\n\nTo his credit, Trump canceled what was certain to be a contentious news conference at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday out of respect for Bush. He also sent one of the iconic blue-and-white 747 jets that serves as Air Force One when a president is aboard to Texas to carry Bush's casket.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina in a gracious tribute.\n\n\"So we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's ceremony still promises to be an awkward moment of political theater for Trump, since he will come face-to-face with former presidents and other top officials whom he has attacked in recent days.\n\nJust last week for instance, Trump retweeted an image that pictures former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, behind bars. Trump often beams at rallies as his crowds chant \"lock her up!\" about the former Democratic nominee. And Michelle Obama wrote in her new autobiography that she will \"never forgive\" Trump for his conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace that launched the real estate mogul and reality TV star's political career.\n\nTrump is likely to come face to face with all four in the National Cathedral before a huge television audience. The encounter will highlight how several of the former leaders, including Obama and Clinton, forged close relationships with their Republican predecessor as well as the friendly relations between them and Bush's son, former President George W. Bush. No such ties exist between that trio and the current President, who often criticizes his predecessors and has given no sign of taking advantage of their advice and experience of doing one of the toughest and loneliest jobs in global politics.\n\nThe President also belittled another of the elder Bush's sons, former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, during the 2016 campaign, and in July, mocked a signature quote by the 41st president about a \"thousand points of light,\" which was later used as the name of his charity.\n\nUnavoidable comparisons\n\nWednesday's state funeral will offer similarities and contrasts to the final farewell for John McCain in September, to which Trump was not invited after mocking the Arizona senator during the 2016 campaign for being shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam nearly 50 years before.\n\nSuch analogies are likely to be perceived again in the tributes to Bush, who was almost universally regarded as a gentleman and a throwback to a more civil and magnanimous era of politics.\n\nStill, with Trump attending, and if he desists from his trademark inflammatory politics, the nation's divides could be papered over, at least for a few days.\n\nBush's passing also looks set to postpone one of the final political showdowns of the year \u2014 a funding controversy entangled in Trump's demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall.\n\nA source briefed on the talks told CNN that lawmakers are considering taking up a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown by a Friday deadline, since Congress will be out of session at the beginning of the week ahead of Bush's ceremonies.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would be open to such a solution.\n\n\"I would absolutely consider it and probably give it,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia cloud darkens over Trump\n\nWashington's period of mourning come at a fraught moment in Trump's presidency, after a week in which it became clear that Mueller is narrowing in on the President as his investigation gathers pace.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller unveiled a cooperation agreement with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen admitted to lying to Congress to cover up the fact that he was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow right up until June 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nHe had previously said talks about the Moscow project ended in January 2016 and said he lied out of a sense of obligation to Trump.\n\nA pair of developments on Friday night appeared to bring the probe even closer to the White House. CNN reported that Cohen believed that Trump would offer him a pardon in exchange for staying on message in in talks with federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump never indicated any such possibility to Cohen. But the report immediately sparked speculation about communications between the two men. Any proof that Trump had offered a pardon in return for Cohen's testimony would be an abuse of power and possibly an impeachable offense.\n\nThen, in a filing later on Friday, Cohen's lawyers offered the clearest sign yet that he kept Trump informed of his efforts to close the deal in Moscow in 2016.\n\nA political hiatus over the next few days might give Trump some brief relief from Russia questions but could also complicate his effort to celebrate an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stave off an escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn exchange, China will buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance, according to a White House statement."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "George H.W.

Bush will be eulogized by his son, former President George W. Bush, along with a mix of family and friends on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral, the most high-profile event in a week of proceedings that will remember the remarkable life of the president who died on Friday at 94.\n\nAlong with his son, George H.W. Bush will be eulogized by former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose time in power overlapped with Bush, former US Sen. Alan Simpson, who became a close friend to Bush, and presidential historian Jon Meacham, the late president's biographer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will not speak at the funeral, sources with knowledge of the plans tell CNN, but has said that he will attend Wednesday's memorial. Despite the fact that Trump's rise to power included lambasting past presidents, including both Bushes, the President has responded to Bush's death with repeated laudatory comments.\n\nThe plans for Bush's funeral were all put into place before Trump was ever elected, sources tell CNN. Presidents are traditionally asked to eulogize presidents who have died -- and in past state events like this, that has been the case -- but the Bush family is unlike any other and has another president in the family who will fill that role.\n\nTrump will pay a condolence call to the Bush family on Tuesday at Blair House, according to the sources, a government house across the street from the White House.\n\nAs of Monday morning, all living Presidents are expected to attend Bush's funeral on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nPresidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are all expected to attend the service, according to sources familiar with the planning of the funeral. The current and all former first ladies are also expected to attend, except for Rosalynn Carter, according to the sources.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will also attend the funeral, an aide to Biden confirms.\n\nBush's passing has led to an outpouring of remembrances for the humble and gentlemanly statesman, whose life and service was seen to stand in direct contrast to the vitriol and partisanship that has enveloped elected politics in recent years. Many have also heralded Bush's 73-year marriage to his wife, Barbara Bush, who died months before her husband in April 2018.\n\nThose reflections will continue throughout the week, when Bush's casket travels from Houston, Bush's hometown, to Washington, DC to lie in state in the United States Capitol. Trump directed the presidential plane -- called Air Force One when the sitting President is aboard -- to pick up Bush's casket and transport it to Washington.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina where he was attending the G20 summit. \"So, we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBush will lie in state until Wednesday morning when his casket will then be transported to the National Cathedral for the first of two funeral services for the former president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence will offer brief remarks Monday at the evening ceremony at the Capitol before the public can visit the president lying in state. It is anticipated that foreign leaders will also be paying condolence calls to the family on Tuesday.\n\nThe German government press service announced Monday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will fly to Washington, DC, to take part in the memorial service for the late president, who oversaw the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany.\n\nOn Thursday, Bush's casket will travel back to Houston, where he will be memorialized at St. Martin's Episcopal Church and eulogized by his grandson, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, and former Secretary of State James Baker, a man who has been by Bush's side since the former president's failed 1970 Senate campaign in Texas.\n\nMembers of the family, including children and grandchildren, will be taking part in each service.\n\nBush's personal relationship with his Secret Service details will also be on full display throughout the week of events. The detail, made up of agents who enjoyed a close relationship with the former President, will be with him until he is interred and in the second vehicle in the motorcades that will lead to all the ceremonies.\n\nSome of the agents will also act as honorary pallbearers in Texas at the funeral home and Ellington Field, where Bush will begin his final flight back to Washington, DC.\n\nThe honorary pallbearers in Washington -- for both Bush's entry into the Rotunda and the National Cathedral -- will be Navy captains and admirals who have commanded the USS George H.W. Bush and members of the carrier strike group.\n\nBush's death has also led to a series of symbolic moments.\n\nBush had come to be known in recent years for his colorful and symbolic use of socks, wearing different pairs to express his mood or mark occasions. Jim McGrath, Bush's spokesman, tweeted on Monday that the 41st President \"will be carried to his final rest wearing socks that pay tribute to his lifetime of service, starting as an 18 year-old naval aviator in war.\"\n\nMcGrath also tweeted a photo of Sully, Bush's service dog, laying in front of the late President's casket on Sunday night with the caption, \"Mission Complete.\"\n\nSully is named after former airline pilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger III, who became famous for landing a damaged passenger jet on the Hudson River and saving all 155 passengers and crew in 2009.\n\nFollowing the week of services, Bush will be laid to rest on his presidential library grounds at Texas A&M University, where his wife and Robin, his daughter who died of leukemia in 1953, are buried."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Bush family reunited in cartoonist's touching tribute", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/qruqzn3tUdA/marshall-ramsey-george-bush-tribute-cartoon-sot-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

In private, the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back.\n\nIn more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a \"beast,\" a \"pac-man\" who would devour all in his path, even his supporters.\n\nCNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince.\n\n\"The more victims he eats, the more he wants,\" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up . \"I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.\"\n\nThis is what logic says, but I no longer have faith in it to analyze the man's mind.\n\nIs there a possibility that when he becomes a King he would pardon them\n\nArrests are unjustified and do not serve him (logic says), but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast \"pac man\" the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows\n\nThe exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. \"[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,\" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.\n\nBut in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. \"God help us,\" he wrote.\n\nTwo months later, he was dead.\n\nAbdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone.\n\n\"The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,\" Abdelaziz told CNN. \"The guilt is killing me.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz believes Saudi authorities intercepted private messages between him and Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSIM cards and financial support\n\nAbdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.\n\nIn almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340,000-strong Twitter following.\n\nThe digital offensive, dubbed the \"cyber bees,\" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. \"We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,\" said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi government's strongest weapon. \"Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked, we've been insulted, we'd been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.\"\n\nThe pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial $30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.\n\nIn one exchange, dated May this year, Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. \"I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.\"\n\n\"Brilliant report,\" Khashoggi replies. \"I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz I sent you a brief idea about the work of the electronic army\n\nJamal Khashoggi Brilliant report. I will try to sort out the money. we have to do something.\n\nYou know, sometimes I get affected by their attacks and hate tweeting.\n\nA month later, another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first $5,000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up.\n\nBut in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi.\n\n\"How did they know?\" asks Khashoggi in a message.\n\n\"There must have been a gap,\" says Abdulaziz.\n\nThree minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: \"God help us.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Once they heard about the bees, they were really worried and disturbed, the officials. They arrested a lot people and raided many places. I bore the brunt of having the group and communication. I'm glad you're abroad and you are safe.\n\nJamal Khashoggi How did they know about the bees?\n\nThe family's safety\n\nOmar Alzahrani I began to create groups\n\nI began to do some work and surely there must have been a gap\n\nTens of people must have been involved in this.\n\nCan you imagine my brother was telling me, Omar don't tweet about Canada and about the bees.\n\n!\n\nOtherwise I will go to prison\n\nJamal Khashoggi God help us.\n\nOmar Alzahrani Those who ride the sea shouldn't fear of drowning.\n\nJamal Khashoggi May god protect you, you are in Canada which is the sanctuary for the aggrieved people. May god protect you from any Qaddafis or Qaddafi stupidity (Qaddafi as an adjective)\n\nDo not discuss the subject of bees even in Instagram.\n\nThe 'hack'\n\nAbdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware.\n\nAccording to Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group, and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nMarczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia.\n\nDanna Ingleton, an Amnesty deputy program director, said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license, Ingleton said.\n\nOn Sunday, Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv, alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes, knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. \"NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,\" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who is acting for Abdulaziz.\n\nThe lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Monday, after the lawsuit was filed, NSO Group said it was \"completely unfounded\" and \"shows no evidence that the company's technology was used\" to hack Abdulaziz's phone. NSO also said its technology helps governments and law enforcement agencies \"fight terrorism and crime in a modern age\" and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government.\n\nThe statement added: \"The lawsuit appears to be based on a collection of press clippings that have been generated for the sole purpose of creating news headlines and do not reflect the reality of NSO's work.\"\n\n\"In addition, products supplied by NSO are operated by the government customer to whom they were supplied, without the involvement of NSO or its employees.\"\n\nJamal Khashoggi is remembered at a memorial in Washington.\n\n'Tyranny has no logic'\n\nThe fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.\n\nThe messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power.\n\n\"He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,\" Khashoggi says of bin Salman, \"but tyranny has no logic.\"\n\nSuch discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile, they flitted back and forth between phone calls, voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal.\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Just wishing you happy health, a greeting and every good thing\n\nJamal Khashoggi I hope you are well Omar. May God listens to you and rid us and the nation from this predicament.\n\nAs Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future, Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top.\n\n'Message from MBS'\n\nLast May, Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN.\n\nSpeaking in Arabic, the men, referred to only as Abdullah and Malek, tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself, bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed, they say, and wants to offer him a job.\n\n\"We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you,\" one of them says.\n\nAbdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death, blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt, masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh.\n\nChillingly, the men mention also Saud al Qathani, bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"If Saud al Qathani himself hears your name, he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly,\" says one other man.\n\nThen they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork.\n\nPoignantly, Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life.\n\n\"He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places.\"\n\nOn October 2, Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Spain's Vox party wins seats as far-right party surges for first time since Franco", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/lplj_LPDwks/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Madrid (CNN) A far-right party in Spain broke new political ground Sunday after winning 12 seats in a regional election for the first time since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.\n\nIn another sign that the far-right is gaining momentum in Europe, the Vox party gained its success in Andalucia, an area in the south of the country which has suffered with high unemployment and is one of the flashpoints for the country's battle with illegal immigration.\n\nIts success was lauded by French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, who tweeted : \"Strong and warm congratulations to my friends from Vox, who tonight in Spain scored a meaningful result for such a young and dynamic movement.\"\n\nVox has attracted voters with its hard line stance on illegal immigration, its opposition to Catalan independence and its calls for Gibraltar to be returned to Spain.\n\nIt could now find itself in a position as kingmaker with the ruling Socialist party failing to secure enough seats to command a majority.\n\nVox candidate for Andalusian regional Presidency, magistrate Francisco Serrano (C), reacts during an election night party in Seville/.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Qatar is pulling out of OPEC", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/30PQPFFtQ2g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Dubai (CNN Business) OPEC is losing one of its oldest members.\n\nThe small, gas-rich state of Qatar said Monday that it will leave the oil cartel on January 1 after nearly 60 years.

The government argues Cox's briefing will be sufficient, but Starmer said \"if they don't produce it tomorrow then we will start contempt proceedings, and this will be a collision course between the government and Parliament.\"\n\n\"I accept that it's exceptional to have that disclosed. It has happened in the past, but it is exceptional,\" he added. \"That's why we had a debate in parliament, to say: is this the sort of case where it's so exceptional that it should be disclosed?\"\n\nJUST WATCHED E.U. Leaders back Brexit deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH E.U. Leaders back Brexit deal 08:07\n\nThis will put May in a difficult position as she attempts to lobby Conservative Party votes for her bill, while potentially having to reveal compromises over the so-called Northern Ireland \"backstop\" position which could doom it in the eyes of pro-Brexit MPs.\n\nThe backstop is designed to prevent a hard border between EU member the Republic of Ireland, and Brexiting Northern Ireland -- which many fear could lead to a return to violence in the region. Under the agreement reached with Brussels , failure to reach an alternate deal defaults to a backstop in the form of a \"single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nSuch a situation would essentially leave the UK both in and out of the EU, in line with all EU regulations and rules but unable to influence them. It would also block the most ambitious post-Brexit policies of hardliners in May's Party, many of whom see such a deal as anathema to the 2016 vote on leaving the EU.\n\nAs if the Northern Ireland issue wasn't bad enough for May's chances, the government was also forced to admit last week that the deal will be bad for the UK's economy . According to assessments by Downing Street and the Bank of England, under any scenario, leaving the European Union will make Britain poorer than staying in.\n\nIn the increasingly likely event therefore that May loses next week's vote, Labour will almost certainly seize on it as an opportunity to bring down her government -- which is currently propped up by an unsteady alliance with the right-wing Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), that is itself expected to vote against the deal.\n\n\"Obviously, it'll depend on what actually happens in nine days. It depends on what the response is. But if she's lost a vote of this significance after two years of negotiation, then it is right that there should be a general election because, but for the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the convention was always, if a government loses what's called a confidence vote -- something of such significance -- then that government has to go,\" Starmer said.\n\nJUST WATCHED UK, Spain reach an agreement over Gibraltar Replay More Videos ...

US oil prices, boosted by hopes of an agreement by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut output, surged 4%.\n\nAfter meeting on Saturday, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold their fire on tariffs while they try to reach a trade deal. Trump agreed not to raise the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for now. Those tariffs had been scheduled to automatically rise to 25% on January 1. And China said it would be willing to purchase a \"very substantial\" amount of agriculture, energy and other US products.\n\nStill, some analysts warned that the celebration on Wall Street could be short-lived.

But economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 because of the fading impact of the tax cuts, the impact of existing tariffs and higher borrowing costs.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Much has been written this year about women's anger -- its power and potential, its evolution and necessity. But beneath the analysis, there is the feeling itself: anger, pure and simple. It's what I felt when I read CNN's report about the destruction -- the outrageous, careless, wrongheaded, uneducated, ill-informed, dangerous, willful destruction -- of rape kits.\n\nI have been engaged in the work to bring an end to sexual violence since 2004, the year I started the Joyful Heart Foundation, which aims to heal and empower sexual assault survivors. But in truth, my work goes back even further -- to the moment I learned some of the statistics about sexual assault and domestic violence in preparation for my role on \"Law & Order: SVU.\"\n\nFor example, in the United States, one in three women and one in six men are survivors of sexual violence . One in four women and one in seven men have suffered severe violence from an intimate partner . Those numbers alone almost made my head explode.\n\nI had that feeling again when I first learned about the backlog of untested rape kits in 2009, after a report from Human Rights Watch . I couldn't wrap my mind around it: thousands of rape kits sitting, in some cases rotting, in police storage facilities across the country.\n\nAs Polly Poskin, executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, has said, \"If you've got stacks of physical evidence of a crime, and you're not doing everything you can with the evidence, then you must be making a decision that this isn't a very serious crime.\" Beyond the obvious threat to public safety, beyond the wasted opportunities to both prosecute the guilty and exonerate the wrongly convicted, the backlog sends a devastating and inexcusable message to survivors: You don't matter. What happened to you doesn't matter.\n\nAnd if the backlog wasn't enough, the destruction of rape kits now brings our country's attitude toward sexual assault and its victims into even sharper focus. Explore CNN's investigative report and you will learn about 99 agencies in 47 states destroying rape kits. About a detective in North Carolina who authorized the trashing of a rape kit a month after it was collected from a woman who was gang raped because the investigator didn't believe her. And about records showing kits were trashed as recently as 2016 -- with one of the objectives being to \"make space in the evidence room.\"\n\nThat is an outrageous, shameful level of disregard, and the system that makes it possible must change. Just as the backlog is a reflection of how we regard sexual assault and its victims in this country, the individual actions and decisions by law enforcement are the outcome of deeply entrenched societal attitudes that make those actions and decisions possible. Those attitudes must be dismantled.\n\nAnd what must change are the laws governing the handling of rape kits.\n\nAs CNN reports, last year the National Institute of Justice issued recommendations for best practices about the counting, tracking and testing of rape kits, reforms that the federal government agrees are needed. In order to be able to hold jurisdictions accountable, those recommendations must become law in all 50 states. Legally requiring the testing of rape kits and prohibiting the destruction of rape kits ensures that every survivor gets the same standard of care and rights. Importantly, each survivor should also have the right -- by law -- to know the status of their rape kit and have the option of having it preserved for as long as they want.\n\nIt is important to note that systemic and lasting change takes effect through state-level legislation. While agency, local, and county-level reforms are vital, we know that perpetrators do not stop at the county limits, and survivors' access to justice should not be restricted by zip code.\n\nProgress has already been made, to be sure. In the last two years alone, we and our partners have helped pass 34 laws to change the way rape kits are handled and are already working on legislation for 2019. Through endthebacklog.org , the first and only comprehensive online hub for information about the rape kit backlog in the United States, we are sharing best practices, progress on reform and a way for people to join this growing effort.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI also had the great privilege of telling survivors' stories who have kits in the backlog in \"I Am Evidence,\" the documentary I produced in partnership with HBO, which continues to be shown in communities across the country.\n\nIn the work to bring this violence to an end -- that is the vision to which we must commit -- stark reminders, like this important report from CNN, confront us with how much work is left to be done. While the report's content angers me deeply, perhaps that anger is not pure and simple. It also contains a renewed resolve, a reminder of how much is at stake in our work, and a deepened determination to create the more just society we all seek."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "See moment in courthouse when earthquake hits", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/0uK_Blw22fE/alaska-earthquake-hide-in-courthouse-nr-vpx.ktva", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Bush can perform one last, posthumous service to his country this week by orchestrating a rare moment of unity and a short-term truce in the rancorous politics swirling around the crisis-stricken Trump presidency.\n\nThe remains of the former president, who died at home in Texas on Friday night at 94, will be brought to Washington on Monday to allow the nation to bid farewell to a man whose one-term presidency looks better with each year that passes.\n\nThe ex-commander-in-chief will lie in state at the US Capitol ahead of a state funeral service in Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday that will see a meeting of the world's most exclusive club \u2014 that of former presidents.\n\nFor a few days, a building showdown over a possible partial government shutdown may ease, and the increasing threat posed to the Trump presidency by special counsel Robert Mueller could fade into the background.\n\nDespite antipathy between the Bush family and President Donald Trump, the 41st president made clear he wanted America's current leader to be at the funeral, putting the institution of the presidency above personal animosities.\n\nTrump has confirmed he will attend the event, which follows a series of national disasters and tragedies and moments of public mourning that have caused critics to fault his behavior as short of that expected of a president.\n\nTo his credit, Trump canceled what was certain to be a contentious news conference at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday out of respect for Bush. He also sent one of the iconic blue-and-white 747 jets that serves as Air Force One when a president is aboard to Texas to carry Bush's casket.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina in a gracious tribute.\n\n\"So we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's ceremony still promises to be an awkward moment of political theater for Trump, since he will come face-to-face with former presidents and other top officials whom he has attacked in recent days.\n\nJust last week for instance, Trump retweeted an image that pictures former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, behind bars. Trump often beams at rallies as his crowds chant \"lock her up!\" about the former Democratic nominee. And Michelle Obama wrote in her new autobiography that she will \"never forgive\" Trump for his conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace that launched the real estate mogul and reality TV star's political career.\n\nTrump is likely to come face to face with all four in the National Cathedral before a huge television audience. The encounter will highlight how several of the former leaders, including Obama and Clinton, forged close relationships with their Republican predecessor as well as the friendly relations between them and Bush's son, former President George W. Bush. No such ties exist between that trio and the current President, who often criticizes his predecessors and has given no sign of taking advantage of their advice and experience of doing one of the toughest and loneliest jobs in global politics.\n\nThe President also belittled another of the elder Bush's sons, former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, during the 2016 campaign, and in July, mocked a signature quote by the 41st president about a \"thousand points of light,\" which was later used as the name of his charity.\n\nUnavoidable comparisons\n\nWednesday's state funeral will offer similarities and contrasts to the final farewell for John McCain in September, to which Trump was not invited after mocking the Arizona senator during the 2016 campaign for being shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam nearly 50 years before.\n\nSuch analogies are likely to be perceived again in the tributes to Bush, who was almost universally regarded as a gentleman and a throwback to a more civil and magnanimous era of politics.\n\nStill, with Trump attending, and if he desists from his trademark inflammatory politics, the nation's divides could be papered over, at least for a few days.\n\nBush's passing also looks set to postpone one of the final political showdowns of the year \u2014 a funding controversy entangled in Trump's demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall.\n\nA source briefed on the talks told CNN that lawmakers are considering taking up a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown by a Friday deadline, since Congress will be out of session at the beginning of the week ahead of Bush's ceremonies.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would be open to such a solution.\n\n\"I would absolutely consider it and probably give it,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia cloud darkens over Trump\n\nWashington's period of mourning come at a fraught moment in Trump's presidency, after a week in which it became clear that Mueller is narrowing in on the President as his investigation gathers pace.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller unveiled a cooperation agreement with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen admitted to lying to Congress to cover up the fact that he was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow right up until June 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nHe had previously said talks about the Moscow project ended in January 2016 and said he lied out of a sense of obligation to Trump.\n\nA pair of developments on Friday night appeared to bring the probe even closer to the White House. CNN reported that Cohen believed that Trump would offer him a pardon in exchange for staying on message in in talks with federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump never indicated any such possibility to Cohen. But the report immediately sparked speculation about communications between the two men. Any proof that Trump had offered a pardon in return for Cohen's testimony would be an abuse of power and possibly an impeachable offense.\n\nThen, in a filing later on Friday, Cohen's lawyers offered the clearest sign yet that he kept Trump informed of his efforts to close the deal in Moscow in 2016.\n\nA political hiatus over the next few days might give Trump some brief relief from Russia questions but could also complicate his effort to celebrate an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stave off an escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn exchange, China will buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance, according to a White House statement."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The nation honors President George H.W.

Bush will be eulogized by former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose time in power overlapped with Bush, former US Sen. Alan Simpson, who became a close friend to Bush, and presidential historian Jon Meacham, the late president's biographer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will not speak at the funeral, sources with knowledge of the plans tell CNN, but has said that he will attend Wednesday's memorial. Despite the fact that Trump's rise to power included lambasting past presidents, including both Bushes, the President has responded to Bush's death with repeated laudatory comments.\n\nThe plans for Bush's funeral were all put into place before Trump was ever elected, sources tell CNN. Presidents are traditionally asked to eulogize presidents who have died -- and in past state events like this, that has been the case -- but the Bush family is unlike any other and has another president in the family who will fill that role.\n\nTrump will pay a condolence call to the Bush family on Tuesday at Blair House, according to the sources, a government house across the street from the White House.\n\nAs of Monday morning, all living Presidents are expected to attend Bush's funeral on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nPresidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are all expected to attend the service, according to sources familiar with the planning of the funeral. The current and all former first ladies are also expected to attend, except for Rosalynn Carter, according to the sources.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will also attend the funeral, an aide to Biden confirms.\n\nBush's passing has led to an outpouring of remembrances for the humble and gentlemanly statesman, whose life and service was seen to stand in direct contrast to the vitriol and partisanship that has enveloped elected politics in recent years. Many have also heralded Bush's 73-year marriage to his wife, Barbara Bush, who died months before her husband in April 2018.\n\nThose reflections will continue throughout the week, when Bush's casket travels from Houston, Bush's hometown, to Washington, DC to lie in state in the United States Capitol. Trump directed the presidential plane -- called Air Force One when the sitting President is aboard -- to pick up Bush's casket and transport it to Washington.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina where he was attending the G20 summit. \"So, we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBush will lie in state until Wednesday morning when his casket will then be transported to the National Cathedral for the first of two funeral services for the former president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence will offer brief remarks Monday at the evening ceremony at the Capitol before the public can visit the president lying in state. It is anticipated that foreign leaders will also be paying condolence calls to the family on Tuesday.\n\nThe German government press service announced Monday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will fly to Washington, DC, to take part in the memorial service for the late president, who oversaw the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany.\n\nOn Thursday, Bush's casket will travel back to Houston, where he will be memorialized at St. Martin's Episcopal Church and eulogized by his grandson, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, and former Secretary of State James Baker, a man who has been by Bush's side since the former president's failed 1970 Senate campaign in Texas.\n\nMembers of the family, including children and grandchildren, will be taking part in each service.\n\nBush's personal relationship with his Secret Service details will also be on full display throughout the week of events. The detail, made up of agents who enjoyed a close relationship with the former President, will be with him until he is interred and in the second vehicle in the motorcades that will lead to all the ceremonies.\n\nSome of the agents will also act as honorary pallbearers in Texas at the funeral home and Ellington Field, where Bush will begin his final flight back to Washington, DC.\n\nThe honorary pallbearers in Washington -- for both Bush's entry into the Rotunda and the National Cathedral -- will be Navy captains and admirals who have commanded the USS George H.W. Bush and members of the carrier strike group.\n\nBush's death has also led to a series of symbolic moments.\n\nBush had come to be known in recent years for his colorful and symbolic use of socks, wearing different pairs to express his mood or mark occasions. Jim McGrath, Bush's spokesman, tweeted on Monday that the 41st President \"will be carried to his final rest wearing socks that pay tribute to his lifetime of service, starting as an 18 year-old naval aviator in war.\"\n\nMcGrath also tweeted a photo of Sully, Bush's service dog, laying in front of the late President's casket on Sunday night with the caption, \"Mission Complete.\"\n\nSully is named after former airline pilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger III, who became famous for landing a damaged passenger jet on the Hudson River and saving all 155 passengers and crew in 2009.\n\nFollowing the week of services, Bush will be laid to rest on his presidential library grounds at Texas A&M University, where his wife and Robin, his daughter who died of leukemia in 1953, are buried."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "'Special Air Mission 41': Bush's final flights on 'Air Force One'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/X6iJj0wx61w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The late former president George H.W.

While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California, she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.\n\nBut that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM.\n\nEven on Facebook, his mother couldn't find kindred souls.\n\nThen, one day, a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.\n\nOlivera was in her last semester of nursing school, and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors, since her son's disease and polio are similar.\n\nThe members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.\n\nAFM and polio: eerie similarities\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio crippled more than 35,000 people a year on average, making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPolio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients, mainly children, start out with what looks like a cold or the flu, and then paralysis strikes.\n\nSince 2014, there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states, according to the CDC . The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.\n\nThanks to the polio vaccine, the US has been polio free since 1979 , according to the CDC.\n\nBut there is no cure or vaccine for AFM, and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.\n\nSome have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.\n\n\"I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory,\" Murray said. \"I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.\"\n\nBailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.\"Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again,\" Mikell Sheehan said.\n\n\n\nBailey Sheehan's physical therapist, Melissa Murray, researched care for children with polio to help Bailey recover from AFM.\n\nLooking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is \"extraordinary,\" according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of \"Polio: An American Story,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.\n\n\"To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that,\" he said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?\n\nThen she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.\n\nIt was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.\n\nShe knew she was in the right place.\n\nSo did the polio survivors.\n\n\"Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.\n\nThe survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.\n\n\"They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'\" Olivera remembers. \"So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!\"\n\nAs Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.\n\nSeeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.\n\n\"Hey, cover that thing up,\" a passerby yelled.\n\nHe was referring to her leg brace.\n\n\"I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!\" remembers Puch, who's now 65. \"I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?\"\n\nShe told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.\n\n\"When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children,\" Puch said.\n\nThat advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.\n\n\"Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all,\" she remembers. \"After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.\"\n\n\"We were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability,\" Erin Olivera said.\n\nToday, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.\n\nNot wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, \" Too Early for Flowers ,\" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAfter the meeting, one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks, since people with paralysis often have cold feet.\n\nThe socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life.\n\n\"That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight,\" she said. \"They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things, too.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Report gays to me': Why Tanzania's LGBT live in fear", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/L8_iuHAPAW0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "One day, she could walk down the street like anyone else. People still stared and often judged but in their own minds -- not out loud.\n\nBut before she knew it, she was dodging abuse and stones thrown at her by strangers, as well as familiar faces.\n\n\"Since the announcement was made, things got worse,\" said the 23-year-old trans woman from Tanzania, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear for her safety.\n\nShe was called derogatory names for being trans and one night was slapped by two men who had been following her, but she managed to run home fast enough to prevent further abuse, she says.\n\n\"The feeling is unexplainable,\" she said. She began questioning the world, her life and who she was. \"You start thinking, 'what species am I? Where do I belong?' \"\n\nThe announcement that she says changed her life was made by powerful politician Paul Makonda, regional governor of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. At the end of October, he vowed to set up a task force to round up and arrest people suspected of being gay.\n\nShe first identified as a trans woman in 2016, having previously considered herself to be a gay man. \"It took courage,\" she said. \"Tanzania is a very religious country.\"\n\nAlthough she was \"very intelligent\" about coming out and about going only to known LGBT-friendly settings, she now feels that things have taken several steps back.\n\nFour weeks ago, she fled her home in Dar es Salaam to go to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, with the help of Kenya-based nongovernmental organization Jinsiangu, which is supported by the International AIDS Alliance and its Rapid Response Fund.\n\n\"It was so bad, I had go,\" she said. The organization gave her transportation and money to relocate and start a new life in Nairobi.\n\n\"I'm free here,\" she said.\n\n'If you know any gays, report them to me'\n\nMakonda's call for all gay people to be reported to him initiated a chain reaction in the country, forcing many into hiding.\n\nStating that his phone number is widely known, \"I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays, report them to me,\" Makonda said at a news conference October 29.\n\nPaul Makonda, a politician in Tanzania, launched an anti-gay crackdown, threatening to arrest people suspected of being homosexuals.\n\nPeople already faced a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzania for gay male sex, a holdover from colonial-era laws, mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. As a result of that law, the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.\n\nUnder the administration of President John Magufuli, rights groups believe, the situation has gotten worse, with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.\n\nBut the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.\n\nAfter intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans, stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's \"views are not the view of the government.\"\n\nBut the repercussions had begun.\n\nSince the announcement, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says, it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund, which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania, the grants have provided basics like transport, medical help and shelter.\n\nMany of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks, the alliance said.\n\nThose unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding, kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services, such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.\n\nSouth African members of the LGBTQI community protest outside the Tanzania High Commission.\n\n'HIV is so much higher in those populations'\n\nBeing forced to be \"invisible\" due to \"public antagonism\" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police, said Christine Stegling, executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\n\"All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations,\" she said, explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.\n\nAccording to 2014 UNAIDS data, 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population.\n\nA gay man in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who for many years received condoms and medical attention from local outreach efforts, worries about what will happen now that those outreach programs have been suspended for the gay community.\n\nGlobally, according to UNAIDS, new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.\n\nThe region where \"HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa, the second highest is the Caribbean, and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior,\" Chris Beyrer, the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told CNN.\n\n\"It's impossible to say there is direct causality, but there certainly is a very strong correlation.\"\n\nBeing forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification, Stegling said.\n\n\"You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex, sexuality and conversations around HIV,\" she said. \"In the last couple of years, there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics, making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs.\"\n\nStegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.\n\nWe know what to do, but we can't do it, she said.

The government is \"making us fear, like we are not human beings.\"\n\nFaki has been openly homosexual for just a few years, having gained the courage to come out through attending training and information sessions with local community groups.\n\nTwo years ago, he and two fellow activists formed an organization to work primarily with LGBT groups on his home island of Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. Though the island's prejudice is not as extreme as in Dar es Salaam, he says, his team has helped many LGBT people get out of prison and fight for their rights against local police.

Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, the city has no other choice. On average, 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country.\n\nOne of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now, El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps.\n\nIncreasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought, according to the federal government's most recentnational climate assessment. Already challenged with balancing the demands of about 700,000 thirsty El Pasoans along with agriculture and industry needs, El Paso must also face the fact that climate change is literally drying up one of its major sources of water.\n\nAnalyzing tree ring records, scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen, the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.\n\n\"We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s,\" said J. Phillip King, a professor of civil engineering at New Mexico State University. King has tracked the river's water levels for the past 27 years as an adviser to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District. The district manages the water distribution of some 90,000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nKing told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958, the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.\n\nKing called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. \"You know we've already gotten critically low here, and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate,\" he said.\n\nDrought isn't anything new for the 1,800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts, King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate. And that means not only potentially less snowfall but a greater chance for water to evaporate.\n\nThe federal government projects that temperatures could rise an additional 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the region by 2100.\n\nnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir, just outside of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers fromnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. Currently , it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now, they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin.\n\nFinding alternatives\n\nFor those who rely on the river, like the city of El Paso, they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity.\n\nIt is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989, he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan, he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers.\n\n\"I thought, we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources,\" he told Gupta.\n\nExpanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater, Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio.\n\nFarmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river, including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property, so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.\n\nDavid Gutzler, a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico, likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. \"If you can mix and match, then you use one or the other,\" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient, he said.\n\nBut in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water, Archuleta made water.\n\nHe lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant.\n\nAccording to El Paso Water's hydrologists, under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on, there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water.\n\nIt's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20,000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.\n\nProducing water\n\nToda,y the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year, El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water.\n\n\"This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought,\" Archuleta said.\n\nHe also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from.\n\nThe city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.\n\nWhen Archuleta retired in 2013, water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago, despite having 170,000 more people to serve.\n\nDrinking treated sewage\n\nToday, El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals, it's called \"direct potable reuse\" or \"advanced purification.\"\n\n\"It's the logical next step for us to take,\" said Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water.\n\nEl Paso; Orange County, California; Scottsdale, Arizona, and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.\n\nThis treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes.\n\nEl Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer, the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.\n\n\"We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality,\" Trejo explained to Gupta. \"The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA , the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied, providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water.\n\nclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. To make sure the water isclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration.

Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched, said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. \"These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well.\"\n\nArchuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment.\n\n\"Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption, they take it pretty well.\"\n\nBy 2030, El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply, and 6% will of come from advanced purification.\n\nTrejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso, it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water.\n\n\"Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink.

Hide Caption 6 of 6\n\nHe has since received an EPA grant of nearly $2 million to seek out water issues in towns like Enterprise.\n\nThe EPA and the federal government do offer grants and loans to towns. But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right? We're all neighbors we all know each other it's the human, right thing to do.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Destroyed: How the trashing of rape kits failed victims and jeopardizes public safety", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DPfoz5Rd6Cw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Editor\u2019s note These stories contain graphic language used in police documents on rape cases. CNN chose to quote directly from the documents rather than use vague or euphemistic language that fails to convey the violence of the crimes. Reporters were unable to identify and reach most victims because police redacted their names, addresses and other identifying information in the case files. Where police did not redact that information, CNN did, including the full names of suspects who were not charged.\n\nHours after you are raped, you sit in a hospital room, under fluorescent lights, and consent to a forensic exam. Your body is the crime scene. When did it happen, a nurse asks. Where did it happen? Can you tell me who did this to you? The nurse is trained to interview you and search your body for evidence left behind by your attacker. Knowing the details of your assault guides the examination. Did he ejaculate inside of you, on you? Where did he touch you? Did he use any objects? Did he kiss you, lick you? Have you had anything to drink? Did you shower? You\u2019re asked to undress slowly while you stand on a special sheet meant to collect any trace evidence that shakes loose. For three to five hours, the nurse swabs your mouth, your breasts, a bite mark on your neck. She scrapes under your fingernails, combs your pubic hair. She inserts a speculum inside you and drops blue dye on the tissue there to illuminate any places that are torn. The nurse cuts a hair from your head. She takes photographs of your face and shoulders to pair with your chart, of you in the clothes you wore when you were attacked. Every injury is photographed, too \u2014 far away, close-up, with a ruler to show size. When the exam is over, the nurse puts hair, fibers, swabs, vials of blood and urine in a container smaller than a shoebox. She seals it \u2014 your rape kit \u2014 and entrusts it to a police officer. This North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed. Read her full story here: \u2018They treated me like trash.\u2019 Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN This is the way DNA evidence is collected. This is what you endure so police can identify your assailant, make him pay for what he did. No one tells you that the exam may be pointless \u2014 that police might treat your kit like trash. A CNN investigation into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. The number is likely higher and was arrived at through an analysis of the departments\u2019 own records. The destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete investigations that relegated rape kits to shelves in police evidence rooms until they were destroyed. Dozens were trashed mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence, records showed. Almost 80% were never tested for DNA evidence, a process that can identify a suspect or link that person to other crimes. For the past several years, public attention has focused on the hundreds of thousands of kits that have languished untested. The Justice Department has awarded more than $150 million to test that backlog. But destruction of rape kits is a lesser-known and more fundamental problem: The evidence is gone. It can never be used to lock up a rapist or set free the wrongfully convicted. Rape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN \u201cAll the attention toward untested kits isn\u2019t enough if we have agencies destroying kits,\u201d said Wayne County, Michigan, Prosecutor Kym Worthy, whose testing of some 10,000 backlogged rape kits has identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. \u201cEach one of these kits represents a victim,\u201d said the Detroit-based prosecutor. \u201cWhat you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\u201d What you are doing [\u2026] is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice. Kym Worthy | Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor A woman who reported being gang-raped in 2007 said it was \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d to recently learn that police destroyed her untested kit. She remembered the nurse at a hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, asking her to describe what the four men did so that her body could be positioned in a way that allowed for more precise examination. \u201cIt was very invasive,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was very degrading. The level of exposure \u2026 was a second violation.\u201d But she steeled herself because the nurse was collecting evidence, and she believed police would test it and use it in their investigation. Instead, CNN found, the detective assigned to her case did nothing more than interview her. The officer never tried to talk to the men she named as her attackers, misinterpreted the law and concluded that no rape occurred. About a month after speaking with the woman, the detective authorized destruction of the untested rape kit \u2014 in a state where there was no time limit to prosecute rape. \u201cI counted on the police to do what they were supposed to do \u2014 to investigate what happened to me and to test that evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, they treated it like trash. They treated me like trash.\u201d For some victims, the rape exam feels like a second trauma. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Veteran sex crimes investigators, along with experts in the law, trauma and forensic science, reviewed case files for CNN. They said investigations indicated that police lacked training in how to interact with victims of sexual violence; in the importance of testing kits, not only to solve the reported assaults but potentially other crimes; and in the need to preserve kits for the length of time the law allows for a prosecution. \u201cWhat CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\u201d said Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant who ran the San Diego Police sex crimes unit for a decade. She examined 56 case files from more than a dozen departments. What CNN discovered is a systemic problem. Joanne Archambault | Former head of San Diego Police sex crimes unit \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2014 but it\u2019s not the norm \u2014 that law enforcement should keep evidence at least for the statute of limitations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are mistakes in these cases, but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\u201d Twenty-five agencies in 14 states destroyed kits tied to cases while they could still be prosecuted. Department leaders at some agencies defended the destruction by saying officers approved disposal of kits in closed cases they believed had no chance of moving forward. This was a routine process, they said, done to make space in evidence rooms. Who destroyed? Law enforcement agencies responded to CNN\u2019s findings. At least five departments acknowledged that the decision to destroy kits was made without considering the statutes of limitations. Three stopped trashing kits because of CNN\u2019s inquiries. Experts said the destruction shows that rape is treated differently than other violent crimes. \u201cWould we test all the evidence\u201d in a murder? \u201cYou bet,\u201d said police trainer Tom Tremblay. The former Vermont police chief, who has reviewed rape investigations for the US Department of Justice, examined cases from nine agencies. The language police sometimes used, he and other experts said, suggested bias \u2014 describing victims\u2019 accounts of their rapes as \u201chaving sex,\u201d asking whether victims experienced orgasms and focusing on a victim\u2019s behavior rather than the suspect\u2019s. All of it, Tremblay said, communicates one thing to a victim: You are not believed. Kym Worthy: The prosecutor is herself a rape survivor. She calls the destruction of rape kits a betrayal. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Worthy understands personally what\u2019s at stake. She isn\u2019t just a prosecutor; she\u2019s a survivor. She was raped in law school, she said, and \u2014 like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally \u2014 chose not to report her attack. It is a triumph, Worthy said, when a victim musters the courage to go to police and consent to a rape exam. And destroying a rape kit is a betrayal.\n\nDuring a life-threatening trauma like rape, the defense circuitry of the brain drives the victim\u2019s sole objective: to survive. Reflexes govern reaction \u2014 running away, punching the attacker, lying there paralyzed. Stress hormones can impair a victim\u2019s memory and the ability to make complex, rational decisions. Investigators trained in the effects of trauma know that a victim\u2019s first account of an assault may not be complete, experts said, and it may not be the best time to ask some questions. Yet documents CNN examined showed officers sometimes asked questions that threatened to overwhelm victims or put them on the defensive. Did you say no? Did you fight back? Why didn\u2019t you call police right away? Though experts say victims should be interviewed wherever they feel most comfortable, documents showed police sometimes ask them to come to the station, just as they do suspects. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A traumatized person\u2019s instinct is often to avoid the pain that can come from retelling or reliving the experience. Avoidance and withdrawal are common symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But when victims pulled away from investigations soon after they reported being assaulted, when the trauma was fresh, some police officers were quick to label them uncooperative and close their cases. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to sniff out the liar,\u201d said Justin Boardman, a former Utah police detective who teaches cops how to understand trauma. \u201cSo when you don\u2019t give us this training that says \u2014 \u2018Oh, she\u2019s pulling away because she\u2019s traumatized, or she can\u2019t tell me this detail because she legit can\u2019t remember\u2019 \u2014 we think she\u2019s lying or she\u2019s hiding something.\u201d Experts who reviewed cases said detectives appeared to rush victims into making consequential decisions, effectively ending some cases. They noted that investigators violated longstanding best practices by asking victims if they wanted to prosecute their attackers soon after reporting the assaults to police \u2014 sometimes the same day. That question, they said, can intimidate victims and cause them to withdraw. Resources For help, survivors can call 800-656-4673. More guidance for victims and training for investigators can be found here. Prosecution should be discussed only after a thorough investigation is complete, experts said, when a prosecutor \u2014 not a victim \u2014 has determined that charges can be filed. Some victims who expressed reluctance to proceed with a prosecution were asked to sign forms attesting to that. But victims should not be given waivers declining prosecution, according to guidelines by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as far back as 2005. Only the statute of limitations should constrain a victim\u2019s right to change her or his mind about moving forward with a prosecution, the association says. More recently issued guidelines also stress that an investigator should try to spend time building rapport with a victim. Unless the public is in imminent danger, law enforcement should work at a pace comfortable for the victim. Some case files showed detectives closed cases and called victims uncooperative if they didn\u2019t meet arbitrary deadlines. In North Charleston, South Carolina, a woman reported being raped at knifepoint by a man who had once been a sexual partner. Police noted she\u2019d been arrested for prostitution two years earlier and quizzed her about whether he was a client. She told them no. Though she did not know her assailant\u2019s name, she called police twice after her initial interview with information she thought might help identify him, according to the case file. But when she failed to return a detective\u2019s call in a week\u2019s time, he wrote that she was uncooperative and ended the investigation 17 days after she reported being raped. Her kit \u2014 never tested \u2014 was destroyed less than a year later, even though testing might have identified the man. There was no statute of limitations on the crime, meaning the woman should have had as much time as she needed to help police pursue her assailant. Rape survivors expect the evidence taken from their bodies to be sealed up, given to police and sent to a lab for testing. CNN found hundreds of kits were destroyed without being analyzed. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN North Charleston\u2019s detective bureau commander, Major Scott Perry, declined to specify why the kit was destroyed. \u201cEach case is evaluated on its own facts,\u201d he said, adding that the investigation could be reopened at any time if the victim re-approached police. He conceded, however, that not having the rape kit would make the case \u201cmore difficult to prosecute.\u201d In Springfield, Missouri, police labeled victims uncooperative when they didn\u2019t respond to letters mailed to their homes warning that they had 10 business days to contact a detective or their assaults would not be further investigated. In at least six cases, records show, a detective sent the letter the day the officer was assigned to investigate. The victims had undergone rape exams and given initial accounts to patrol officers, actions that demonstrated a desire for the crimes to be investigated. But when victims didn\u2019t meet that 10-day deadline, Springfield police sometimes sent another letter, telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d to respond led to the closing of their cases. The kits were later destroyed, even though the crimes remained within the statutes of limitations. \u2018Failure\u2019 to cooperate When Springfield victims didn\u2019t meet detectives\u2019 deadlines, police sent another letter telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d led to the closing of their cases. Source: Springfield Police Department Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said the 10-day letter is a tool used in all kinds of cases to spur a victim to work with police. He said investigators should use it only as a last resort \u2014 after a detective has exhausted every other means to reach a victim. He did not explain why some letters were sent immediately after victims reported being raped. The letter is \u201ca way to justify not doing your job,\u201d said Archambault, the retired San Diego sex crimes investigator who reviewed cases. It should never be sent to rape victims, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous. This type of response will guarantee that the majority of victims will not participate in the investigation.\u201d Victims sometimes leave their homes because they are afraid an attacker will find them again. It\u2019s \u201cabsurd,\u201d she said, to expect victims to check the mail and respond to a demand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that [victims] are being uncooperative. They\u2019re just dealing with survival. They\u2019re trying to get out of bed, get their clothes on, get to work, get the kids to school,\u201d Archambault said. Police should instead give victims time \u2014 and access to counseling and services that help them feel safe, experts said. After that, they are far more likely to work with law enforcement. Joanne Archambault: The former sex crimes investigator says police label victims uncooperative, but \u201cthey\u2019re just dealing with survival.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A woman in West Valley, Utah, said she told police she was terrified that her rapist would hunt her down again, but she received neither time nor support. According to her case file, the woman told a patrol officer that a man she\u2019d broken up with came to her home and raped her. He ordered her to \u201cshut her mouth,\u201d or he would \u201churt her,\u201d she told the officer. He forced her into his car. She said she eventually managed to jump out and run into a K-Mart, where someone called 911. The woman gave police an initial statement about the assault and underwent a rape exam. Ten days later, on January 27, 2009, Detective Ryan Humphrey noted that she called him. She said she was \u201cscared to pursue charges,\u201d he wrote in the case file. He shut down the investigation. CNN reached the woman, who was upset to learn that her rape kit was destroyed and never tested. She called the failure to analyze it \u201cpathetic.\u201d Police did not offer to take steps to protect her, she said. If they had, she might have gained confidence and worked with police. She said she wishes they\u2019d told her, \u201c\u2018Well, we can still help you through this.\u2019\u201d (She asked that her name be withheld, and CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims.) Humphrey, who no longer works for the department, said that in the 10 days between the woman\u2019s report and her phone call, he did not try to locate and interview the suspect or do any other work on the case. Like investigators at other agencies, Humphrey said resources were tight, and he struggled under the weight of a heavy caseload. He closed the investigation, he said, because he assumed that the district attorney wouldn\u2019t file charges in a case without a victim\u2019s cooperation. As he reflected on the case, he acknowledged he could have given the woman more time by leaving the case open and trying to build trust and rapport with her. He could have done what experts said is protocol: offer her a safety plan to allay her fears, such as patrolling near her home or helping her file a restraining order. He agreed that the woman could have changed her mind and re-engaged when she was ready \u2014 her right in a state that had no statute of limitations to prosecute rape at the time she reported the crime. \u201cObviously, she wanted to pursue it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she went to the hospital and had a rape exam done.\u201d A specially trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner may spend three to five hours or more gathering evidence from a victim\u2019s body. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Humphrey said he did not authorize destruction of the woman\u2019s rape kit but understood that once he closed a case, the evidence would be disposed. Her kit should have been preserved, he said. Not keeping the investigation open was \u201ca mistake. I look back at this case and can see that\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere are many obstacles to a successful rape investigation. A victim is too scared to continue working with police. A suspect claims sex was consensual. Testing a kit doesn\u2019t crack a case. But those circumstances shouldn\u2019t necessarily end an investigation. Officers can press pause and set cases aside, then reopen them if there\u2019s a break \u2014 a victim changes his or her mind, new leads emerge, technology improves and evidence can be retested. Yet CNN identified 17 departments that destroyed a combined 92 kits in sex crimes investigations that police described as open or in other terms that mean the same thing, such as inactive or suspended. In Idaho, Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Chief Lee White acknowledged that his department discarded rape kits in cases marked inactive. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cit appears we were too quick at the trigger to dispose.\u201d In Farmington, New Mexico, police reported destroying kits in at least eight cases labeled inactive. Chief Steve Hebbe reviewed those cases and said the kits should not have been trashed. He then ordered a major change. \u201cWe will not destroy sexual assault kits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy them until after the statute of limitations is out.\u201d The chief also said he made sure his officers received fresh training in sex crimes investigations. Proper training includes an understanding of what DNA testing can do \u2014 even when suspects claim sex was consensual. In several departments, CNN found officers failed to test kits in so-called consent cases because they believed testing would only demonstrate that sex occurred, not whether a crime occurred. That\u2019s short-sighted, experts said. A DNA profile of the suspect in a consent case could match a DNA profile of an unidentified attacker in another rape, connecting those crimes and helping to solve them both. The testing of the backlog in Wayne County, Michigan, has linked kits in \u201cconsent\u201d cases to suspects in other sexual assaults, said prosecutor Worthy. CNN also discovered cases in which police listed \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d as a reason to destroy kits that were never analyzed. Testing might have produced evidence, advancing investigations while there was still time to prosecute. Even a tested kit that fails to yield DNA evidence during an initial analysis should be preserved, forensic experts said, because testing technology is constantly improving. DNA that couldn\u2019t be detected just a few years ago can sometimes be recovered today. Nakamura memo Two police departments \u2014 Salt Lake City and West Valley \u2014 continued to destroy rape kits after Salt Lake County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Blake Nakamura said he sent them a 2011 memo ordering that evidence be maintained. Source: Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office Blake Nakamura, the chief deputy prosecutor in Utah\u2019s Salt Lake County, said he came to understand the importance of preserving evidence in sex crimes cases years ago. Nakamura has been on both sides in the courtroom. As a private defense attorney, he successfully defended a man accused of sexually abusing a child by blocking the admission of evidence. When he became a prosecutor, he wanted to be able to admit all evidence and knew he had to protect rape kits from destruction. So in 2011, he sent a memo to police departments in his county, notifying them to keep all evidence in sex offense cases. At least two failed to follow his directive: Salt Lake City and West Valley. They provided records to CNN showing they continued to destroy kits for at least a couple more years. They also provided documentation showing why: Prosecutors in Nakamura\u2019s office approved the destruction. When CNN showed those records to Nakamura, he was irate. He later spoke with his staff in colorful language he said he couldn\u2019t share. But the prosecutor feels certain they got his message.\n\nIt is particularly egregious, experts said, to destroy rape kits belonging to children, the most vulnerable victims. Young victims often can\u2019t express what happened to them, so their rape kits can speak for them. The evidence can prove abuse because suspects, unlike in adult cases, can\u2019t argue that sexual contact was consensual. Children who report being sexually assaulted should be interviewed by experts trained in dealing with young victims. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Statutes of limitations for teenagers and children typically do not start until victims reach adulthood. \u201cIt takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\u201d said Marci Hamilton, a professor and attorney who analyzed juvenile cases for CNN to determine whether they had been destroyed before the statutes of limitations. \u201cWhat police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\u201d Hamilton and CNN identified 47 children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 rape kits that were destroyed before the statutes of limitations expired or where there was no time limit to prosecute. At least 39 were untested. CNN\u2019s analysis did not include \u201cunfounded\u201d cases, those in which police determined that no crime was attempted or occurred. But Hamilton, whose non-profit CHILD USA advocates for sexual abuse victims, argued that given the complexity of child sex abuse, juvenile reports should rarely be labeled unfounded. In Fallon, Nevada, a detective dismissed a 7-year-old\u2019s case as unfounded, partly because the child looked away from him as he questioned her in 2013. The girl described how a man had assaulted her anally, orally and vaginally the previous night, and then methodically cleansed her body. Even though the child was consistent in describing the incident to others, the detective said her body language \u2014 looking away \u2014 indicated she was being deceptive. The detective suggested to her parents that they get her psychological help. Marci Hamilton: The head of CHILD USA says children rarely report sexual abuse when it happens; when they do, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary. When they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Police destroyed the girl\u2019s untested rape kit seven months after the allegations of abuse were made. Experts said the 7-year-old\u2019s account should have raised a red flag; until children reach puberty and start to have sexual urges, they are generally incapable of imagining rape scenarios. The detective, they added, seemed to judge the child\u2019s body language as he would an adult\u2019s. The police chief in Fallon, Kevin Gehman, said the girl\u2019s account was fully investigated but acknowledged \u201csome weaknesses in the investigative process.\u201d He would not elaborate. CNN\u2019s questions about the case prompted a review of all sexual assault investigations by the police and the city attorney. As a result, the attorney instructed police to stop destroying rape kits. The statutes of limitations on sex crimes against children typically do not begin ticking until they reach legal adulthood. Melissa Golden/REDUX for CNN Hamilton and other experts said it is rare for minors to disclose abuse soon after it occurs. Out of fear or confusion \u2014 or because predators manipulate them \u2014 young victims may delay talking about what happened for years, if not decades. That\u2019s all the more reason to maintain their rape kits. When children report what happened immediately, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhen they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit backstop plan is calculated risk - Geoffrey Cox", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46419790", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cox: Brexit backstop a 'calculated risk' for UK\n\nThe UK would be \"indefinitely committed\" to EU customs rules if Brexit trade talks broke down, the chief law officer has said.\n\nBut Geoffrey Cox said it would not be in either side's political interests to allow that to happen.\n\nThe attorney general said it was a \"calculated risk\" and \"I do not believe we will be trapped in it permanently\".\n\nLabour accused him of \"hiding\" the full legal advice on the Brexit deal \"for fear of the political consequences\".\n\nIt came after Mr Cox published an overview of his legal advice on Brexit, which he described to MPs as a \"commentary\".\n\nLabour is leading a cross-party bid - including the Lib Dems, the SNP, the Democratic Unionist Party, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party - to get Mr Cox to publish his full advice.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said they had \"been left with no option but to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt\".\n\nMPs voted last month to require the government to lay before Parliament \"any legal advice in full\".\n\nMr Cox mounted an impassioned defence of his decision not to publish the full advice, insisting it would not be \"in the national interest\" to break a longstanding convention that law officers' advice to ministers is confidential.\n\nHe said he would answer all MPs' questions and there was no cover-up, adding: \"There is nothing to see here.\"\n\nHe angrily told MPs calling for it to be published to \"grow up and get real\", prompting Green MP Caroline Lucas to accuse him of indulging in \"amateur dramatics\" and turning the debate into a \"farce\".\n\nNigel Dodds, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, told Mr Cox MPs needed to see the full legal advice he had given to the government - and denounced the Irish \"backstop\" plan as \"deeply unattractive\".\n\nThe Northern Ireland \"backstop\" is a last-resort plan designed to prevent a return to a visible border on the island of Ireland, with both the UK and the EU saying they want to avoid anything which puts the peace process at risk.\n\nIt would be triggered if no trade deal has been agreed with the EU that avoids the need for a hard border by the end of the 21-month transition period after 29 March's official departure date.\n\nIt would keep the whole of the UK tied to EU customs rules, unless the two sides come up with another way of avoiding border checks.\n\nUnder the EU withdrawal agreement, neither side can unilaterally withdraw from it - but it is meant to be temporary.\n\n'Weighed up against alternatives'\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Cox said: \"I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit if negotiations had irretrievably broken down, but I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently.\"\n\nHe went on: \"This represents a sensible compromise; it has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us, but the question for the House is to weigh it up against the other potential alternatives and to assess whether it amounts to a calculated risk that this government and this House should take in these circumstances, weighed up against the realities of the alternatives.\"\n\nMr Cox's statement to the House of Commons will be followed by five days of debate on the proposed Brexit deal, which will get under way on Tuesday.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019.

The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many.\n\nThe Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia.\n\nThis bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,\" said S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.\n\nWill President Trump and the US feature at all?\n\nAlthough the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24.\n\nHowever, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels. A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates.\n\nUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018\n\nThe summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions.

Her dementia was progressing and my dad's health was getting worse.\"\n\n'We found a fantastic home'\n\nAt the time Russell and Maureen were living in West Yorkshire, but Sandy and her brother were both living in the south of England.\n\nThe family decided the best solution would be for Russell and Maureen to sell the family home and move nearer to their children.\n\nThat meant finding a nursing home for Maureen and a new property for Russell.\n\nRussell, who is now 85, ended up buying a bungalow very close to his son's home in Wiltshire, while Maureen, now 86, moved into a nursing home run in neighbouring Berkshire.\n\n\"It's a fantastic home.

and if there is an opportunity to influence it\", with probiotics for example, although Dr Neumann stressed such a conclusion was purely speculative at this stage.\n\nProf Tobias Welte, President of the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study, welcomed further research.\n\n\"There is an association between respiratory symptoms in babies in the first year of life and the development of asthma by school age.\n\n\"We do not yet fully understand this link but the bacteria living in the upper airways could play a role.\n\n\"We need to do more research to understand the relationship between these bacteria, respiratory infections and long-term lung health.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "The people living on the NHS waiting list", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46384797", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:49", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Liz Clarke faced a nine-month wait for a new hip\n\nWhile trying to decipher the often overwhelming mass of data on waiting times in the NHS, it can be easy to forget that behind each statistic is a person living with the pain and anxiety of waiting.\n\nFor BBC Scotland's Disclosure series, I went to meet some of those Living on the NHS List.\n\nThe 12-week treatment time guarantee\n\nImage caption Liz needs a stick when she is teaching line dancing\n\nLiz Clarke is 74 and used to be a champion at line dancing.\n\nShe took me to a class she teaches in Killcreggan on the Argyll Coast.\n\nI couldn't help but love Liz and her class but she was having a tough night.\n\nLiz needs a new hip and has been told she is facing an eight or nine-month wait instead of the 12-week guarantee.\n\nImage caption Liz needs a stick and strong pain killers to get through the day\n\nShe needs a stick and strong pain killers to get through the day.\n\nShe tells me: \"I really do love life and you know you get hit with this, honestly, I would say, unbearable pain.\n\n\"If you've ever had toothache, it's toothache 24 hours a day.\n\n\"And there are times when you feel near suicidal because of the pain.\"\n\nImage caption Liz Clarke is in the Line Dancing Hall of Fame\n\nThe Scottish government introduced the 12-week treatment time guarantee (TTG) in 2012.\n\nScotland is the only part of the UK where patients have a legal right to get treatment for inpatient or day care within that three-month period.\n\nBut it is a law that is regularly broken.\n\nIn total, more than 170,000 people have not had their treatment within the 12-week guarantee.\n\nThe 62-day cancer waiting time\n\nImage caption Halinka was referred to hospital for tests to rule out gallstones\n\nI travelled to Aberdeen to meet Halinka Kerr.\n\nShe is in her 50s and runs a hair and beauty salon.\n\nLast year she was referred to hospital for tests to rule out gallstones.\n\nIt turned out she had kidney cancer.\n\nShe waited more than 150 days for an operation to remove her kidney.\n\nAfter the operation, Halinka was told she was cancer free but then doctors discovered it had spread to her bones and is now incurable.\n\nImage caption Halinka runs a hair and beauty salon\n\nShe said: \"When you're told you're cancer-free, it's so emotional.\n\n\"And then you're told by the afternoon that there's more cancer?

He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting.\n\n\"The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already \"a matter of life and death\" for many countries.\n\nHe explained that the world is \"nowhere near where it needs to be\" on the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nBut the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to \"right the ship\" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal'\n\nWhat's so different about this meeting?\n\nThis Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October.\n\nThe IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030.\n\nBut a recent study showed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action.\n\nThey say \"decisive action in the next two years will be crucial\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nMeanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider.\n\nSo urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start.\n\nWill global leaders be attending?\n\nYes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting.\n\nThe number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment.\n\nBut for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical.

Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action.\n\n\"We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,\" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF.\n\n\"Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast.\"\n\nWhy is the UN process slow-moving?\n\nThere is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians.\n\nImage copyright HANNA FRANZEN Image caption Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24\n\n\"Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,\" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues.\n\n\"Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture.\"\n\nOthers involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world.\n\n\"We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nHow much of a role will money play in making progress in Poland?\n\nMany developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement.\n\nSome are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting.\n\n\"A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,\" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\nAre there concerns the meeting is in a country reliant on coal?\n\nYes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many.\n\nThe Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia.\n\nThis bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,\" said S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.\n\nWill President Trump and the US feature at all?\n\nAlthough the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24.\n\nHowever, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels. A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates.\n\nUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018\n\nThe summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions.

All of the new detections come from the second period of operation, which ran for nearly nine months from November 2016 to August 2017.\n\nIn the catalogue, they are given the \"GW\" prefix, for \"Gravitational Waves\", followed by the date (yr/month/day) of occurrence: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818 and GW170823.\n\nSkip Youtube post by SXS Collaboration Warning: Third party content may contain adverts Report End of Youtube post by SXS Collaboration\n\nGravitational waves - Ripples in the fabric of space-time\n\nImage copyright NSF Image caption The LIGO Louisiana lab has 4km-long pipes running out from its control centre\n\nGravitational waves are a prediction of the Theory of General Relativity\n\nIt took decades to develop the technology to directly detect them\n\nThey are ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by violent events\n\nAccelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed of light\n\nDetectable sources include merging black holes and neutron stars\n\nLIGO/VIRGO fire lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb the light\n\nDetecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new investigations\n\nWhat of the uncertain candidate?\n\nThe advanced laser labs in Washington and Louisiana began their first science run in September 2015 and almost immediately made the historic detection of a black hole merger on 14 September (GW150914), a discovery that would later earn a Nobel Prize.\n\nBut less than a month later, the alarms triggered again at the lab to raise the possibility of a second detection. At the time, scientists didn't think this event met the necessary criteria for a confident discovery, and so they labelled it LVT151012, where LVT stood for \"LIGO-VIRGO Trigger\".\n\nIt was frequently mentioned in communications, but could not really be counted in the catalogue of full detections.\n\nThis has now changed following the re-analysis. The criteria are met and the LVT prefix is replaced with GW.\n\nProf Christopher Berry at Northwestern called GW151012 a \"Cinderella story, a quiet signal that could\".\n\nWhat do these extra detections mean?\n\nThe hunt for gravitational waves is a game of statistics.\n\nFrom the number of detections so far made, scientists can extrapolate the likely number of black holes in a given volume of space. So, that number has just gone up.\n\nAlso, the expanded catalogue tells us something about the probable future success of the laser laboratories.\n\nThey are currently offline for upgrades that will improve their performance.\n\nWhen they come back online in spring next year, they should have the ability to sense twice the distance, with hopefully therefore eight times the detection rate.\n\nWe are rapidly moving towards a time when the detection of gravitational waves becomes a daily occurrence.\n\nAnd as that happens, new details will emerge about the nature of black holes and neutron stars, and - with luck - about some completely novel and unexpected sources of gravitational waves.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Osiris-Rex: Nasa probe arrives at Asteroid Bennu", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46428018", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Asteroid Bennu: Osiris-Rex's home for the next couple of years\n\nThe American space agency's Osiris-Rex probe has drawn up alongside the Asteroid Bennu after a two-year, two-billion-km journey from Earth.\n\nThe mission will spend 2.5 years at the 500m-wide rock, mapping its surface and studying its composition.\n\nIn mid-2020, scientists will direct Osiris-Rex to drop down to the object and grab at least 60g of regolith, or \"top soil\".\n\nThis will be packed away in a sterile capsule to be returned home in 2023.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: Osiris-Rex will extend a robotic arm and \"high five\" Bennu with its collection device\n\nControllers commanded the robotic probe on Monday to fire its thrusters for 20 seconds.\n\nThis enabled Osiris-Rex to match Bennu's velocity through space, and bring it to about 7km from the rock at closest approach.\n\nIn the coming days, the spacecraft will get a little closer to begin its preliminary survey.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Fourth US Soldier Dies From Wounds in Afghanistan Blast", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fourth-us-soldier-dies-from-wounds-in-last-week-s-afghanistan-blast/4684729.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "The Pentagon says a fourth soldier has died from wounds suffered last week in a roadside bomb blast in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nSgt.

He threatened to tear it up and withdraw the United States completely at times during the negotiation, which would have left trade between the three neighbors in disarray.\n\nThe three were still bickering over the finer points of the deal just hours before officials were to sit down and sign it.\n\nLegislators in Canada and Mexico must still approve the pact.\n\nTrump had forced Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the 24-year-old agreement because he said it encouraged U.S. companies to move jobs to low-wage Mexico.\n\nU.S. objections to Canada\u2019s protected internal market for dairy products was a major challenge facing negotiators during the talks, and Trump repeatedly demanded concessions and accused Canada of hurting U.S. farmers."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Next Trump-Kim Meeting Likely Early Next Year", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/next-trump-kim-meeting-likely-early-next-year/4683227.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday he is likely to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in January or February and that three sites for their second meeting are under consideration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting along very well.

Microsoft surpassed Apple briefly a few times this week, but didn't close on top until Friday, with a market value of $851 billion to Apple's $847 billion. Microsoft hadn't been at the top since the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.\n\nApple's plunge\n\n\n\nMicrosoft became a contender again in large part because Apple's stock fell nearly 20 percent in November, while Microsoft hasn't done any worse than the rest of the stock market. But the fact that it hasn't done poorly reflects its steady focus on business customers in recent years.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft lost its luster as people were shunning PCs in favor of smartphones. In 2013, PC sales plunged 10 percent to about 315 million, the worst year-to-year drop ever, according to research firms Gartner and IDC. It didn't help that Microsoft's effort to make PCs more like phones, Windows 8, was widely panned.\n\n\n\nBut a turnaround began when the Redmond, Wash., company promoted Nadella as CEO in 2014. He succeeded Microsoft's longtime CEO, Steve Ballmer, who initially scoffed at the notion that people would be willing to pay $500 or more for Apple's iPhones.\n\nThat bet paid off. Windows is now a dwindling fraction of Microsoft's business. While the company still runs consumer-focused businesses such as Bing search and Xbox gaming, it has prioritized business-oriented services such as its Office line of email and other workplace software, as well as newer additions such as LinkedIn and Skype. But its biggest growth has happened in the cloud, particularly the cloud platform it calls Azure. Cloud computing now accounts for more than a quarter of Microsoft's revenue, and Microsoft rivals Amazon as a leading provider of such services.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said Azure is still in its early days, meaning there's plenty of room for growth, especially considering the company's large customer base for Office and other products.\n\n\n\n\"While the tech carnage seen over the last month has been brutal, shares of [Microsoft] continue to hold up like the Rock of Gibraltar,'' he said.\n\n\n\nBeing less reliant on consumer demand helped shield Microsoft from holiday season turbulence and U.S.-China trade war jitters affecting Apple and other tech companies.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump amplified those tariff concerns when he told The Wall Street Journal in a story published late Monday that new tariffs could affect iPhones and laptops imported from China.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone maker had already seen its stock fall after reporting a mixed bag of quarterly results in early November amid fears about how the technology industry will fare in the face of such threats as rising interest rates, increased government regulation and Trump's escalating trade war with China.\n\nReporting change\n\n\n\nApple also spooked investors with an unexpected decision to stop disclosing how many iPhones it sells each quarter. That move has been widely interpreted as a sign that Apple foresees further declines in iPhone sales and is trying to mask that.\n\n\n\nWhile smartphones caused the downturn in personal computers years ago, sales of smartphones themselves have now stalled. That's partly because with fewer innovations from previous models, more people choose to hold on to the devices for longer periods before upgrading.\n\n\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager for Synovus Trust, said Microsoft is outperforming its tech rivals in part because of what it's not. It doesn't face as much regulatory scrutiny as advertising-hungry Google and Facebook, which have attracted controversy over their data-harvesting practices. Unlike Netflix, it's not on a hunt for a diminishing number of international subscribers. And while Amazon also has a strong cloud business, it's still more dependent on online retail."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Rosenstein Calls for Tech Firms to Work With Law Enforcement", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/rosenstein-calls-for-tech-firms-to-work-with-law-enforcement-/4680801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called on social media companies and technology firms Thursday to work with law enforcement to protect the public from cybercriminals.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a symposium on online crime, Rosenstein said that \"social media platforms provide unprecedented opportunities for the free exchange of ideas.

Facebook launched the service in January with six cities and expanded that to 25, then more. On Wednesday, \u201cToday In\u201d is expanding to 400 cities in the U.S. \u2014 and a few others in Australia.\n\nThe move comes as Facebook tries to shake off its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and elections-meddling and rather a place for communities and people to come together and stay informed.\n\nHere are some things to know about this effort, and why it matters:\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt's something users have asked for, the company says. Think of it as an evolution of a \u201ctrending\u201d feature the company dropped earlier this year. That feature, which showed news articles that were popular among users, but was rife with such problems as fake news and accusations of bias.\n\nAnthea Watson Strong, product manager for local news and community information, said her team learned from the problems with that feature.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply the mistakes of our foremothers and forefathers,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time around, Facebook employees went to some of the cities they were launching in and met with users. They tried to predict problems by doing \u201cpre-mortem\u201d assessments, she said. That is, instead of a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d where engineers dissect what went wrong after the fact, they tried to anticipate how people might misuse a feature \u2014 for financial gain, for example.\n\nFacebook isn't saying how long it has been taking this \u201cpre-mortem\u201d approach, though the practice isn't unique to the company. Nonetheless, it's a significant step given that many of Facebook's current problems stem from its failure to foresee how bad actors might co-opt the service.\n\nFacebook also hopes the feature's slow rollout will prevent problems.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo find out if \u201cToday In\u201d is available in your city or town, tap the \u201cmenu\u201d icon with the three horizontal lines. Then scroll down until you see it. If you want, you can choose to see the local updates directly in your news feed.\n\nFor now, the company is offering this only in small and mid-sized cities such as Conroe, Texas, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Large cities such as New York or Los Angeles have added challenges, such as an abundance of news and information, and may need to be broken up into smaller neighborhoods.\n\nThe posts in \u201cToday In\u201d are curated by artificial intelligence; there is no human involvement. The service aggregates posts from the Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. For this reason, a kid couldn't declare a snow day, because \u201cToday In\u201d relies on the school's official page. Discussion posts from local Facebook groups may also be included.\n\nFor now, the information is tailored only by geography, but this might change. A person with no kids, for example, might not want to see updates from schools.\n\nSafeguards?\n\n\n\nFacebook uses software filters to weed out objectionable content, just as it does on people's regular news feed. But the filters are turned up for \u201cToday In.\u201d If a good friend posts something a bit objectionable, you are still likely to see it because Facebook takes your friendship into account. But \u201cToday In\u201d posts aren't coming from your friends, so Facebook is more likely to keep it out.\n\n"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Nigeria\u2019s President Denies Dying And Being Replaced By Lookalike", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nigerias-buhari-denies-dying-and-being-replaced-by-lookalike_us_5c048701e4b0a173c0244298", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s President Buhari on Sunday denied claims that he had died and been replaced by a Sudanese impostor, breaking his silence on a rumor that has circulated on social media for months.\n\nBuhari, who is running for re-election in February, spent five months in Britain last year being treated for an undisclosed illness.

His tour of France\u2019s beloved monument came just hours after he flew back from the G-20 summit in Argentina.\n\nMacron paid tribute to the Unknown Soldier from World War I whose tomb is under the monument. He then headed to a nearby avenue where activists wearing yellow jackets had torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores and battled police on Saturday. There he met with firefighters, police officers and restaurant owners.\n\nParis police said Sunday that 133 people had been injured and 412 had been arrested as protesters trashed the streets of the capital during a demonstration Saturday against rising taxes and the high cost of living.\n\nCharred cars, broken windows and downed fences from the riot littered many of the city\u2019s most popular tourist areas on Sunday, including major avenues near the Arc de Triomphe, streets around the famed Champs-Elysees Avenue, and the Tuileries garden. Graffiti was also sprayed on many stores and buildings.\n\nActivists wearing yellow jackets had torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores, threw rocks at police and tagged the Arc de Triomphe with multi-colored graffiti. French police responded with tear gas and water cannon, closing down dozens of streets and Metro stations as they tried to contain the riot.\n\nPolice said 23 police officers were among the injured and 378 of the arrested have been put in police custody.\n\nBy Sunday morning, Paris city employees were cleaning up the graffiti on the Arc de Triomphe.

The scene in Paris contrasted sharply with protests elsewhere in France on Saturday that were mostly peaceful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to reach the end of the month. People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed up,\u201d said Rabah Mendez, a protester marched peacefully Saturday in Paris.\n\nThe demonstrators say Macron\u2019s government does not care about the problems of ordinary people. The grassroots protests began Nov. 17 with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike but now involve a broad range of demands related to France\u2019s high cost of living.\n\nMacron, speaking in Buenos Aires before he flew home, welcomed the views of the protesters but said there was no place for violence in public discourse."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Israeli Police Recommend Netanyahu Be Charged With Bribery In Telecom Case", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netanyahu-bribery-bezeq_us_5c03d74de4b0606a15b6349f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli police on Sunday recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on bribery charges related to a corruption case involving Israel\u2019s telecom giant, prompting immediate calls for his resignation.\n\nPolice say their investigation has established an evidentiary foundation to charge Netanyahu and his wife Sara with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. The case revolves around suspicions that confidants of Netanyahu promoted regulations worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Bezeq telecom company in exchange for positive coverage of the prime minister on Bezeq\u2019s subsidiary news website, Walla.\n\nPolice have already recommended indicting Netanyahu on corruption charges in two other cases.

Two of his top confidants have turned state witnesses and are believed to have provided police with incriminating evidence. Netanyahu held the government\u2019s communications portfolio until last year and oversaw regulation in the field. Former journalists at the Walla news site have attested to being pressured to refrain from negative reporting of Netanyahu.\n\nPolice say the investigation, which included the testimony of 60 witnesses, revealed that Netanyahu and Bezeq boss Shaul Elovitch engaged in a \u201cbribe-based relationship.\u201d\n\nFrom 2012 to 2017 the prime minister and his associates \u201cblatantly intervened\u201d on a near-daily basis in the Walla news site, using the connections with Elovitch to influence appointments there and to promote flattering articles and pictures while quelling critical stories of the prime minister and his family, police said.\n\nPolice are also recommending charges be brought against Elovitch and members of his family.\n\n\u201cThe most serious bribery case yet leaves no room for doubt: a prime minister who is accused of the most serious offense for a public servant in the Israeli rule book cannot keep serving one minute longer,\u201d said Tamar Zandberg, head of the dovish opposition Meretz party.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has no moral mandate to keep his seat and must resign today.

I\u2019m taking every second in, just absorbing every part of it. I\u2019m just going to savor it. Country music legend Reba McEntire, 2018 Kennedy Center honoree\n\nThe only reference to the president skipping the occasion came indirectly, during host Gloria Estefan\u2019s remembrance of former President George H.W. Bush, who died Friday.\n\nPraising Bush and sharing her personal memories of him, Estefan, a 2017 Kennedy Center honoree, said that he \u201cgraciously attended this event many times during his administration, laughing, applauding, singing along, and even shedding a tear from right up there in that presidential box.\u201d\n\nDuring previous ceremonies, presidents\u2019 personal connections and candid reactions to each year\u2019s group of pop culture legends often became memorable moments, like Aretha Franklin moving President Barack Obama to tears in 2015 during a performance honoring one of that year\u2019s award recipients, Carole King.\n\nHowever, Sunday\u2019s show demonstrated that the president doesn\u2019t need to be there for the occasion to resonate. At the Kennedy Center Honors, the show went off without a hitch, unlike some other cultural traditions that have experienced upheaval in the Trump era.\n\nCase in point: the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, another Washington mainstay now defined by Trump\u2019s absence. There, unlike at the Kennedy Center Honors, the president has typically played a bigger role in the evening\u2019s proceedings by giving a roast of himself, so Trump\u2019s decision to skip it has significantly altered the annual confab.\n\nAfter criticism of comedian Michelle Wolf\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s dinner, the WHCA announced last month that it would scrap the comedy element of the evening altogether. It\u2019s to be replaced by a keynote address from historian Ron Chernow, who attended the Kennedy Center Honors Sunday night because he wrote the biography that inspired the \u201cHamilton\u201d musical.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the red carpet, Chernow declined to describe his plans for next year\u2019s dinner, saying he\u2019s still considering ideas.\n\nKennedy Center President Deborah Rutter said she was certainly \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the Trumps\u2019 declining to attend the ceremony. But for the honorees, the evening is much more about the \u201cregal\u201d atmosphere and being \u201cmoved by the experience of being in these spaces,\u201d she said.\n\nGreg Allen/Invision/AP This year's Kennedy Center honorees.\n\nSunday\u2019s show unfolded as it always does, hitting all the right notes for pop culture lovers as a celebration of the performing arts. There was the usual guessing game of which famous faces would appear on stage for its highly choreographed segments paying tribute to the honorees \u2014 featuring sometimes unlikely pairings, like Paul Simon leading the tribute to Glass.\n\nOther pairings were more expected, like Kelly Clarkson honoring McEntire, her longtime mentor (and former mother-in-law). Clarkson spoke affectionately of McEntire, and like many of the night\u2019s performers, she appeared humbled by the opportunity to put her own spin on the work of one of her heroes.\n\n\u201cI hope you enjoy this song,\u201d Clarkson told McEntire. \u201cDon\u2019t judge me.\u201d\n\nThe night\u2019s final segment was reserved for Cher, befitting the singer\u2019s larger-than-life aura. Whoopi Goldberg set the tone, wearing a glimmering black caftan when she walked on stage to introduce the segment.\n\n\u201cI went in your closet,\u201d Goldberg told the pop diva, before quipping to the audience that \u201cshe wears it better.\u201d\n\nAdam Lambert performed a soulful rendition of Cher\u2019s classic \u201cBelieve,\u201d and Cyndi Lauper brought the audience to their feet with \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d\n\nSpotted in the audience during Lauper\u2019s appearance was another unlikely pairing: World music icon Angelique Kidjo and Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth \u2014 who honored Glass and McEntire, respectively \u2014 got out of their seats and danced, spurring the rest of the crowd to follow suit.\n\nThe unprecedented honor for the creators of \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2015 who received the first ever Kennedy Center prize for a work of art, rather than the traditional lifetime achievement award for an individual artist or group \u2015 also featured an unprecedented performance.\n\nWriter and star Lin-Manuel Miranda and music director Alex Lacamoire became the first Kennedy Center honorees to perform during their own tribute, joining original cast member Chris Jackson on stage for \u201cOne Last Time,\u201d a song from the musical.\n\nExplaining the decision to defy convention and make an entirely new award, Rutter said on the red carpet that \u201cit\u2019s really important to acknowledge great work as it\u2019s happening,\u201d rather than waiting decades to bestow a career achievement prize.\n\nShe expects that future ceremonies may also devote awards to individual works of art, but only in similarly extraordinary cases.\n\nDespite the ubiquity of \u201cHamilton\u201d and its loads of awards \u2014 from Tonys to Grammys to the Pulitzer Prize \u2014 its creators still seem exhilarated by the show\u2019s success and how far they\u2019ve come. To all appearances, they were brimming with joy as they spoke to reporters on the red carpet.\n\nWhen asked about performing a rough cut of the show\u2019s eventual opening number at the White House nearly a decade ago, Miranda lit up with excitement at the memory.\n\n\u201cThe highlight of the day that day, besides the performance, was we split a van with James Earl Jones to the White House. We were like, \u2018If the day ends today, we were in a van with James Earl Jones!\u2019\u201d he told HuffPost before Sunday\u2019s ceremony.\n\nLike the \u201cHamilton\u201d team, McEntire \u2015 no stranger to awards \u2015 acknowledged that getting recognized by the Kennedy Center and joining the pantheon of icons who\u2019ve received the award is nonetheless an entirely different matter.\n\n\u201cThis is a night I\u2019m going to cherish.

Ifill watched the hearings religiously with her family, inspired by the ways in which the South\u2019s first black female representative waxed poetic on her country and criticized its corrupt leader.\n\nAt that time, there was no possible way of knowing just how instructional those moments were.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as though the men in that room looked like they wanted to listen to her,\u201d Ifill recalled. \u201cThey just couldn\u2019t not listen to her.\u201d\n\nIfill is the president and director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF), a role she has held since 2013. She and her associate director-counsel, Janai Nelson, said they remember discovering their passions for civil rights work early in their lives. Ifill was reared in a politically minded family and, as a child, desperately wished she had been alive during the height of the civil rights movement.\n\n\u201cI used to feel like I\u2019d missed it,\u201d she said, seemingly nodding to the similarity between that period and the current one. \u201cI wondered how it could be possible that I wasn\u2019t born at the time of this movement.\u201d\n\nI wondered how it could be possible that I wasn\u2019t born at the time of this movement.

The LDF has been separate from the NAACP since 1957. Its history is abundant in high-profile cases, from Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court ruled against de jure school segregation, to the LDF\u2019s involvement in the Shelby County v. Holder voting rights case, which ultimately resulted in a repeal of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nWhen Marshall died in 1993, Nelson was a freshman at UCLA Law School. Inspired by his legacy, she earned an externship in the LDF\u2019s regional office in Los Angeles shortly after she graduated.\n\nIfill and Nelson work together to allocate the LDF\u2019s resources in support of civil rights protections across the country. The two are seasoned attorneys who frequent the cable news circuit and have taken on public roles as leaders of what is arguably America\u2019s foremost civil rights organization. Both are in their second stint of work with the LDF, after having taken time away to work in academia and raise their children.\n\nBennett Raglin via Getty Images Ifill and Nelson at the 2018 NAACP LDF Equal Justice Awards Dinner, Nov. 1 in New York.

I weaned my eldest daughter to argue my first appellate case.\u201d\n\nShe credits the experience for inspiring her brand of leadership \u2015 one that places emphasis on family time and a healthy home life. And it\u2019s clear that Ifill\u2019s and Nelson\u2019s intersections \u2015 as black women who are also mothers \u2015 factor in their legal agenda or at least enhance their perspective on the difficulties endured by Americans of various identities.\n\nAnd with the breadth and depth of issues the LDF addresses, the contours of American democracy could very well be shaped by the group\u2019s handiwork, particularly when it comes to opposing an administration committed to rolling back civil rights protections.\n\nHuffPost In 2017 the NAACP LDF sued President Donald Trump, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, accusing it of voter suppression efforts. The panel disbanded soon afterward.\n\nWith this administration, it\u2019s like drinking out of a firehose. Ifill\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve only sued a president once before in the nearly 80-year history of the organization,\u201d Ifill said. \u201cWe sued Ben Carson. We sued Betsy DeVos. This is not normal, and it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve changed.\u201d\n\nSimply, the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of civil rights protections is more systemic and is farther-reaching than prior administrations\u2019.\n\n\u201cWith this administration, it\u2019s like drinking out of a firehose,\u201d Ifill said. \u201cThis is a very aggressive administration, and with many of the actions it\u2019s taken, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s been stretching all of us.\u201d\n\nNelson said they are worried not just about new threats to civil rights but also about maintaining the fight against those that existed long before this administration.\n\n\u201cThe things we\u2019ve been working on for years cannot just be cast aside in order to respond to every antic coming out of the White House,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that ensuring access to clean water and efficient transportation, for example, are initiatives the organization has pursued for years and that making progress in those areas requires prioritizing and making tough decisions about the most pressing threats coming from the administration.\n\nNo win has come easy. No win has come fast. Sherrilyn Ifill, President, NAACP LDF\n\nThat concern about attrition takes on added meaning, though, during a time when the threats to civil rights are ubiquitous.

(AP) \u2014 An insurgent underdog no more, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is laying the groundwork to launch a bigger presidential campaign than his first, as advisers predict he would open the 2020 Democratic presidential primary season as a political powerhouse.\n\nA final decision has not been made, but those closest to the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist suggest that neither age nor interest from a glut of progressive presidential prospects would dissuade him from undertaking a second shot at the presidency. And as Sanders\u2019 brain trust gathered for a retreat in Vermont over the weekend, some spoke openly about a 2020 White House bid as if it was almost a foregone conclusion.\n\n\u201cThis time, he starts off as a front-runner, or one of the front-runners,\u201d Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign manager John Weaver told The Associated Press, highlighting the senator\u2019s proven ability to generate massive fundraising through small-dollar donations and his ready-made network of staff and volunteers.\n\nWeaver added: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a much bigger campaign if he runs again, in terms of the size of the operation.\u201d\n\nAmid the enthusiasm \u2014 and there was plenty in Burlington as the Sanders Institute convened his celebrity supporters, former campaign staff and progressive policy leaders \u2014 there were also signs of cracks in Sanders\u2019 political base. His loyalists are sizing up a prospective 2020 Democratic field likely to feature a collection of ambitious liberal leaders \u2014 and not the establishment-minded Hillary Clinton.\n\nInstead, a new generation of outspoken Democrats such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris are expected to seek the Democratic nomination. All three have embraced Sanders\u2019 call for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a $15 minimum wage, among other policy priorities he helped bring into the Democratic mainstream in the Trump era.\n\nAcknowledging the stark differences between the 2016 and 2020 fields, Hollywood star Danny Glover, who campaigned alongside Sanders in 2016, would not commit to a second Sanders\u2019 candidacy when asked this weekend.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what 2020 looks like right now,\u201d Glover said before taking a front-row seat for Sanders\u2019 opening remarks. \u201cI\u2019m going to support who I feel to be the most progressive choice.\u201d\n\nOne of Sanders\u2019 chief supporters from neighboring New Hampshire, former state senate majority leader Burt Cohen, acknowledged that some people worry Sanders is too old for a second run, although that\u2019s not a major concern of his. Like Glover, he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll join Sanders a second time.\n\n\u201cThere are other people picking up the flag and holding it high, and you know, it could be Bernie, but I think there are other people as well,\u201d said Cohen, who did not attend the Vermont summit. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Bernie or bust.\u2019 That\u2019s certainly not the case.\u201d\n\nAnother high-profile Sanders supporter who was in attendance, Cornel West, described the Vermont senator as \u201cthe most consistently progressive one out there,\u201d suggesting that some would-be 2020 candidates have adopted Sanders\u2019 words, but maintained ties to Wall Street and \u201cmilitarism.\u201d\n\nStill, West conceded that none of likely 2020 candidates \u201chave as much baggage\u201d as Clinton did.\n\nPerhaps the most important member of Sanders\u2019 network, wife Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, said Democrats may be embracing Sanders\u2019 \u201cbold progressive ideas\u201d on health care and the economy in some cases, but there\u2019s need to go further on issues like climate change, affordable housing and student debt.\n\nWhether her husband will lead the debate as a presidential candidate in 2020, she said, remains unclear. O\u2019Meara Sanders noted that one question above all others would guide their decision: \u201cWho can beat Donald Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has to be the primary goal. To win. We think you win by a very strong progressive commitment,\u201d she told AP. When asked if Sanders could win in 2020, she said \u201cevery single poll\u201d showed that Sanders would have beaten Republican nominee Donald Trump two years ago.\n\nO\u2019Meara Sanders also downplayed the grueling personal demands of a presidential campaign, something that historically has led some other spouses to pressure their husbands to avoid the white-hot presidential spotlight more than once.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely inspiring meeting all the people all over the country,\u201d she said of the 2016 campaign. \u201cAnd what might be difficult for me is not as important as what might be difficult for them and whether or not we can help them with those difficulties.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about us,\u201d O\u2019Meara Sanders added. \u201cIt\u2019s about what\u2019s right for the country.\u201d\n\nDespite signs pointing to a 2020 run, Sanders has given himself a clear escape hatch.\n\nWeaver, like Sanders himself in a recent interview, suggested that the senator would step aside if he believes another candidate has a better shot at denying Trump a second term. There are no clear indications from Sanders or those closest to him, however, that he currently has that belief.\n\n\u201cI know they haven\u2019t announced, but it sort of seems like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d said John Cusack, another actor invited to the weekend summit. Asked about his preference for 2020, he called Sanders \u201cthe only real progressive candidate out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the sudden, what was once fringe politics is now mainstream.

The move comes 10 years after voters approved marijuana to alleviate the effects of certain illnesses. Many supporters believe that decadelong experience, as well as similar legalization efforts in other states, led to victory at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to smell like freedom,\u201d starting Thursday, said Detroit lawyer Matt Abel, who specializes in marijuana law and whose office sign says, \u201ccannabis counsel.\u201d\n\nEleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. Of course, there are many caveats in Michigan and already some tension.\n\nHOW MUCH?\n\nMichigan residents who are 21 or older can possess or transport up to 2.5 ounces (70.8 grams) of marijuana. They can grow up to 12 plants, although not in public view. They also can give 2.5 ounces (70.8 grams) to another person, but not for payment.\n\nBUZZ ZONES\n\nMarijuana can be consumed only at homes or other private property, although landlords and employers can prohibit it. It can\u2019t be smoked at bars or restaurants or any other place that is accessible to the public. That means getting high while walking the dog or hustling between college classes could lead to trouble.\n\nMichigan colleges and universities have repeatedly stated that campus anti-drug policies won\u2019t change. Employers will still be able to fire people for drug use.\n\nPOT SHOPS\n\nThe doors are not open yet. The new law creates a system of growing and selling marijuana, with millions of dollars to be collected in taxes, but those shops still are months away and must involve state regulators. So people who want marijuana now will need to grow it or obtain it by other, perhaps illegal, means.\n\nMichigan is just beginning to license medical-marijuana dispensaries.

Millionaires comprise nearly 40 percent of Congress, compared to being just 4 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nThis lopsided representation is not just some coincidence.\n\nRich people have a significant advantage running for office in a political system that relies on private donations. Rich people have rich friends who can donate to their campaign. They have the resources to make sure everything is taken care of in their personal life so that they can focus all their attention on running for office. And they can fund their own campaign and not worry about spending all their time raising money.\n\n\u201cThe notion of being able to just write a check for that much to help pay for ads and such \u2015 that would be completely out of my abilities,\u201d said Shawna Roberts, who quit her part-time job at McDonald\u2019s to run as the Democratic candidate in Ohio\u2019s 6th congressional district.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd to imagine people who don\u2019t have deep pockets doing it on their own,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd yet, it\u2019s one of the things that we have to do if we\u2019re going to have an actual democracy that actually functions instead of what we have right now, which is an oligarchy without the name.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 elections saw a surge of first-time candidates running for office. It was the most diverse field in history. But financially, many of these candidates found it tough to make ends meet.\n\nI had the same pair of dress shoes that I used for canvassing and events, because while appearance is important, I have kids to take care of. I was losing money every month. Kerri Harris, Democratic Senate candidate in Delaware\n\nFederal campaign laws allow candidates to give themselves a salary, up to how much they would be paid if they were elected or what they made in the previous year \u2015 whichever amount is lower.\n\nBrendan Fischer, director of federal reform for the Campaign Legal Center, said that most candidates don\u2019t take the salary \u2015 even though some of them probably should. Many candidates are wealthy and don\u2019t need the money, and the ones who aren\u2019t are often reluctant to take a salary because it might not look good politically.\n\n\u201cWe want candidates from diverse backgrounds to run for office, and if they need to pay themselves a salary to do so, that\u2019s entirely permissible and the law allows for it,\u201d he said.\n\nFischer said candidates are also allowed to use campaign funds for child care, but only if the candidate was a stay-at-home parent previously and now has child care expenses that exist only because of the run for office.\n\nKerri Harris ran a long shot, progressive, grassroots campaign to unseat Sen. Tom Carper in the Delaware Democratic primary. She had just five paid staffers, and said she couldn\u2019t justify \u201ctaking for myself when there were people who were working just as hard taking nothing.\u201d\n\nHarris, who has two young children, receives veterans disability benefits. (She served in the Air Force.) But she gave up her other source of income \u2015 organizing work \u2015 when she launched the campaign, because she didn\u2019t want it to be seen as a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cBy summer I was losing about $1,600 a month, which was very painful,\u201d said Harris, whose primary was Sept. 6. \u201cI don\u2019t make a lot of money as it is. ... It was stressful. It was an added stress on top of the stress of campaigning.\u201d\n\nFederal election laws also don\u2019t allow candidates to pay for personal items of clothing. So Harris made do with one pair of dress pants for the campaign \u2015 and the day of her debate against Carper, in late August, her pants suddenly had a hole in them.\n\n\u201cThat morning, I was able to afford a blazer,\u201d she recounted. \u201cI called up a campaign supporter and said, \u2018Hey, can you hem it?\u2019 So she\u2019s hemming up my jacket and I\u2019m sewing the crotch of my pants before I go onstage. ... I had the same pair of dress shoes that I used for canvassing and the events because while appearance is important, I have kids to take care of. I was losing money every month. I still had to put money into the campaign because there were things that the campaign needed.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 Ohio run began with her local Indivisible chapter, a progressive advocacy group. She and her fellow Democrats decided someone needed to run against the incumbent, Rep. Bill Johnson (R), so that he\u2019d at least have a challenge \u2015 even though the district is heavily Republican.\n\n\u201cYou have to say to yourself, \u2018Can I afford to not have cash coming in?\u2019 And we were lucky we did,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a couple of weeks there, when I was running, that things were a little tight. But you know, we made it.\u201d\n\nRoberts and her husband ran a beekeeping business, but when the recession hit, people no longer had money to buy items like beeswax candles and honey. Her husband took a job as a commercial truck driver, and she took a part-time job at McDonald\u2019s across the street from her kids\u2019 school (she has five children, ages 14-21) so she could be around for them.\n\nRoberts said she was lucky that she had a little extra money saved up to get them through the campaign. She didn\u2019t take a salary because she simply wasn\u2019t raising enough to do so, and it was more important to pay the bills and expenses for the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a terrible fundraiser, and I knew this about myself going in,\u201d she said, noting that she never is able to sell popcorn or magazines when her children need help with school fundraisers.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the national phenomenon from New York who is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, did pay herself a salary \u2015 but only $6,000. Ocasio-Cortez, in many ways, was one of the lucky ones, because she won and will now have a job.\n\nBut she reportedly now has less than $7,000 in her bank account, and she told The New York Times that she\u2019s not sure how she\u2019ll be able to afford an apartment in Washington, D.C. \u2015 especially because she won\u2019t be making any money until the new Congress convenes in January.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was also dinged by a media writer who tweeted a picture of her wearing a suit, saying she really didn\u2019t look all that poor.\n\nAh yes. @eScarry deleted it, but here it is. She seems appropriately dressed for her new gig as a Congressperson to me. https://t.co/n30ERg91s7 \u2014 Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) November 16, 2018\n\nIn other words, if you look nice, you could look too nice. But if you don\u2019t look nice, you might not look professional enough to seem like you should be elected. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\n\nAnd, by the way, a friend gave Ocasio-Cortez a subscription to Rent the Runway, meaning that many of her nicer outfits are likely rented.\n\nEven people who have political experience find it hard to raise the money needed to run for office if they don\u2019t come from wealth or have those networks available to them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this whole underlying power structure that exists around a candidacy that I didn\u2019t know about \u2014 the people who you\u2019ve got to talk to, to let them know you\u2019re running, so they can help you cast a wider net. I needed help navigating that stratosphere,\u201d said Deidre DeJear, who ran as the Democratic nominee for secretary of state in Iowa. She lost in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally like being a first-generation college student,\u201d she added. \u201cYou need a village to help you grasp the intricacies of it, the invisible rules. When you don\u2019t have people in your life who\u2019ve done that before, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d\n\nDeJear felt her lack of personal wealth and connections hurt donors\u2019 perceptions of her chances. When Democratic stalwarts did give to her, they often donated less than they had in previous years to candidates for the same office.\n\n\u201cI had to spend a great deal of time with them, reminding them this race is not different than it was in 2014 \u2015 just because I\u2019m a black woman doesn\u2019t make the race any cheaper than it was in 2014,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a challenge to get funders in the mindset of contributing to a woman who had no polling, no resources, who had never run before.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Kerri Harris ran against Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) in the Democratic primary this cycle.\n\nRoberts is again working at McDonald\u2019s, since her manager agreed to let her return to her old job. She said she\u2019s sick and tired of hearing about politicians who talk about how they were raised poor \u2015 when they\u2019re now millionaires. Government needs to have more people from lower-income levels, she said.\n\n\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so I know what it\u2019s like to be raised as a kid without a lot of money. But I also know what it\u2019s like to be trying to raise kids without a lot of money, and it\u2019s a very different perspective,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cGovernment affects everything you do.\u201d\n\nAfter the campaign, Harris sent an email to her supporters, asking them to help her pay off her campaign debt. Candidates send these notes out all the time, but Harris was more open and transparent about her need for assistance and the rigged system in place:\n\nBut one of the biggest lessons I learned on this campaign was this: the system is absolutely, positively set up for the rich to run for office in America, while the rest of us are expected to follow their lead even if they aren\u2019t representing our best interests. And that is completely messed up. Following the campaign, I spent my time continuing to fight for all of the solutions we collectively fought for, but as I was fighting, campaign bills kept rolling in. After working to whittle it down, I\u2019ve managed to retire much of it. But I\u2019m still $14,000 in the red. Is it any wonder only millionaires run for office? The rest of us can\u2019t afford to.\n\nHarris isn\u2019t sure where she\u2019ll go next. She\u2019s writing a book for Strong Arm Press (whose publisher, Ryan Grim, previously worked at HuffPost), she still receives disability benefits and she occasionally gets an honorarium for speaking events (although she never demands one). She\u2019s also reluctant to take a traditional 9-5 job, since she wants to make sure she continues to help organize and advocate for the positions she ran on.\n\nHarris said she remembers a volunteer coming up to her on the night of her loss, saying that people like her \u2015 and what the Harris campaign represented \u2015 need more than a voice. They need power.\n\n\u201cWe built something,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf I quit and run off and say it\u2019s just easier to find another type of paid position, the brokenness she felt that night will be confirmed as opposed to me saying, \u2018Look at what we did.\u2019 Even though there are days when where I literally tear up like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, and I get worried if I\u2019m making the right decision for my children and stuff, by the end of the day, I\u2019m ready to fight the next morning.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Said China Is Now Open To Qualcomm-NXP Deal.

Ironically, I wound up suffocating and feeling hungry for air every minute of every day for the next 20 years. Instead of helping, the procedure caused horrific and ever-worsening complications \u2015 a cycle of insidious misery that I feared I would not escape until I drew my last dull, stifling, unsatisfying breath.\n\nImagine finding that an integral part of your nervous system had been hacked away by your trusted doctor without warning, with no pre-surgical notice or discussion of the attendant, potentially life-altering risks. This may seem like the premise of a horror film. But to victims of this tragedy, this enduring, unending terror is real life. And it\u2019s inescapable.\n\nThis is empty nose syndrome, or ENS, though it should be called nasal post-operative suffocation syndrome because that\u2019s what it is: a totally avoidable, physician-induced deformity resulting in an as-of-yet incurable and debilitating condition.\n\nDuring my initial surgery, my turbinates \u2015 what I\u2019ve learned are small but essential organs that sense airflow and signal your brain as to whether you\u2019re breathing \u2015 had been irreversibly damaged. Doctors, including accredited ear, nose and throat surgeons who should have known better but didn\u2019t \u2015 severed vital nerves that were critical to ensuring the proper function of my autonomic nervous system, which governs involuntary functions such as breathing, heartbeat and temperature control. My life, like those of untold numbers of similar victims across the world, would never be the same.\n\nImmediately after my procedure, I experienced a lack of air resistance when breathing and speaking, making these activities that ordinarily came naturally and effortlessly entirely exhausting. I needed to exert great effort simply to project my voice, and for decades I had to catch my breath after speaking just five or six words. I learned how much we take for granted when we\u2019re automatically calibrated to breathe smoothly and fluidly while speaking.\n\nAlthough I was in fact breathing and getting oxygen, my brain was no longer made aware of it, so it communicated to my body that it was suffocating, triggering an unremitting fight/flight response \u2015 a constant state of alert, as if an unseen danger was always imminent.\n\nAlthough I was in fact breathing and getting oxygen, my brain was no longer made aware of it, so it communicated to my body that it was suffocating, triggering an unremitting fight/flight response \u2015 a constant state of alert, as if an unseen danger was always imminent. Living in an unrelenting panic state is highly unnatural. The body is trained to fight or flee quickly, to flush our systems with extra cortisol and adrenaline until we\u2019re safe and our hormonal systems can resume normal balance. But chronic cortisol release is exceedingly damaging to body tissues, and it drastically damaged my nervous system.\n\nAlong with not sensing myself breathing during the day, and my resulting constant state of anxiety, my brain, perceiving suffocation, woke me up every night by generating nightmares when I drifted off. I began experiencing drenching night sweats, forcing me to change my soaking night clothes and bedding two to three times each night. My brain also signaled my stomach to churn, stimulating fierce acid reflux that burned my throat. I began to try to sleep upright in a reclining chair. I was barely 30.\n\nThe suffering didn\u2019t end there: dehydration, dry eyes, ear and facial pain, and the jarring sensation of cold air piercing my lungs whenever I was in an unheated area were miserable, yet mere nuisances compared to the agony of never being allowed to enter into the deeper, restorative levels of sleep \u2015 a torment that\u2019s been used as a torture tactic in war.\n\nStill, there was more: Restlessness and simultaneously feeling exhausted yet wired. Unable to focus or articulate. Not sensing air all day, hyperventilating. The brain shocking the body day and night in a desperate attempt to escape the misperception of suffocation. The continuous coursing of stress hormones catabolizing the body, breaking down precious tissues. Constant, agonizing fear.\n\nSadly, ENS is purely iatrogenic \u2015 caused by medical intervention \u2015 and it\u2019s a dangerous risk to any one of the hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who undergo elective nasal or sinus procedures where turbinate reduction is performed. Turbinates are essential to our well-being, yet many doctors licensed to practice sinus surgery are shockingly ignorant of the role they play and the danger inherent in carving them away.\n\nThe ever-present agony has been described by some victims as 'life worse than death.' Many have said they\u2019d rather have died or become paraplegics than live with ENS.\n\nThe horrific symptoms of ENS can present the moment you wake from surgery or can emerge slowly as nerves die over time, which can take weeks, months or even years. The inevitable unrelenting panic state that is beyond the victim\u2019s conscious control wears on the mind in many ways while it slowly disintegrates the body, as stress hormones \u2015 the death chemicals \u2015 wreak havoc on every organ system.\n\nOnce debilitated by ENS, many have lost their jobs, their homes, their marriages, their families and their independence. For those who develop disabilities, there\u2019s no recourse. Medical science\u2019s unwillingness to recognize ENS as a valid diagnosis makes suing the surgeons largely nonviable, and the typically delayed onset of ENS\u2019s most devastating symptoms places victims\u2019 cases outside of many states\u2019 short one- to two-year statutes of limitations for medical malpractice cases. Tragically, those who end up disabled and unable to work are left with no source of income.\n\nThen there are the suicides. Too many afflicted patients have ended their own lives, having been pushed over the edge not only by the endless suffocation but also by doctors\u2019 ignorance of their condition and dismissal of it as a psychiatric condition as opposed to a legitimate disorder with an identifiable, discrete set of symptoms with little hope of a cure. The ever-present agony has been described by some victims as \u201clife worse than death.\u201d Many have said they\u2019d rather have died or become paraplegics than live with ENS.\n\nThe disheartening truth is that ENTs were being warned of the risk but chose to dismiss the suffering of victims, some even ridiculing their suffocating patients as having \u201cempty head syndrome.\u201d As early as the 1920s, surgeons were imploring others not to remove people\u2019s turbinates because they had observed the devastation some patients suffered following the procedure. In the early 1990s, when the phrase \u201cempty nose syndrome\u201d was coined, a medical scholar once again warned the ENT community about the condition because he had found a high suicide rate among his own patients who had undergone nasal surgery.\n\nIt is time for the medical establishment to reckon with the truth that thousands of people around the world on every inhabited continent who report the same symptoms have one common thread running through the fabric of their medical history: nasal surgery.\n\nOrgans generally are not removed or reduced without full knowledge of the consequences. We know that people can live normally with one kidney or 35 percent of their liver. But no study has even sought to determine how much turbinate tissue can be removed safely while enabling the patient to maintain proper respiratory function.\n\nSurely, if death were an associated risk of turbinate reduction it would be disclosed. Yet no requirement compels ENTs to disclose the risk of living a \u201clife worse than death,\u201d or to obtain informed patient consent acknowledging the risk of ENS when undergoing nasal surgery, leaving patients unaware that they\u2019re entering a lottery they don\u2019t want to win.\n\nI took for granted that my body had been designed to operate on automatic until I was forced into manual operation.\n\nFor me, receiving a proper diagnosis was an uphill battle that spanned more than 15 years. Because the medical community offered no solutions, I turned to ancient Eastern thought systems to learn how to influence my central nervous system and endocrine system. I discovered ayurveda and followed the principles set forth by the sages. I learned how to eat, what to eat and when to eat to keep cortisol levels low. I embraced yoga and meditation with consciously controlled breathing during my waking hours. But still, I could not influence my breath once asleep. I learned to sleep in segments. I needed to monitor my internal environment and modulate my external environment for things like temperature and humidity. Above all, I had to mitigate stress.\n\nThrough the years and with these practices, I managed to improve significantly and I reclaimed much of what I had lost in my life. None of this was a cure, of course, but without conscious management of my body, I would not have survived. I took for granted that my body had been designed to operate on automatic until I was forced into manual operation.\n\nToday, more than 20 years and thousands of harmful surgeries too late \u2015 mine included \u2015 there are finally four pioneering North American doctors treating this disorder: Dr. Subinoy Das at the U.S. Institute for Advanced Sinus Care and Research in Ohio, Dr. Steven Houser at MetroHealth in Ohio, Dr. Jayakar Nayak at Stanford Health Care in California, and Dr. Andrew Thamboo at St. Paul\u2019s Sinus Centre in Canada.\n\nWhile some patients experience improvement from these often painful and expensive procedures, nothing yet cures ENS or fully restores sufferers to their previous levels of health. For some, their suffocation remains unrelenting. And because a diagnosis code for ENS does not yet exist, insurance companies will not cover these new treatment options, making them inaccessible for most ENS sufferers. A diagnostic code, and more research funding, are desperately needed to help not only existing sufferers but the new victims being afflicted every day all around the globe.\n\nIn April of this year, I sought treatment with Das. He used a cutting-edge tissue regenerative therapy and I have had good results; an increase in volume and air resistance and my facial nerve pain has resolved. While I still suffer from intermittent suffocation, my overall functioning has improved, and I am able finally to sleep more deeply most nights.\n\nToday I\u2019m taking life one breath at a time.\n\nBarbara Schmidt is a New Jersey-based writer, practitioner of holistic medicine and an advocate for health care justice and reform.

The move comes 10 years after voters approved marijuana to alleviate the effects of certain illnesses. Many supporters believe that decadelong experience, as well as similar legalization efforts in other states, led to victory at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to smell like freedom,\u201d starting Thursday, said Detroit lawyer Matt Abel, who specializes in marijuana law and whose office sign says, \u201ccannabis counsel.\u201d\n\nEleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. Of course, there are many caveats in Michigan and already some tension.\n\nHOW MUCH?\n\nMichigan residents who are 21 or older can possess or transport up to 2.5 ounces (70.8 grams) of marijuana. They can grow up to 12 plants, although not in public view. They also can give 2.5 ounces (70.8 grams) to another person, but not for payment.\n\nBUZZ ZONES\n\nMarijuana can be consumed only at homes or other private property, although landlords and employers can prohibit it. It can\u2019t be smoked at bars or restaurants or any other place that is accessible to the public. That means getting high while walking the dog or hustling between college classes could lead to trouble.\n\nMichigan colleges and universities have repeatedly stated that campus anti-drug policies won\u2019t change. Employers will still be able to fire people for drug use.\n\nPOT SHOPS\n\nThe doors are not open yet. The new law creates a system of growing and selling marijuana, with millions of dollars to be collected in taxes, but those shops still are months away and must involve state regulators.

But experts agree the country has the tools to finally end the epidemic at home by 2025.\n\n\u201cOur national HIV strategy to this point has actually not called for an end to the epidemic,\u201d William McColl, vice president for policy and advocacy for AIDS United, told HuffPost.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what McColl and other public health advocates are doing. AIDS United spearheaded a report, along with more than 250 other organizations, outlining a plan for Congress to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to reduce HIV incidence and mortality. \u201cRight now we have a historic opportunity\u201d to put an end to the epidemic in the U.S., McColl said.\n\nThe roadmap for collective national response to the HIV epidemic, released Friday, on the eve of World AIDS Day, calls on Congress to enact legislation and allocate resources to achieve what the report calls a 95/95/95 framework for HIV care: ensuring that 95 percent of people living with HIV receive a diagnosis, 95 percent of people diagnosed with HIV receive treatment, and 95 percent of those in treatment become undetectable, or unable to pass on the virus, through antiretroviral therapy.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re able to implement this 95/95/95 cure framework with 40 percent PrEP coverage, we know that we can reduce the number of new HIV cases during the years 2019 to 2030 by nearly 353,000 people,\u201d McColl said.\n\nPrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a once-daily oral pill that reduces a person\u2019s risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact by more than 90 percent.\n\nWhile experts and advocates are confident it can be done, they agree that one of the biggest challenges for the country will be addressing higher rates of HIV among communities of color, particularly LGBTQ communities of color, which are disproportionately impacted by the virus.\n\n\u201c[If] we don\u2019t address the specific disparities for African American and Latinx populations, in particular, it\u2019s going to be more difficult for us to end the epidemic any time soon. Sable Nelson, a policy analyst for National Minority AIDS Council.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t bridge those gaps and we don\u2019t address the specific disparities for African American and Latinx populations, in particular, it\u2019s going to be more difficult for us to end the epidemic any time soon,\u201d Sable Nelson, a policy analyst for National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC), one of the organizations endorsing the report, told HuffPost.\n\nPutting Marginalized Communities At The Center\n\n\u201cSocial and economic marginalization leaves certain communities to bear the brunt of the U.S. epidemic,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said, adding that poverty, racism, sexism and homophobia also influence the likelihood of HIV exposure. Eliminating health disparities is a crucial part of the report\u2019s six-pillar plan.\n\nIn 2017, black Americans made up 43 percent and Latinxs made up 26 percent of all new HIV diagnoses nationally \u2015 with black queer men being most affected overall. Similarly, cisgender black and Latinx women are at higher risk of contracting HIV compared to their white counterparts.\n\nDespite being at higher risk, black and Latinx are less likely than white Americans to use preventive measures like PrEP. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released in March found that while half of the 1.1. million Americans who could benefit from PrEP were black, only 1 percent of people filling PrEP prescriptions were black Americans.\n\nSocial and economic marginalization leaves certain communities to bear the brunt of the U.S. epidemic. A new report on ending the HIV epidemic\n\n\u201cThe challenge is getting drugs to people who need them \u2015 whether it\u2019s drugs for prevention or treatment \u2015 and [the root of those] challenges range from resource issues to disparity and stigma issues,\u201d McColl said.\n\nTo close these gaps, the report suggests \u2015 among other policies \u2015 expanding Medicaid and other federal health programs to ensure equitable access to effective HIV prevention and treatment.\n\nBut Nelson said it\u2019s not enough to take a top-down approach; she insists the solution to the problem will come with both federal and grassroots efforts working collectively to reach vulnerable communities.\n\n\u2018Meeting People On Their Terms\u2019\n\nDr. Andrew Goodman, associate director of medicine at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, an organization dedicated to serving the LGBTQ community, told HuffPost that the structural racism present in health care represents a major barrier to care for many people of color.\n\n\u201cHistorically we\u2019ve had a health care system that I think as much as it has wanted to help people, has probably traumatized people,\u201d Goodman, an HIV specialist who was not part of the new report, said. And \u201cpart of our challenge is that we are one agency functioning in a health care system and culture that is just structurally racist and biased at its core.\u201d\n\nStigma is also a big obstacle. \u201cI know in spite of all the success that we\u2019ve had with HIV treatment at this point in 2018, a lot of people still carry a lot of stigma and shame around with them around their own status or feel that from their community,\u201d he adds. This keeps people from seeking testing, treatment and prevention options.\n\nBreaking down these barriers, Goodman said, means being mindful about the physical locations of health services and creating outreach programs and interventions that are authentic and affirming.\n\nFor example, Callen-Lorde\u2019s primary location is based in Chelsea, an LGBTQ-friendly Manhattan neighborhood that is overwhelmingly white. But in 2016, the nonprofit opened a location in the South Bronx, and it is planning another in Brooklyn to reach more communities of color.\n\nAnd Goodman said the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has been instrumental in lowering HIV stigma by implementing sex-positive public health campaigns to normalize and raise awareness about PrEP among HIV-negative individuals. Several campaigns, including subway and bus ads, have been designed specifically to reach women of color and Latinxs.\n\nOn Thursday, the department announced that new HIV diagnoses in New York City had reached an all-time low for the second year in a row \u2015 dropping 5.4 percent from 2016 to 2017.\n\nDr. Demetre Daskalakis, the department\u2019s deputy commissioner for disease control, told HuffPost addressing health disparities among communities of color was crucial to achieving decreases in new HIV cases across all races.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the fact that being sex-positive, being person-focused and really trying to meet people on their terms changes an epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nNelson applauded New York City for their progress, particularly their work in breaking down stigma, but pointed out that many strategies that work for urban cities can\u2019t always be successfully implemented in rural or suburban areas.\n\nNo one should be dying from AIDS anymore. The science and the medicine is at a place where that does not have to happen. Dr. Andrew Goodman, HIV specialist at Callen Lorde\n\n\u201cNew York has incredible resources, they have incredible advocates...[and] it\u2019s difficult to replicate what happens in New York in other states and other regions across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different playing field in rural and southern areas, and you have to adapt your model for where you\u2019re trying to provide those services.\u201d\n\nNelson said stigma is compounded in rural and suburban areas, where people are afraid to be seen going to centers dedicated to HIV treatment. In these cases, National Minority AIDS Council has found that telehealth programs \u2015 through which remote patients can connect with providers via video chat \u2015 have been effective in engaging people in HIV care and retaining those with an HIV diagnosis in treatment.\n\nDaskalakis agrees that the New York City model is not easily translated to those regions, but some lessons can certainly be applied to rural areas. This includes New York City\u2019s move to introduce PrEP in sexual health clinics and combine HIV testing, treatment and prevention efforts \u2015 so that individuals who test positive for HIV will be directed to treatment and those who test negative will be offered a prescription for PrEP.\n\n\u201cWhat we were seeing is that the very people that were accessing our clinics every day were the exact people that folks say are hard to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cSo rather than recreating the wheel and trying to have them come to PrEP, we brought PrEP to them.\u201d\n\nFor Goodman, it\u2019s these interventions that cement his belief that ending the epidemic is not only achievable but well within reach with the appropriate resources and legislative support."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Elon Musk Ducks Out Of One Los Angeles Tunnel But Pursues Another", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-los-angeles-tunnel_us_5bffb16ae4b0850623199de0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That translates into lower reproductive rates and lower rates of survival. And once you put those two together, it's just a matter of time before the population abundance declines.\n\nDoes the decline of sea ice also affect where female bears make their dens?\n\nPolar bears do den offshore, on ice that has to be relatively thick and have snow on top of it. So that tends to be ice that\u2019s more than one year old. Multiyear ice is already disappearing, and if you look at the projections, it will continue to disappear.
