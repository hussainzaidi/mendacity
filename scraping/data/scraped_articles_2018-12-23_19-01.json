View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Few who work at senior levels in the administration of President Donald Trump leave with their reputations unsullied. Even fewer leave on their own terms.\n\nJim Mattis is one of the few.\n\nIn the wake of Mattis' resignation as defense secretary Thursday, it's worth recalling that the relationship between Trump and Mattis started well. Mattis met Trump for the first time at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey in mid-November 2016 to talk with the President-elect about the Secretary of Defense job.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump came out to talk to the press. Framed by the imposing, white columns of his Bedminster estate, Trump posed for pictures with Mattis.\n\nReporters shouted questions at Trump about whether Mattis was being considered for a cabinet job. Trump replied , \"He's just a brilliant, wonderful man. What a career! We're going to see what happens, but he is the real deal.\"\n\nDuring Mattis' first interview as Secretary of Defense on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" host John Dickerson asked Mattis, \"What keeps you awake at night?\"\n\nWithout missing a beat, Mattis replied , \"Nothing. I keep other people awake at night.\"\n\nBromance over burgers\n\nTrump loves this kind of smack and, before their bromance faded, he would invite Mattis to the White House to eat a casual dinner of burgers and to shoot the breeze about the state of the world.\n\nIn picking Mattis to be his Secretary of Defense , Trump said he had found his \"Gen. George Patton.\" Because of his ferocity on the battlefield, Mattis is nicknamed \"Mad Dog,\" a moniker Trump rejoiced in but Mattis himself doesn't love.\n\nMattis is also a \"warrior monk.\" An American four-star general is likely to move a dozen times during a long career, bringing family and household effects from one post to the next. Gen. Mattis, who has never married, instead moved his books \u2014 all 7,000 of them.\n\nIn 2003 during the Iraq War, Mattis explained in an email to a fellow officer why deep reading about the history of warfare can save American lives on the battlefield. \"By reading, you learn through others' experience \u2014 generally a better way to do business \u2014 especially in our line of work where the consequences of incompetence are so final for young men,\" he wrote.\n\nBy contrast, Trump reads little except, perhaps, hagiographic works by his most hardcore supporters.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump said he received information about military affairs from \"the shows\" on TV. Fox News continues to be a key briefing source.\n\nBut the differences between Trump and Mattis go far beyond their preferred means of absorbing information. The break between Mattis and Trump represents the most consequential split between those in the Trump administration who value US international alliances and commitments and those, like Trump, who do not.\n\nOf course, others went before Mattis. Trump's former national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, understood American alliances and commitments, having served alongside allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also led the fight within the administration not to pull all US troops out of Afghanistan, which was Trump's first instinct.\n\nThe break between Mattis and Trump represents the most consequential split between those in the Trump administration who value the United States' international alliances and commitments and those, like Trump, who do not. Peter Bergen\n\nBut Mattis is the longest-serving senior cabinet official to leave the administration, and he is resigning on principle, in particular, over how Trump treats America's international alliances.\n\nTrump believes that longtime American allies are somehow \"ripping off\" the US rather than contributing to world order and helping the US continue as the world's only superpower. At the same time, Trump declares his \"love\" for the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and fawns over Russian President Vladimir Putin, longtime American adversaries.\n\nNone of this makes any sense, of course. And Mattis' resignation underlines the fact that Emperor Donald Trump I is wearing absolutely no clothes.\n\nStoried military career\n\nMattis enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve when he was only 18 in 1969 at the height of the Vietnam War. He was commissioned a second lieutenant when he graduated from college in 1971.\n\nYet it was many years later that he first came to prominence. In the months after the 9/11 attacks, he led his Marines in the deepest aerial assault in US combat history near the de facto capital of the Taliban, Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. The Marines then seized the key Kandahar Airport.\n\nMattis, Gen. James Kelly, Trump's now-departing chief of staff, and Gen. Joseph Dunford, Trump's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have worked closely in various roles since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nMattis, Kelly and Dunford led the Marine force that invaded Iraq. They helped overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime in a matter of weeks.\n\nMattis co-authored with Gen. David Petraeus the 2006 counterinsurgency manual that prompted a new US approach to the Iraq War, which had become a quagmire after the successful initial invasion. The manual was highly influential in military and national security circles and even became an unlikely New York Times bestseller\n\nClash with Obama team\n\nMattis ran Central Command (CENTCOM) for President Barack Obama, overseeing American military operations in the Middle East. He pressed for military action against targets in Iran after Iranian proxy forces killed American soldiers in Iraq in 2011. This sparked a furious debate at the White House. Obama wanted to complete the negotiations for an Iranian nuclear deal, and an attack on Iranian territory would surely undercut that.\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is Gen. James 'Mad Dog' Mattis? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Gen. James 'Mad Dog' Mattis? 02:34\n\nMattis was forced by the Obama team to retire from the military five months early as a result of his hostility to Iran. Mattis learned about his defenestration when an aide passed him a note saying the Pentagon was announcing his replacement at CENTCOM. Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had bothered to give Mattis notice of his termination.\n\nSurely this experience helped inform Mattis' choice to leave the Trump team on his own terms and make clear he was quitting on principle rather than being fired. After all, Mattis' close ally, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, learned of his likely firing on a trip to Africa. Tillerson hurried back only to be informed by a Trump tweet that he was out of job.\n\nDisagreements from the start\n\nThe Trump team and Mattis had substantive disagreements almost from the start about both personnel and policy.\n\nMattis wanted to appoint experienced, competent officials in the top spots at the Pentagon. For the key job of undersecretary for policy, Mattis wanted to bring on Mary Beth Long, a former CIA operations officer who had held senior jobs at the Pentagon under President George W. Bush. But during the campaign, Long had signed a \"Never Trump\" letter, and the Trump team nixed her.\n\nFor the same key position, Mattis then tried to install Ann Patterson , a recently retired top US diplomat. The White House rejected her. As US ambassador in Egypt, Patterson had performed typical functions with the democratically elected Islamist government of Mohammed Morsi, which made her suspect to Trump officials and supporters.\n\nIn June 2017, Trump endorsed the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, its neighbor and a US ally.\n\nAs the former CENTCOM commander, Mattis knew that in many ways the most important US base overseas is the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. It is not only the \"forward\" headquarters of CENTCOM but is also where the war against ISIS is coordinated. The massive base sprawls for miles in the Qatari desert and is home to around 11,000 American military servicemen and women.\n\nTrump didn't seem to know about these facts or care about them when he applauded the Saudi blockade of Qatar. Mattis pushed back heavily on the blockade to no avail, while the Saudis have persisted with it, confident that Trump has their back.\n\nA month after the beginning of the Qatar blockade, the US military brass was blindsided by a Trump tweet ordering the banning of transgender individuals serving in the US military.\n\nThis tweet came less than a month after Mattis had announced a six-month review of the matter.\n\nTensions between Mattis and Trump amplify\n\nTrump's idiosyncratic \"America First\" foreign policy has gathered steam during the past year and it created further tensions between the president and his secretary of defense.\n\nIn June, Trump attended a G7 summit in Canada. As he left the summit on Air Force One, Trump dumped on his host , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, accusing him on Twitter of being \"very dishonest and weak\" and making \"false statements.\"\n\nTrump feuded publicly with major Western allies at a NATO summit in Brussels a month later. Departing for his trip to the NATO summit and then on to the UK before a planned meeting with Putin, Trump said, \"I have NATO. I have the UK, which is in, somewhat, turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of them all. Who would think?\"\n\nThis all contrasted with Mattis' longstanding support of NATO. On his first day in office, Mattis made a point to call the NATO secretary-general, the British defense secretary and the Canadian defense minister to emphasize the continuing US commitment to the alliance. It is one of the most successful in modern history and contributed to the peaceful implosion of the Soviet Union.\n\nSeventeen years later, NATO continues to assist and train the Afghan army.\n\nAfter treating longtime US allies with contempt, Trump has gone out of his way to give passes to and shower praise on longtime American adversaries.\n\nTrump kowtowed to Putin at the Helsinki summit in July, saying that he didn't \"see any reason why\" Russia would be responsible for interfering in the US election, going against the consensus of his own intelligence community.\n\nBy contrast, earlier this month Mattis said publicly at the Reagan Defense Forum in California that \"we simply cannot trust\" Putin.\n\nIn June, Trump attended a much-ballyhooed summit in Singapore with Kim and later declared, \"We fell in love.\"\n\nThis love affair has had scant impact on the dictator's nuclear ambitions. According to the New York Times last month, the North Koreans have accelerated their ballistic missile program at more than a dozen secret bases.\n\nIn June, Trump canceled joint US-South Korea military exercises, a staple of the alliance for decades. The move blindsided Mattis and was a gift to the North Koreans.\n\nFinal straws\n\nA sign of the fraying relationship between Trump and Mattis came in October when Trump told Lesley Stahl on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" that Mattis was \"sort of a Democrat.\"\n\nThen came the twofer last week. First, Trump announced the pullout of 2,000 soldiers from Syria. This was an early Christmas present to American enemies such as Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad and his close allies Putin and Iran, as well as to ISIS and al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. It also leaves the Kurdish forces that did almost all the fighting against ISIS on behalf of the US vulnerable to attack by the powerful Turkish military, which regards them as terrorists. In effect, Trump's decision risks abandoning an American ally on the battlefield. This was the decision that precipitated Mattis quitting.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd then came the reports of Trump's plan for a pullout of some 7,000 US troops from Afghanistan, about half the US troops in the country.\n\nThat is hardly a politically useful message to send to the struggling Afghan government, which will embark on a critical presidential election next year. Or to Afghanistan's many problematic neighbors. Or, indeed, to the Taliban, which recently started negotiating directly with the US.\n\nA principal Taliban demand is the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. Trump styles himself as a great dealmaker, but he is giving the enemy half of what they want without exacting any concessions at all.\n\nMattis was in favor of the Afghan policy that Trump announced last August, which included a troop increase and a \"conditions-based\" timeline for their withdrawal. This is all unraveling now.\n\nWhat is particularly bizarre about these policy shifts is they do exactly what Trump repeatedly warned against during his campaign. They give America's enemies an early heads up about military plans and withdrawal dates.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump also critiqued the total US troop withdrawal from Iraq under Obama as paving the way for ISIS.\n\nNow comes Mattis' resignation letter, which called out Trump on the need for \"showing respect\" to longtime allies.\n\nMattis reminded Trump that 29 NATO countries have fought \"alongside\" the US since 9/11.\n\nMattis also gently took Trump to task for his mollycoddling of Russia and its \"authoritarian model.\"\n\nIn a final dig, Mattis reminded the president that he based based his critique of Trump's polices on \"over four decades of immersion in these issues.\" That was a not-so-subtle reminder that Trump is the first US president with no political or military service and a national security neophyte.\n\nTrump won't listen, of course. But good for Mattis that he resigned on principle, a public servant in the court of Donald Trump who left with his reputation intact.\n\nQualified candidates to succeed Mattis must look at Trump's abrupt and unilateral decisions on Syria and Afghanistan and ask if they want to be part of the continuing chaos.\n\n\"Chaos,\" incidentally, was Mattis \" call sign \" on the battlefield.\n\nMattis may have brought chaos to enemies, but he tried to keep a lid on it during his two years in the Trump administration.\n\nWhat comes next? Already, Trump has stuffed his national security team with advisers who are likely to go along for the ride, including his National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, chief Middle East adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his nominee as US ambassador to the UN, Heather Nauert.\n\nIn the court of Donald Trump, there seems to be no room for independent thinkers.\n\nWho knows what the Trump show will now produce."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Source: Trump 'hates' Mattis resignation letter", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/eQH-ulxML5o/trump-hates-mattis-resignation-letter.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

ICE agents arrested him when he went to an appointment at an immigration office, then deported him to Mexico.\n\nWhile only a sliver of churches have joined the sanctuary movement, advocates say it's growing -- and North Carolina has been fertile ground.\n\nChurches in some of the state's more liberal-leaning cities led the way. Two churches in Greensboro first opened their doors. Then congregations in the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill followed suit.\n\nFor much of this year, according to one nonprofit , North Carolina was the state with the largest number of churches hosting immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nCityWell United Methodist Church in Durham was among them. That's where Samuel Oliver-Bruno took sanctuary. His sudden arrest at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office, where he'd been asked to give fingerprints as part of his application for deferred action, left a shaken community searching for answers.\n\nICE says agents arrested Samuel as part of a \"targeted enforcement action.\" He'd used a fraudulent Texas birth certificate when he entered the United States in 2014. And his case had been subject to extensive appeals since then, ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said.\n\nICE has maintained that Samuel's detention and deportation were \"in full accordance with federal law and agency policy.\" Any foreign national who's in the United States illegally is subject to arrest and removal, the agency says, no matter how long they've been living in a so-called sensitive location.\n\n\"Mr. Oliver-Bruno is a convicted criminal who has received all appropriate legal process under federal law, has no outstanding appeals and has no legal basis to remain in the US,\" Cox said.\n\nBut Samuel's supporters describe him as a devoted father and husband who'd lived in North Carolina with his family for much of the last two decades. He'd been seeking a humanitarian waiver to stay in the United States to support his wife, who suffers from lupus and other serious illnesses.\n\nAuthorities deported him this month.\n\nAnd it's not just immigrants in sanctuary who are reeling as a result. So are the churches that took them in.\n\nA seamstress mourns for her friend -- and an uncertain future\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega smiles as soon as she hears the knock on the door.\n\nShe's been preparing for this moment for hours. It will be a welcome respite after weeks of grief. Ever since Samuel's arrest, she's struggled to stop crying.\n\nIt's time for the posada, a traditional Latin American singing ritual re-enacting Joseph and Mary's search for shelter the night Jesus was born -- with half the group playing the role of the innkeeper, and the other half playing the role of pilgrims looking for a place to stay.\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega and several family members look on as the Rev. Audra Abt preaches at a holiday service. \"I want to thank you, Juana, for your faith and for your strength on this very difficult journey,\" the pastor said.\n\nJuana and her family are the innkeepers this year. They open the door, and at first sing lyrics spurning the uninvited guests.\n\n\"This is not an inn. I don't take in strangers. You might be a robber. I can't risk that danger.\"\n\nThe symbolism isn't lost on Juana or members of the church where she's been living for nearly 19 months. Juana was the first immigrant to seek sanctuary in a North Carolina church after Trump's election. She began living at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro on May 31, 2017 , decades after she first came to the United States from Guatemala seeking asylum.\n\nJuana lost her asylum case, but she'd been checking in regularly with ICE since 2011. Each year, officials renewed a stay on her removal order, allowing her to remain in the country. That changed after Trump took office. When she went to her check-in that year, officials outfitted her with an ankle monitor and said she had just a few weeks to leave the country.\n\nJuana decided seeking sanctuary was her only option. Saint Barnabas opened its doors and welcomed her.\n\nJust like Juana does at the end of today's song:\n\n\"Enter, enter, holy pilgrims, holy pilgrims. Welcome to my humble home. Though it's little I can offer, I can offer, all I have, please call your own.\"\n\nChristine Merriman loved seeing Juana at the door, letting visitors in.\n\nA church member who's spent hours by Juana's side as part of a rotation of volunteers who stay with her, Merriman says only one thing was missing.\n\n\"We should have built a border wall out of cardboard blocks,\" she says, \"then knocked it down.\"\n\nJuana laughs.\n\n\"Maybe next year we can,\" she says.\n\nThen she pauses.\n\nThis is her second Christmas in sanctuary. She hopes she won't be here for a third.\n\nBut she's afraid she will.\n\nShe never thought she'd be here this long. The 46-year-old seamstress lives in a narrow room with concrete walls covered with artwork her grandchildren covered in words of encouragement:\n\n\"USA is a free country.\"\n\n\"We know your not leaving.\"\n\n\"If unicorns love each other, we all love each other.\"\n\nAmid festive preparations for a celebration just days before Christmas, Samuel's recent deportation comes up and the mood turns somber. \"We didn't expect such bad news,\" Juana says as her granddaughter Koral Bridguett leans in to comfort her.\n\nSewing and art projects help Juana pass the time. Her four children, two grandchildren and other family members often visit on weekends. But when they're gone, depression sinks in.\n\nAnd in the last few weeks, she says, grief has overwhelmed her.\n\nShe spoke with Samuel on a weekly conference call for people in sanctuary. She'd heard how excited he was about moving forward with his case. He told the group he was doing it for all of them, not just for himself.\n\nHis arrest was a chilling reminder of a reality she'd hoped was changing.\n\n\"There is no mercy at all for us,\" she says.\n\nFor Juana, seeing how many people supported Samuel was the only blessing. It helped her remember she's not alone.\n\nA pastor waits in sanctuary, praying for a way out\n\nJos\u00e9 Chicas flips open his laptop, logs into Facebook and gets ready to hit record.\n\nIt's almost 4 a.m. -- time for the daily prayer he broadcasts to the world.\n\nBehind him, newspaper articles on the wall tell the story of a preacher who's been separated from his flock.\n\n\"Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandonado en santuario,\" one headline reads. Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandoned in sanctuary.\n\nBuoyed by support from the Rev. William Barber, Jos\u00e9 Chicas took sanctuary in the School for Conversion, on the grounds of a Durham Baptist church, in June 2017.\n\n\"That church can be your sanctuary until it is worked out in the courts,\" Barber told a rally last year . \"Let them come into the house of God and try to seize a child of God!\"\n\nIn a strip mall storefront some 30 minutes away, Jos\u00e9's wife is trying to keep their evangelical church afloat on top of her job on the cleaning crew at a local university. But the congregation's ranks have thinned. Some didn't like the idea of a woman preaching. Others felt Jos\u00e9's case was taking too long.\n\nSo now, Pastor Jos\u00e9 prays online in live videos shared with anyone who will listen.\n\nHe sways in his seat and taps his foot on the floor as he asks God for help -- for marriages that are suffering, for people who haven't found Jesus yet, for those who have strayed.\n\nJos\u00e9 believes in redemption. Using drugs and alcohol put him on a dangerous path, he says -- one that led to a conviction for DUI and domestic abuse. But those days, he says, are long ago. He draws on them to shape his sermons but says he's a changed man.\n\n\"I was lost. I will never forget that day, February 28, 2002. I changed my life,\" he says in this morning's prayer.\n\nHis voice crescendos with each sentence. This is a story he never tires of telling.\n\n\"I never touched a beer or a cigarette again,\" he says, \"because Christ changes man.\"\n\nHe misses preaching from the pulpit. Tomorrow dozens of people from his Raleigh congregation will visit for a Christmas dinner. He's been counting the days. He has gifts for all of them wrapped in his room.\n\nThis morning, the screen says only one person is watching. But Jos\u00e9 knows with each passing minute, his online flock will grow.\n\nHe prays for his 11-year-old son, who's been suffering from a stomachache and struggling in school. He prays for members of his church and for people who've posted on his Facebook wall asking for help. He prays for migrant caravans, for the Venezuelan people, for people facing violence in his native El Salvador. He prays for his neighbors and the city that's supporting him.\n\nBut those aren't the only people on his mind.\n\nAn evangelical pastor, Jos\u00e9 begins every day with a 4 a.m. prayer that he broadcasts live on Facebook.\n\nHe also prays for Samuel, whose photo still hangs on the wall in the next room, beside pictures of other immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nActivists once had dubbed them the \" NC Sanctuary 6 .\" They became the \"NC Sanctuary 5\" after a court let one of them leave the church where he'd been living.\n\nAnd now there are four.\n\nJos\u00e9 applied for the same humanitarian protection as Samuel. He doesn't know why Samuel was the first to get a letter from immigration officials, asking him to come in for an appointment. Jos\u00e9 knows he could have been the one who ended up in the back of an ICE van the day after Thanksgiving. Watching video of the arrest made his heart sink.\n\n\"Make a miracle, Lord, for my brother Samuel ... have mercy. He was just deported to Mexico, blessed father.\"\n\nThe prayer doesn't end there. Jos\u00e9 also prays for the officials who deported Samuel. He knows firsthand how God's power can transform people.\n\n\"Lord, hallelujah, have mercy, touch these immigration officers. ... Touch them. Change them,\" he says. \"Blessed God, we are not criminals, father.\"\n\nHe pauses to wipe away tears welling up in his eyes, then keeps praying.\n\nSanctuary's somber side\n\nFor immigrants living in churches, the public side to sanctuary is only part of the picture.\n\nYes, beautiful friendships are formed between people who never realized how much they had in common. And new groups of advocates step up to take a stand.\n\nBut after the fanfare of the first few days, the press conference, the push for community support, there is another side to sanctuary-- a painful reality made even more acute by Samuel's arrest.\n\nOn a bulletin board at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro, church members and Juana's family have posted reasons why they're grateful.\n\nThe Monday mornings alone when loved ones have left and pews are empty.\n\nThe sleepless nights and the crushing desire to stay in bed.\n\nThe lack of privacy and the fear of being alone.\n\nThe buoyancy of feeling embraced by strangers and the devastation of feeling abandoned by friends.\n\nThe constant search for a way out. The fear it may never come.\n\nFacing questions he doesn't know how to answer\n\nWith his children by his side, Eliseo Jimenez joins his church in prayer.\n\n\"Every month we need healing,\" the congregation says in unison, \"but December can be the hardest time of year.\"\n\nThis will be Eliseo's second Christmas in sanctuary.\n\nHe's been living here almost 15 months.\n\nBeing separated from his children each week is devastating. There's a white board on the wall of his bedroom where his kids -- 6-year-old Allison and 5-year-old Christopher -- like to doodle when they come to visit.\n\n\"I love you dad,\" Allison wrote.\n\n\"Me too,\" Eliseo replied.\n\nEliseo Jimenez and his 5-year-old son Christopher watch a worship service at Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh. Jimenez, 40, has been living in the church since October 2017.\n\nBut being with his kids is hard, too. Allison asks questions he's not sure how to answer. Why can't he go to the park to play with them? Why doesn't he go home with them on Sunday nights? Eliseo tries to change the subject. He doesn't want to ruin their childhood.\n\nWhen they visit, they spend most of their time playing inside. Eliseo's skittish being outdoors, even in the church parking lot.\n\n\"I have to be on the lookout for any strange car or any person,\" he says. \"It's always the fear to go outside and be distracted playing with the kids, and there might be somebody.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico has lived most of his life in the United States. He was deported once in 2007. And since October 2017, he's been living here, in Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh, to try to keep that from happening again.\n\nSamuel's picture is on a bulletin board near the room where Eliseo sleeps. About a year ago, Samuel visited Eliseo, asking for advice before going into sanctuary.\n\nFind something to do around your church, Eliseo told him, \"fixing, cleaning or helping anybody possible with anything.\"\n\nThat, Eliseo says, is what's kept him sane.\n\nToday, as he sits in the church's second row, Eliseo looks with pride at something he built that's on display behind the pulpit -- a miniature replica of the stable where Jesus was born.\n\nThe children's director mentions it as she calls kids to the front of the room for their portion of the Sunday service.\n\n\"During this season we like to talk about hope and peace,\" Peg Arcari says. \"We can talk about spreading joy. If somebody says they need help, we should share and be kind to one another.\"\n\nAs the children circle around her, Arcari points to Eliseo's work.\n\n\"By creating this stable,\" she says, \"Allison and Christopher's dad spread some joy.\"\n\nEliseo tries to keep things as normal as possible for his kids when they come to visit. But they've started to ask questions he doesn't know how to answer, like why he can't play in the park or go with them out to dinner.\n\nBeing stuck in here over the holidays is difficult. But Eliseo says he's lived through worse.\n\nSeveral years ago, he spent Christmas inside the Stewart Detention Center in South Georgia, the largest immigrant detention center in the Southeast . Authorities threatened to deport him that week. They put him on a bus and said they were sending him back to Mexico.\n\nThe only way he could convince someone to listen to him was by smashing his head so hard into a seat that he started bleeding. Then they double checked his files and discovered that an attorney had submitted a new petition for him to stay in the country.\n\nEliseo was released from custody that day. He says an official told him as long as he stayed out of trouble and kept checking in with ICE, he'd be in the clear. But Eliseo says that changed for him and so many others after Trump took office. They suddenly found their work permits weren't being renewed and long-delayed deportation orders were taking effect.\n\nSince the day he left Stewart, he hasn't been able to shake the feeling of constant fear. No matter what happens with his case, he doesn't think he ever will.\n\nHaunting nightmares\n\nThe glow of holiday lights reflects on Rosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz's face as she sits beside a small Christmas tree.\n\nIn a matter of days, her children will be visiting, but she doesn't feel much like celebrating.\n\nShe feels trapped inside the room where she's living. Last night she couldn't sleep. She's been crying all morning.\n\nSince she entered sanctuary at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill in April, Rosa has regularly spoken with her children on the phone. Their photos hang on the wall in the converted office that's become her bedroom. \"I love my babies,\" one picture says. But visits can be heartbreaking. It crushes her every time her children walk out the door.\n\nAn immigration court in Charlotte has ordered her deportation. But Rosa is appealing. She never expected the wait for an answer would take so long.\n\nShe jumps every time her phone rings, hoping her attorney is calling with news.\n\nAnd since Samuel's arrest, she's felt even more on edge. She's afraid to talk on the phone about her case -- and afraid of what will happen next.\n\n\"There's a heightened level of fear,\" says the Rev. Isaac Villegas of Chapel Hill Mennonite Fellowship, which rents space at Church of Reconciliation and is co-hosting Rosa in sanctuary. \"We have someone at the church 24 hours a day just to make Rosa feel safer and to keep her safe.\"\n\nRosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz chats with volunteer Libby Johnson as she makes pupusas at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill. The two women have become close friends since Rosa began living at the church in April.\n\nRosa is terrified to return to Honduras, a country she fled after her partner stabbed her. She says he's threatened to kill her if she ever returns.\n\nWhen she does manage to sleep, a recurring nightmare haunts her. Night after night, she dreams immigration agents are chasing her.\n\nSometimes she wishes she would fall asleep and not wake up. Then, she says, the real-life nightmare she's living would end.\n\nAs Rosa tears up, Libby Johnson offers a hug.\n\nRosa smiles. The warm embrace, and the love she's received from Libby and so many others at the church, have given her strength in her darkest hours.\n\nShe's grateful God put so many good people in her path.\n\nThe day Samuel was detained, Libby was one of 27 supporters who were arrested.\n\nAs she rushed to the immigration office that day, she thought of the many hours she'd spent with Rosa, and how important it is to stand up for others and live the morals the church teaches.\n\n\"It's a call,\" she says. \"If you really want to walk your talk, then you need to take risk.\"\n\nTaking a risk to help undocumented immigrants seems to be something more churches in the area are interested in doing after Samuel's arrest, Villegas says. Several new congregations have come forward to say they want to host someone in sanctuary.\n\nHe tells anyone who's interested that they need to be prepared to stick it out for the long haul.\n\n\"This could be multiple years,\" he says, \"because Trump won't change anything.\"\n\nThe hole he left behind\n\nSamuel's room at CityWell is empty, but it's full of reminders of the life that was lived here and the man who is missing.\n\nWedding photos are taped to the armoire door. Notes he took during a Duke Divinity School class are sitting on a nearby table. So is a stack of books he'd been studying. \"Aprenda Ingl\u00e9s para Conversar\" -- Learn English for Conversation -- is at the top.\n\nA sign on the door still says, \"Oliver Family's Home.\"\n\nThe room is still and quiet, but the church's pastor still hears Samuel's voice every time he walks by.\n\nThe music minister thinks of him when he passes by the prayer room across the hall that Samuel -- who'd worked for years as a drywall contractor -- helped build.\n\nUpstairs in the worship hall, someone taped a sign to the wooden chair where Samuel used to sit during services.\n\n\"Samuel's seat,\" it says. \"Keep praying.\"\n\nA sign marks the chair where Samuel Oliver-Bruno used to sit during services at CityWell United Methodist Church. The Rev. Cleve May says his congregation is grieving, but not giving up. \"The story of God in this world is God showing up in the midst of injustice and oppression,\" he says.\n\nThe Sunday after his deportation, Samuel sent the church a video message from Mexico. It was broadcast on TV screens during services.\n\n\"Even though I am in my country, I feel afraid,\" he said. But he added that the North Carolina congregation was still giving him strength.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, I love you all a lot. You will always be with me. Everywhere I go I will talk about all of you, about how much love and support you gave my family.\"\n\nSince Samuel's arrest, CityWell pastor the Rev. Cleve May says he and others have been wrestling with tough questions about the sanctuary movement's future.\n\n\"One of the gambles the sanctuary movement makes is that ICE really doesn't want to kick the hornet's nest of people with privilege,\" May says. \"If you traumatize their church, they're going to throw a real stink. The publicity of this is a deterrent to ICE.\n\n\"It has been thought that the public exposure of sanctuary would serve as a prophylactic to ICE aggression, that surely they wouldn't come somewhere where the light is really bright. I'm not sure we can bank on that anymore.\"\n\nHe sees Samuel's arrest as a violation of sanctuary.\n\nThose who went with Samuel to his appointment were praying and singing religious songs outside the immigration office.\n\n\"For us it was a statement that sanctuary is not a building,\" he says. \"It was people saying to a person, 'You belong with us and we stand with you.'\"\n\nCelebrating the holidays without Samuel is difficult, May says, but darkness and joy can coexist. Grieving the loss has become part of the church's identity.\n\n\"The presence of God doesn't erase the presence of pain,\" he says.\n\nAnd nothing will erase the many ways Samuel shaped the church and his friends there.\n\nIn worship, he says, they're still singing songs Samuel taught them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Congolese boy who traveled to US to have facial tumor removed dies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/6Li27biqjk0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Congolese boy who traveled to the United States to have a tumor removed from his face died Friday, the organization who sponsored him said in a statement.\n\nThe Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, created by the former NBA player, said in a statement on Instagram on Saturday that Matadi Sela Petit, 8, died after suffering a rare genetic reaction to anesthesia during surgery.\n\n\"Despite the diligent efforts of his medical caregivers, Matadi did not recover and he passed away last night,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Mutombo Foundation sponsored Matadi's trip to the United States.

Lying to a licensed gun dealer is a felony punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.\n\nBreaking that law might seem risky. But in September, a Government Accountability Office study made it clear why those who \"lie and try\" would take their chances. Regional offices at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives received 12,710 cases of firearm background check denials for further investigation in fiscal year 2017, the GAO found, but the government prosecuted only 12 people. More than 99.9% of those who were investigated escaped with nothing more than a warning.\n\nPast and present ATF agents and prosecutors told CNN that, given limited resources, they're not inclined to prioritize the nonviolent crime of lying on a form over more serious charges, like gun trafficking. The very few \"lie and try\" cases they prosecute focus on dangerous \"trigger pullers\" who clearly know they're prohibited from owning a firearm -- career criminals with a history of violence or activity in the drug trade.\n\nBut a 2006 internal ATF briefing paper obtained by CNN suggests that gun form liars are far more likely to go on to commit a gun crime than even many experts recognize. When ATF analyzed firearm denial cases sent to field offices for investigation during a seven-year period, it found that 10%-21% of that group went on to be arrested for a crime involving guns.\n\nTake John Zawahri, who tried to buy a gun at a California dealer in 2011. State investigators spotted at least one disqualifier -- he had been held at the UCLA hospital psychiatric ward as a violence-prone teen. The California Department of Justice denied him the purchase.\n\nLike almost all gun-form liars, Zawahri was not prosecuted. Undeterred, he built his own semi-automatic rifle mostly from mail-order parts and, two years later, went on a rampage. On June 7, 2013, he set his home on fire, executed his father and older brother with shots to the chest, then hijacked a car to Santa Monica College and killed three others. Dozens of students and bystanders managed to survive by hiding behind restaurant tables and library doors. Police officers caught up to Zawahri at the college library, where they shot him 25 times in a gun battle.\n\nWould prosecution for having lied on a gun form have stopped Zawahri from building his own gun and going on to use it? \"I don't believe it would make a difference. There would have been some short jail term, or probation, and he still would have accumulated the gun parts in the two years after that,\" Santa Monica Homicide Detective Chad Goodwin told CNN.\n\nBut a surprising range of authorities have argued that enforcing \"lie and try\" could make a difference -- including not only anti-gun groups and criminal justice academics, but also former law enforcement officers, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration, and even the National Rifle Association. By failing to bring charges in cases like Zawahri's, the government is leaving thousands of lawbreakers without any new blemish to their names.\n\nLike almost all Americans who lie on federal gun forms, John Zawahri was not prosecuted. He was one of many gun form liars who go on to commit crimes with a gun.\n\nThat reduces the law's function as a deterrent to prohibited possessors who might hope to get lucky with the federal background check system. It also allows gun form liars to fly under the radar for law enforcement -- and to avoid being assigned a probation officer who would monitor them to make sure they didn't obtain a weapon. And, in the event of a later crime, it leaves what could have been a significant previous charge -- which might typically lead to more prison time -- off their records.\n\nDavid Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that prosecutors and law enforcement officials should rid themselves of the idea that lying on gun forms is a crime not worth pursuing. \"It's worthwhile to go after these cases. The prosecution in question here is failing to fill out a form accurately. That doesn't seem like a big deal. But prosecution is a means to an end -- getting dangerous people off the street.\"\n\nIn Zawahri's case, failure to prosecute probably meant that the young man's years-long obsession with guns and violence stayed below the notice of investigators. Instead, his name merely became one of thousands sitting on law enforcement lists of those who have tried to purchase guns illegally and failed.\n\nA low priority for overburdened agents\n\nWhen you try to buy a firearm at a licensed dealer, you must fill out a federal form that asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using any illegal drugs, subject to a restraining order, or inside the United States illegally. It also asks if you've previously been convicted of a felony or domestic violence, adjudicated \"as a mental defective,\" dishonorably discharged from the military, or if you've ever renounced US citizenship.\n\nIf you're prohibited and answer truthfully, a gun dealer is supposed to scrap the sale. If you lie, a subsequent background check conducted by law enforcement is supposed to find any disqualifiers in your record. Twenty-nine states and Washington DC rely on the FBI for all firearm sale background checks, 13 states do their own, and 8 split the work. Then the cases are referred to law enforcement: It's up to ATF to investigate federal background check denials, while local police handle state-level denials. After the law enforcement agents investigate, they present potential cases to local or federal prosecutors, who ultimately decide whether to charge someone with a crime.\n\nThe federal gun form asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using illegal drugs, or inside the United States illegally, among other things.\n\nThe federal form, and the penalty for false statements on it, is there to discourage prohibited possessors from trying to buy guns in the first place. But a person only breaks the law if a prosecutor can show they \"knowingly\" made a false statement. That can be difficult to prove. Some people who approach a gun shop counter might legitimately forget about a decades-old domestic violence conviction or a felony they committed as a teen, current and former ATF agents said.\n\nStill, even for someone who is perfectly aware they're a prohibited possessor, it can be worth trying to buy a gun, because so few cases meet US attorneys' standards for potential criminal prosecution. The federal background check system blocked 112,090 attempts to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017. About a tenth of them were referred to ATF field offices for further investigation.\n\nEven when ATF agents do discover a potential gun buyer committed a crime, US attorneys usually don't have the appetite to take on these cases. According to the recent GAO report, federal prosecutors rarely pursue criminal charges, due to a perception that trying these cases in court \"may offer little value to public safety because the offender does not obtain the firearm.\"\n\nStates that handle these cases are also reluctant to divert troopers or local police away from their regular duties to look into this crime. When the GAO surveyed the 13 states that do their own background checks for all gun purchases, it found that 10 of them don't even investigate these denials, \"citing competing resource demands\" and a lack of laws on the books. The only states that investigated gun purchase denials were Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- and cases in those states had a high bar.\n\n\"We were surprised about the challenges,\" said Gretta Goodwin, who oversaw the study as GAO director of homeland security and justice issues. \"States were pretty clear with us that doing these investigations could be disruptive. They were taking state troopers off the road. They were having to make these kinds of sacrifices or tradeoffs.\"\n\nTo some criminal justice experts, the shortage of law enforcement resources to crack down on illegal attempted purchases of firearms is a symptom of a larger problem: We live in a country with more guns than we can afford to track. The sheer number of guns in civilian hands, they say -- 393 million, by one count -- fuel this problem in a way that will always outpace police efforts.\n\n\"This resource strain is a function of the system we have in place. There's a huge social cost for having a Second Amendment and relatively lax gun laws,\" said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nA stunning internal report\n\nIn an interview, former ATF special agent in charge David Chipman confirmed that he commissioned the 2006 internal report. He had been \"absolutely stunned\" by the results, he said.\n\n\"The assumption was these people weren't a threat,\" Chipman told CNN. He is now a senior policy adviser at the pro-gun control group Giffords.\n\nThe headquarters of ATF in Washington, DC. Internal research there found that a significant percentage of those left unprosecuted for the felony of lying on a gun form will go on to commit a gun crime.\n\nThe 30-page internal study explored how, despite an order from then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to crack down on \"those who attempt to purchase guns illegally,\" ATF agents rarely presented cases to prosecutors -- even if the cases met these attorneys' stringent guidelines. The study also highlighted the surprising importance of these cases by taking a closer look at some of the 82,047 cases ATF sent to its field offices for investigation from late 1998 until early 2006. Out of a random sample of 202 cases, 30 of them showed a \"subsequent arrest history (that) appeared to involve a firearm\" during the seven-year review period. Based on that, the report concluded that an estimated 10%-21% of people denied gun purchases -- whose cases made their way to ATF field offices -- committed \"subsequent crimes (that) involved firearms\" during the span of the study.\n\nIf the decade-old study's findings hold up, it suggests that anywhere from 1,322 to 2,631 of the 12,710 people who attempted to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017, failed a background check, and had their cases sent to ATF field offices, would eventually get a gun and commit a crime. Two criminal policy academics who reviewed the ATF paper at CNN's request said they were confident in the research paper's methodology and conclusions, and they think the rate of subsequent gun crimes by attempted purchasers would likely be the same or higher today.\n\nChipman thinks the problem may have gotten worse. Since 2006, online exchanges that connect buyers and sellers have changed the marketplace, making it easier than ever for a prohibited person to find a private seller and avoid a background check when buying a firearm. Federal law requires licensed gun shops to conduct background checks, but not private sellers.\n\nAnd states have a difficult time cracking down on a burgeoning phenomenon: mail-order gun parts and do-it-yourself \"ghost gun\" kits, like the ones that allowed Zawahri to construct his own firearm in California. Webster, the Johns Hopkins professor, noted that private gun ownership in general has significantly increased, flooding the market with weapons that criminals may obtain through theft or undocumented sales.\n\nSince the 2006 study, ATF has not assessed the threat from people who lie on gun background check forms, the agency told CNN. And the original paper remained unknown to the public, as is typical for such internal briefing papers. Asked why it was not released, ATF spokeswoman April Langwell told CNN: \"The draft report to which you refer is now 12 years old. I do not know why it was not finalized/released ... & obviously the individuals who were working then are long gone.\"\n\nChipman, who commissioned the briefing paper, said that the report was final and not a draft. \"The biggest frustration I ever had working at ATF is that some of this high-level data about what happens after people are denied\" never reaches the public, he said.\n\n\"It really is something the people need to know,\" he said. \"Facts matter. There's science and data. And that data should be out there ... it solidifies what the real challenges are so that policymakers have a shared group of facts.\"\n\nNew interest in lie-and-try; but so far, little change\n\nThe GAO investigator who recently reviewed prosecution of \"lie and try\" cases told CNN she was surprised to learn about the internal ATF statistics on subsequent crimes committed by people who provide false information on gun buying forms. The GAO was not aware of the briefing paper, GAO's Goodwin told CNN. Even without that information, however, the GAO acknowledged that a major crackdown would require more resources for law enforcement.\n\nThe GAO found that ATF agents sometimes simply send denied purchasers a text message or letter to deter future attempts -- and potentially serve as future evidence that the person knew they were prohibited. ATF officials told GAO they prefer text messages over official-looking warning letters because text messages \"are less intimidating to prohibited persons, the texts save time and money, and are more effective in helping retrieve firearms.\"\n\nThe GAO report suggests that ATF review the benefits of using text messages and warning letters \"as an enforcement tool,\" and perhaps consider making this an agency-wide policy. An ATF spokesman said there's no rigid policy at the agency for making contact with those who lie and try. Less serious cases, like those involving someone with a decades-old felony who tried to buy what's considered a turkey-hunting shotgun, result in a simple courtesy phone call to inform a rejected gun buyer why they were denied. More serious cases, like those involving domestic abusers who try to buy a handgun shortly after conviction, might result in a formal warning letter by mail or even a knock on the door.\n\nIn a country that has become increasingly polarized into Second Amendment rights and gun control camps, lie-and-try enforcement could be one area of consensus. The Democratic congressman who commissioned the report, US Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of the Bronx in New York, told CNN of its release: \"This is one rare moment where we can agree on guns.\"\n\n\"The laws we have should be enforced. We don't fund these agencies properly,\" he said. \"The end result is that people are getting guns who shouldn't get guns.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of 10 senators led by US Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in March that would force the FBI to notify local law enforcement whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and fails the background check. The NICS Denial Notification Act would not provide additional funding for local police to investigate gun form lying, but it would put lawbreakers on their radar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Toomey called his bill \"a commonsense, yet critical, step Congress should take to strengthen gun safety laws.\"\n\n\"One thing that both parties agree on when it comes to gun safety is that we should enforce the laws that we already have on the books,\" US Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, a co-sponsor of the bill, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House version of the bill is in a similar stage. A previous version of the bill, as written by US Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, failed to make it through the House in 2017.\n\nThe lobbying power that most fiercely opposes new gun laws, the National Rifle Association, told CNN it does not oppose the bill. As long as 18 years ago, the organization was calling for tougher crackdowns on prohibited possessors who attempt to buy firearms, framing the issue this way: \" prosecution is prevention .\"\n\n\"The National Rifle Association continues to support the prosecution of dangerous people who knowingly attempt to illegally purchase a firearm,\" said Lars Dalseide, an NRA spokesman.\n\nBecause the bill lacks new funding to pay for local officers to actually follow up on the additional criminal data, former ATF agents tell CNN they doubt the bill will be effective. A spokesman for Coons said the senator would be willing to support a funding provision for the bill \"if more resources are required to do the job correctly.\"\n\nIn March, former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo to step up enforcement of lying on gun forms, directing all of the country's US attorneys to \"enhance prosecution\" in each of their districts \"to ensure vigorous and appropriate prosecution of 'lie-and-try' cases.\" The memo still puts \"particular emphasis on cases against violent persons,\" such as those with previous convictions for violent felonies and misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.\n\n\"We are proud to have taken the most aggressive action to step up lie-and-try prosecutions in nearly a decade,\" a DOJ spokesman told CNN. He added that, under Sessions, the department has stepped up gun prosecutions in general, evident because it has \"charged the highest number of federal firearm defendants in history this past year.\" In fiscal year 2018, the federal government charged more than 15,300 people with firearms offenses -- 17% higher than ever before, according to the DOJ.\n\nThe attorney general's directive came as the GAO was ending its review, so the report didn't capture a possible shift on prosecutorial standards. Sessions ordered prosecutors in the nation's 94 judicial districts to meet with ATF and revise local prosecution guidelines \"as necessary.\" These guidelines are important, because they determine whether the feds in each district are willing to pursue charges -- and whether the bar could be higher, say, in Miami than in San Francisco.\n\nWhen asked by CNN, however, ATF could not point to any change in the way its agents approach these types of cases since the directive from Sessions. The agency indicated that it had \"met with all (US attorney's offices and) reviewed the guidelines.\"\n\nEven to find out what those prosecutorial standards are, and how they differ by region, is no easy task. In January, CNN filed a public records request to ATF for copies of the guidance it receives from local prosecutors about which cases to refer. ATF has not yet formally responded, but a spokesman redirected CNN to the Executive Office for the US Attorneys. CNN filed a similar request with that agency in June. It redirected CNN back to ATF.\n\nSome states have begun to recognize what a danger sign it can be for a prohibited person to skirt the law and try to buy a gun. Last year, Washington became the first state that notifies victims of domestic violence when their convicted abuser attempts to purchase a firearm. Gun dealers there must notify a state association of police and sheriffs whenever someone fails a background check, and the state's \"automated protected person notification system\" then passes on the information. Domestic violence groups in other states are taking notice.\n\n\"Too often our system turns a blind eye to how dangerous a case could be,\" said Tara Muir, policy director at the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. A prohibited person's attempt to buy a gun \"has to be one of the most dangerous indicators there is.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says Mattis to leave by end of year, announces new acting secretary of defense", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/vA8hxwhrlOY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced on Sunday he would replace Defense Secretary James Mattis at the start of the new year, two months earlier than Mattis' planned departure.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019.

Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\n\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.\n\nI pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mystery company involved in Mueller investigation appeals to Supreme Court", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/iOdFb8WJsA0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) An unnamed, foreign government-owned company in a mystery court case is asking the Supreme Court to pause a grand jury subpoena it received related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nThe Supreme Court appeal comes after a federal appeals court ruling that ordered the company to comply with the subpoena, which required it to turn over \"information\" about its commercial activity in a criminal investigation.

We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise 02:34\n\nThe report wasn't all doom and gloom; it also had some positive findings.\n\n\"Childhood poverty has decreased,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That's a key indicator of somebody's socioeconomic status and a good predictor of how their overall health is going to be for the rest of their life. That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes. What we would like to see is all states improving.\"\n\nHopes for better health in the new year\n\nAs the nation looks toward 2019, Randall said, she has some hopes for public health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"What I hope we will see next year is that some of these trends really start to go in a better direction. As an example, the smoking trend in the United States has come down consistently over the 29 years of this report. That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year.

Three people who got injections or infusions of umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products at a Texas outpatient clinic on September 12 developed bloodstream infections.\n\nOn September 22, the Florida Department of Health was notified that four people had joint infections after getting injections from a Florida orthopedic clinic between February 15 and August 30. When scientists looked at some of the unopened products at that clinic, they found E. coli and E. faecalis bacteria.\n\nThe report does not offer details on the patient in Arizona. Dr. Kiran Perkins with the CDC's Outbreak and Response Team, who co-authored Thursday's report, said there is some lab work pending in the Arizona case.\n\n\"That clinic didn't have any of the product left,\" Perkins said. \"That is part of the challenge of this investigation: A lot of the clinics don't have any of the product left.\"\n\nPerkins added that the CDC is concerned about the severity of these infections, as all the patients mentioned in the report were hospitalized. \"This particular outbreak has the potential for serious health risks and concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe distributor, Liveyon, issued a national recall of Regen series products in October and suspended shipment of all product pending the outcome of the FDA investigation, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC believes that the bacterial contamination of the stem cell-derived products occurred before distribution. An investigation is taking a closer look at the manufacturing practices and at the safety practices at the clinics to determine whether there was proper infection control.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that an inspection of the Genetech manufacturing facility in June found \"significant deviations\" that included \"deficient donor eligibility practices; unvalidated manufacturing processes; uncontrolled environment; lack of control over the components used in production and a lack of defined areas or a control system to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\"\n\nThe CDC noted that stem cell clinics typically work in an outpatient setting, \"which often have less robust oversight of infection control measures,\" and that's in part why the FDA recommends that patients avoid getting these treatments outside controlled clinical studies that will ensure that the appropriate manufacturing and safety reporting procedures were followed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC is still trying to determine whether other patients received the tainted product.

The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.\n\nExcept, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide.\n\nIt is not clear at this stage whether part of the flank of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in sediment under the water surface.\n\nThe latter at this stage appears to be the emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed and waves propagate outwards.\n\nHow common are tsunamis in Indonesia?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit\n\nIndonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.\n\nIn September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.\n\nHowever, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.\n\nKrakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)\n\nImage copyright Oystein Lund Andersen\n\nIn August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:\n\nMassive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people\n\nThousands more were killed by hot ash\n\nThe eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945\n\nThe eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away\n\nWorld temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year\n\nThe volcanic island virtually disappeared\n\nAre you in the affected area?

The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.\n\nExcept, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide.\n\nIt is not clear at this stage whether part of the flank of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in sediment under the water surface.\n\nThe latter at this stage appears to be the emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed and waves propagate outwards.\n\nHow common are tsunamis in Indonesia?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit\n\nIndonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.\n\nIn September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.\n\nHowever, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.\n\nKrakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)\n\nImage copyright Oystein Lund Andersen\n\nIn August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:\n\nMassive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people\n\nThousands more were killed by hot ash\n\nThe eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945\n\nThe eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away\n\nWorld temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year\n\nThe volcanic island virtually disappeared\n\nAre you in the affected area?

That breaks down to a larger deficit of \u00a395bn for goods, but a surplus of \u00a328bn for services.\n\nSo in total, the amount of exports potentially at risk from new trade barriers is greater for the 27 than for the UK.\n\nBut that is a rather crude measure of how much each side has to lose.\n\nLet's take another example to illustrate the point.\n\nWhat does Andorra have to do with Brexit?\n\nThe EU - with a population of more than half a billion and an annual economic activity or GDP of around \u00a315 trillion - has a trade surplus with Andorra, which has a population of about 80,000 and GDP of less than \u00a33bn.\n\nDoes that mean that the EU needs Andorra more than Andorra needs the EU? It would, of course, be an absurd suggestion.\n\nWhy? Because the EU's economy is so much larger.\n\nFor sure, disruptions to that trade would be a serious problem for some Spanish and French businesses and jobs near the border. But for the EU economy as a whole the impact would be tiny.\n\nNow to state the obvious, the UK is not Andorra. It matters far more to the EU as an export market than Andorra does.\n\nThat said, a more revealing measure of what is at stake is to look at the amount of trade exposed to some risk of new barriers as a percentage of either a country's total exports or GDP.\n\nTake goods first, as goods and services data is generally collected differently and is often published separately.\n\nThe EU 27 accounts for 48% of UK exports of goods, and 8% of GDP (in 2017, from the European Commission database).\n\nWhen we look at the share of the EU's exports going to the UK there is a choice to make about whether to include trade among the remaining 27 EU countries in total goods exports. If we do include it, the UK share is 6.2%; if we don't it's 18% of the total. UK exports account for 2.3% of the EU 27 GDP.\n\nYou sometimes hear the suggestion that these figures miss an important point because the two biggest players in the EU, Germany and France, are the true political driving forces in the EU. So are they any more reliant on the UK market than the EU average?\n\nFor Germany, the figures are 6.6% of goods exports going to the UK, accounting for 2.6% of GDP. The latter figure is slightly above the EU average.\n\nFor France, the equivalent figures are 6.7% of exports and 1.4% of GDP, the latter comfortably below the average for the EU as a whole.\n\nThe countries that do have a relatively large exposure to the UK are Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nAnd what about Germany's carmakers? They didn't show up for battle in the way David Davis hoped. The head of Germany's car industry association Matthias Wissman said last year: \"however important the United Kingdom is to us as a market, the cohesion of the EU 27 and their single market are even more important to our industry\".\n\nThat said, the UK would be a leading export market for the EU 27. For goods in 2017 it was very slightly behind the US, but well ahead of the next largest China. But it is important to remember: internal trade within the EU is really big for the 27.\n\nCould the 'Rotterdam effect' complicate the picture?\n\nThere is a significant complication underneath these figures, sometimes known as the Rotterdam effect.\n\nExports are generally recorded as going to their first destination. So if a container goes initially to Rotterdam in the Netherlands (or Antwerp in Belgium or some other ports) and is then transferred for onward transport to somewhere else, it is nonetheless recorded as an export to (or an import from) the Netherlands (or another EU country).\n\nIt has proved impossible to quantify this effect with any real precision. It affects figures for trade going into the UK and out.\n\nBut even if we make some fairly extreme guesses about its magnitude, the UK still exports more as a share of its own GDP to the EU 27 than the other way round.\n\nWhat about services?\n\nFor the services trade, the case is even clearer.\n\nThe UK economy is both smaller than the EU's and has a services trade surplus.\n\nIn 2016, services exports to the EU were 7.2% of UK GDP; for the EU 27 services exports to the UK were 1.1% of their GDP.\n\nAll these figures point in the same direction. The UK looks more exposed in the event of disruption to trade relations.\n\nThat is not to say the impact on the EU would be trivial, far from it.\n\nThe EU 27 would undoubtedly face significant economic harm from major disturbances to their trade with the UK. But on the basis of the trade data, the \"they need us more\" claim looks very shaky.\n\nOne point to add about the data. You may see figures elsewhere that are somewhat different.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in the way trade data are put together in different countries.\n\nSome of the figures involve converting currencies and exchange rates vary. And there variations from year to year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Gavin Williamson: UK ship in Ukraine 'sends message to Russia'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46657470", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:00:42", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption HMS Echo docked in the Black Sea on Friday, before Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson visited\n\nA Royal Navy warship which has been sent to Ukraine will send a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the UK's defence secretary says.\n\nHMS Echo was sent into the Black Sea earlier this month, after Russia seized three ships belonging to Ukraine's navy and their crews.\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson has visited the ship in the port of Odessa.\n\nHe said the presence of the British ship shows support for Ukraine in the face of increased Russian aggression.\n\nIt will be followed by other warships as part of a more constant British presence, he said.\n\nNato has recently stepped up its operations in the Black Sea with increased warship patrols.\n\nThere are increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine over access to the area off the coast of Crimea.\n\nCrimea used to be part of an independent Ukraine, but it was annexed by Russia in 2014.

the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London.\n\nIn the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure.\n\nIt is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nKate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nMore than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.\n\nLouise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: \"We're delighted that NHS England has decided to fund this life-changing and potential life-saving treatment from April 2019 onwards.\n\n\"We'll be working with TSC clinics across England to help them get ready to prescribe this drug to more people who can benefit from it.\"\n\nThe other treatments that will be funded from 1 April 2019 are:\n\nSmall bowel transplantation service (adults) and small bowel transplantation (children)\n\nSelexipag for pulmonary hypertension\n\nTrientine dihydrochloride for Wilson's Disease\n\nSelective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for chemotherapy refractory / intolerant metastatic colorectal cancer\n\nMetreleptin for

in sugar and salt.\n\nChief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for everyone from the proceeds.\n\nIn her annual report, she also urged the government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food.\n\nThe food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour.\n\nDame Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier.\n\nThis means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said.\n\nBased on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said\n\nDame Sally said \"industry had not delivered\" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more.\n\n\"Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,\" her report says.\n\nShe hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.\n\nBut she recognised this was \"a dream\".\n\nThe report recommends:\n\nextending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks\n\na ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food\n\nmore ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011\n\ntaxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start\n\nincentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables\n\nAnd it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities.\n\nDame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer.\n\nShe said she would be accused of being \"chief nanny\" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a \"dream\"\n\n\"We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,\" Dame Sally said.\n\n\"It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school.\"\n\nThe report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made.\n\n'Wrong-headed legislation'\n\nA spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry \"fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes\".\n\nKate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade.\n\nBut she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight.\n\n\"Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.\n\n\"It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined.\"\n\nAnd she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour.\n\n\"Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a33.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management services and exercise support.\n\nIt represents a real terms cut of 4.6% since last year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "'Drunk tanks' to ease NHS pressure",

But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP. If you need a flu jab, go and see a GP - as if we're a one-stop shop.\"\n\nBut the RCGP said a lack of GPs was also affecting availability.\n\n\"We're now 1,000 short of the number of GPs we had when they promised 5,000 more - so now we're looking for 6,000,\" an RCGP official said.\n\nIs it safe to wait weeks for an appointment?\n\nSome patients are happy to wait. They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\n\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\n\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected,\n\n\"There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,\" she said.\n\nProf Stokes-Lampard said: \"There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed.\"\n\nAnd Dr Mahtani said: \"How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them.\n\n\"And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm.\"\n\nAre all practices affected?\n\nNo - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs.\n\n\"All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a domino effect. And then it's phenomenally stressful for the doctors at that practice.\"\n\nIs there anything that will help?\n\nGPs say patients can help - by calling in if they can't make an appointment, so it can be freed up for someone else, and by thinking whether they could get the advice they need somewhere else, such as the chemist's or dentist.\n\nThere are various ideas being tried out across general practice too, experimenting with taking some of the administration away from GPs and bringing in other professions, physiotherapists and social workers, into primary care in addition to the specialist nurses that many people are already familiar with.\n\nTechnology can also help - some practices have online systems where patients can book directly.\n\nBut Dr Mahtani said there was no single solution - because each practice had a different mix of patients and different skills among its staff.\n\nBetter funding was key though. \"If you invest in primary care, you will reduce your costs in secondary care - 90% of first contacts are in primary care,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to embrace general practice.\"\n\nWhat's your experience of booking a routine appointment with your GP or practice nurse?

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Warning against 'volcano tourism' risks", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46621304", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThrill-seeking tourists are putting themselves in danger and hampering emergency services by heading towards volcanoes when they erupt.\n\nA report from the Royal Geographical Society warns of the growing risks caused by \"volcano tourism\".\n\nEmergency authorities in countries such as Iceland now have to contend with the arrival of tourists who rush there to get close to an exploding volcano.\n\nThe study says such tourists fail to understand the seriousness of the risk.\n\nThe study, published by the Royal Geographical Society and written by University of Cambridge geographer Amy Donovan, warns that such visitors can create dangerous problems for already stretched rescue services.\n\n'Volcanophiles'\n\nThe phenomenon of \"volcano tourism\" has seen thousands of people trying to get close to the site of erupting volcanoes for the physical experience of seeing, hearing and feeling the heat of such a natural spectacle.\n\nDr Donovan says that such people are fascinated by the elemental power of volcanoes and are attracted by such an intense experience.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption How close is too close for tourists chasing volcanoes?\n\n\"You can breathe the gas, hear the sounds the earth is making.

He hence ordered the full withdrawal of US troops from Iraq at the end of 2011.\n\nIn June 2014, Mosul's fall to ISIL forced Obama to get involved in Iraq once again. A US-led international coalition to defeat ISIL and prevent it from establishing a state across Syria and Iraq was formed. However, Obama was still reluctant to commit a large number of ground forces to this fight, so he relied on local proxies to fight ISIL.\n\n181220124910471\n\nIn Iraq, Obama worked with the Iraqi government, Kurdish Peshmerga and Shia militias against ISIL. In Syria, the Syria Democratic Forces (SDF), the backbone of which is the Kurdish YPG, became America's most reliable local ally against the armed group. The Obama administration trained, funded and equipped the Kurdish group despite strong objections from Turkey, which considers the YPG a terror organisation.\n\nA full-blown proxy war\n\nMainly as a result of the Obama administration's reluctance to act as a hegemon, Syria's conflict rapidly transformed into a full-blown proxy war. The unwillingness of the US to play a more active role in the conflict enabled regional powers - such as Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia - to step in and try to influence the course of events in Syria and the Levant at large. Russia also joined the fray in September 2015, when it became absolutely clear that the US had become utterly uninterested in the outcome of the Syrian conflict.\n\nWhen Trump moved into the White House in early 2017, despite his known disapproval of most of his predecessor's policies, and the well-known reluctance of some members of his administration to end the US military presence in the Middle East, he chose to continue with Obama's hands-off approach in the region.\n\nAnd only a year later, he expressed his intention to go even further than Obama and order a full withdrawal of US troops from Syria.\n\nTrump first announced that the US will be \"coming out of Syria, like very soon\" in March 2018. Regional allies and advisers convinced the US president that ISIL was not completely defeated, so he agreed to give the Pentagon and State Department another six months to finish the job, still refusing to commit to an open-ended military presence in Syria.\n\nImplications for Syria and the region\n\nNow that the Trump administration officially announced its intention to leave Syria for good, regional powers who have been active participants in Syria's war will likely increase their efforts to gain control of the areas that are currently under US control.\n\nAs things stand now, the US, through its Kurdish allies, controls approximately one-third of Syrian territory. These areas are justifiably dubbed by the media and analysts as \"useful Syria\": They contain Syria's major oil and gas fields, main water resources, dams, power plants and most of its fertile land.\n\nRegaining control over these territories is of vital importance for Russia. Moscow lacks the funds to sustain major reconstruction efforts in post-conflict Syria, without which its costly military achievements - defeating the opposition and securing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad - would be hollow. It also wants to be financially rewarded for its military support of the Syrian regime. Hence it had long been eyeing the oil and gas fields that are currently under US control. Now that the US is leaving, Russia will do everything necessary to be the power that fills this vacuum.\n\nIran is also interested in the US-controlled Syrian territories, albeit for completely different reasons. Since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran has been working hard to establish a \u201cShia Crescent\u201d from western Afghanistan to the Mediterranean Sea. The US withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 brought Iran one step closer towards achieving that goal. Yet, the rise of ISIL and the loss of a huge swath of territories in eastern Syria and western Iraq to the group denied Iran the possibility of keeping a land corridor open from Tehran to Damascus and to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran supported the US war on ISIL and even sought membership in the international coalition against the armed group, with the expectation that the US will leave the region once this fight is over. Now that the US is doing just that, Iran will resume its efforts to have the trans-Syria land corridor reopened by trying to increase its influence over northeast Syria.\n\nThe US decision to leave northeastern Syria will also cause problems for Israel. In September, a Russian spy plane was downed by Syrian regime forces after Israeli jets used it for cover during attacks in Syria. The incident caused Moscow to downgrade its cooperation with Israel in Syria. As a result, Tel Aviv became fully dependent on the US to keep Iran's influence in Syria in check. Following the US decision to leave Syria, Israel is now left with little leverage to shape events on the ground in Syria.\n\nSaudi Arabia also has strategic interests in the area. Over the past year, Riyadh exerted tremendous efforts to convince President Trump to maintain a substantial military presence in northeast Syria to counterbalance both Turkey and Iran. Last November, the Saudis committed $100m to convince the US to keep its troops in Syria. At one point, Riyadh even offered to send troops to patrol the area alongside the US and the YPG. Hence the US decision to leave the area likely caused major disappointment for the Saudis and encouraged them to play an even more hands-on role in the country's future.\n\nTurkey too is interested in this part of Syria. It has long accused the US-backed SDF of trying to establish an independent state in northeast Syria and has called repeatedly for the US to end its support for the Kurdish group, which it considers to be the Syrian arm of the PKK. In recent weeks, Turkey threatened to launch a major crossborder military operation to destroy its bases in Syria. Now that the US is withdrawing its troops from the region, it might be tempted to move in and eliminate the YPG as it did with Operation Olive Branch in Afrin early in the year.\n\nThis means the SDF is possibly the actor that will be most affected by the US decision to withdraw from Syria. Now that it is officially abandoned by its superpower patron, the Kurdish group will be forced to start looking for new allies to help it survive in the new political environment. Most likely, it will move closer to the Russia-Iran-Syrian regime axis to deter a Turkish military intervention.\n\nISIL might also find a window for a resurgence in the vacuum that will be created as result of Washington's exit.\n\nIn light of all this, the US withdrawal from Syria is likely to be the single most important development in the Syrian conflict since Russia's intervention in September 2015.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

"body_paragraphs": "British and French officials are scrambling to determine how they can maintain military pressure on the Islamic State terror group once the United States has pulled out its ground forces from northeast Syria.\n\nBoth countries have said they plan to continue airstrikes and ground operations in Syria, but the timing and scope of the U.S. withdrawal, say officials still reeling from President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces, remains unclear and is complicating war-planning in London and Paris.\n\nThe British and French governments are trying also to gain a clearer understanding, say officials, of Turkish military intentions in northeast Syria, and when or if the Turks, as they have threatened, launch an offensive east of the Euphrates River to attack the Western-allied Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Protection Units, or YPG.\n\nThe YPG is the main formation in the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, the West\u2019s only ground partner in the fight against IS. Turkey has been restrained from moving into Syria\u2019s Kurdish-controlled northeast in the past by the presence of U.S. troops. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would delay an offensive possibly for several months, although the Kurds say his concession shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value.\n\nPresident Erdogan has threatened to smash the Western-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria, arguing they are indistinguishable from militant Kurdish separatists in Turkey, who have waged a three-decade-long insurgency. Kurdish leaders hope Washington will continue to press the Turks to hold off. \u201cIt\u2019s their duty to prevent any attack and to put an end to Turkish threats,\u201d says Aldar Khalil, a senior Kurdish official.\n\nIn the meantime, they are renewing talks with Damascus, using the northeastern oil fields, which they control, as leverage to strike a semi-autonomy deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nA critical question for London and Paris, say defense officials in both capitals, is whether the YPG will be able to keep control of the 800 IS prisoners it holds, many from European countries.\n\nKurdish officials warned Friday French President Emmanuel Macron's representative to Syria, Fran\u00e7ois Senemand, that if Turkey does attack, it would create a chaotic situation in which they might not be able to spare the guards to make sure IS detainees are secure \u2014 let alone continue with an offensive against remaining IS formations along the border with Iraq.\n\nThe IS prisoners include two Britons accused of being members of the so-called \"Beatles\" murder cell, responsible for the torture and beheading of Western journalists and aid workers, including American reporters James Foley and Steve Sotloff.\n\nThe Kurds have long pleaded with European governments to repatriate foreign fighters to be prosecuted in their home countries, but to no avail, despite the Kurdish pleas being echoed by Washington and the families of journalists and aid workers murdered by IS.\n\nNow there\u2019s rising alarm in Western capitals that the U.S. withdrawal may trigger a chain of events that will lead to IS prisoners either escaping or being released by the Kurds, with the risk they could find their way back to the West, posing a major security headache for European governments. The Kurds say the only way to ensure their detention is for France and Britain to play a bigger military role in northern Syria. Some observers view the Kurds\u2019 warning about IS detainees as an ultimatum.\n\n\u201cUnder the threat of the Turkish state, and with the possibility of Daesh [Islamic State] reviving once again, I fear the situation will get out of control and we will no longer be able to contain them,\u201d Ilham Ahmed, a Kurdish official told reporters Friday in Paris.\n\nFrance has 200 special forces soldiers operating in Syria's Kurdish northeast as well as artillery units, part of an anti-IS international coalition trying to root out remaining pockets of militant fighters.\n\nFrench Defense Minister Florence Parly told a French radio station she disagrees with President Trump\u2019s assessment that IS has all but been annihilated.\n\n\u201cIt's an extremely grave decision and we think, the job must be finished,\u201d she said speaking three days after Trump tweeted his order for U.S. ground troops to depart Syria, declaring IS defeated. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned in protest midweek after he and other U.S. military and national security staff failed to persuade the U.S. leader to reverse his decision.\n\nOn Saturday, it emerged Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter IS, has also resigned in protest.\n\nWhen Trump made his pull-out decision, McGurk was in Iraq briefing coalition partners about how the U.S. remained committed to keeping troops in Syria, both to finish off IS and counter Iran. His departure has added to fears that without the U.S. playing a leading role the 77-nation anti-IS coalition will fall apart.\n\nBritain\u2019s defense minister has also pledged to maintain British airstrikes on IS targets in Syria, saying that although the anti-IS coalition has rolled up the militant\u2019 territorial caliphate, IS \u201cas an ideology and as an organization has become more dispersed. He warns of a possible IS resurgence. \u201cWe recognize we\u2019ve got to continue to keep a foot on the throat of Daesh,\u201d said Gavin Williamson, using an Arab acronym for IS.\n\nAs well as mounting airstrikes, British commandos have been deployed in northern Syria. They are currently engaged with American special forces alongside the SDF in the mid-Euphrates valley, where an offensive has been underway since early September against 2,000 to 8,000 IS fighters, most of whom fled from Raqqa and Mosul when those cities fell.\n\nDespite progress, including capturing the town of Hajin, the offensive there have been episodic reversals with IS mounting mobile counter-attacks under the cover of winter sandstorms and fog, say British and American officials. U.S. airstrikes have been crucial in the battle.\n\nIn October, the Kurds halted the offensive after Turkey bombarded Kurdish positions near Kobani, a town on the Turkish-Syrian border, where some of the Kurds\u2019 IS prisoners are being detained.\n\nAsked if British forces could continue to operate without considerable American military support, Williamson responded: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to look at all our options.\u201d Officials acknowledge Anglo-French options would be much reduced, if they\u2019re unable to call on U.S. air support, something that the Pentagon has so far not clarified.\n\nSome independent analysts have warned also that declaring victory over IS is premature. In a report issued last month by the International Center for Counter-Terrorism, a think tank based in The Hague, three analysts, Liesbeth van der Heide, Charlie Winter and Shiraz Maher, warned the militant group has the capacity to regroup.\n\n\u201cIts shift towards clandestine tactics has left it a more slippery foe,\u201d they argued. \u201cThe organization has now changed trajectory, its overt insurgency devolving back into covert asymmetric warfare. Now, its focus is on hit-and-run operations geared towards undermining stability and discrediting the state. These are being deployed through a careful strategy of destabilization: IS sleeper cell networks are systematically working to subvert security in liberated territories,\u201d they added in their report entitled, \u201cThe Cost of Crying Victory.\u201d\n\nSince Trump\u2019s decision, other analysts have echoed their warning. \u201cA U.S. pullout in Syria is a win for ISIS, Iran, Russia, & Assad,\u201d tweeted Mike Pregent, an analyst at the Hudson Institute, a U.S.-based think tank, and former U.S. army intelligence officer. Pregent, who\u2019s been highly critical of both Mattis and McGurk, arguing they have overseen a flawed strategy in Iraq and Syria, added: \u201cWe\u2019ll see an ISIS resurgence & a further entrenched & aggressive Iran in Syria \u2014 all before Nov 2020.\u201d\n\nBut President Trump, who has long favored a U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East, has received praise from some quarters. \u201cStaying in Syria offers grave risk for the United States with no justifying security payoff,\u201d says Kurt Couchman of Defense Priorities, a libertarian-leaning think tank. \u201cNow that the Islamic State is reduced to remnants, and local forces are committed to containing them, it is in America\u2019s interest to bring our troops home for the holidays.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "China Holds Second Vice Ministerial Call with US on Trade", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-held-second-vice-ministerial-call-with-us-on-trade/4712767.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "China and the United States held a vice ministerial-level call on Friday, the second such contact in a week, achieving a \"deep exchange of views\" on trade imbalances and the protection of intellectual property, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nA statement posted on the ministry's website on Sunday said the two countries \"made new progress\" on those issues, without specifying further.\n\nIt also said China and the United States discussed arrangements for the next call and mutual visits.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ministry said Beijing and Washington had held a vice ministerial-level telephone call about trade and economic issues, without providing other details.\n\nThe calls took place amid signs of a thaw in a trade dispute between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this month agreed to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.\n\nChinese Commerce Ministry officials indicated earlier the two countries were in close contact over trade, and any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Aide: White House, Central Bank Tension not Unusual", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-aide-white-house-central-bank-tension-not-unusual/4712931.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "A White House official says tension between a president and the interest-rate setting Federal Reserve is \"traditional as part of our system.''\n\nActing chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says it should come as no surprise that President Donald Trump is unhappy the central bank, an independent agency, \"is raising rates and we think driving down the value of the stock market.\"\n\n\n\nSpeculation about the fate of Trump's appointed Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, has swirled after Bloomberg News reported that Trump discussed firing Powell after this past week's rate increase.\n\n\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted Saturday that Trump has denied ever suggesting that and doesn't believe he has the right to dismiss Powell.\n\n\n\nMulvaney also tells ABC's \"This Week\" that the economy's \"fundamentals are still strong.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Federal Government Shutdown Enters Second Day", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-government-shutdown-enters-second-day/4712692.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. federal government entered the second day of its partial shutdown Sunday and it won't be unitl after Christmas holiday that Congress and President Donald Trump can try to agree to a resolution to their funding impasse.\n\nThe sticking point is money for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

Yet the partial shutdown of the government that began Saturday has added another threat to a growing list of risks.\n\n\n\nThe stock market's persistent fall, growing chaos in the Trump administration, higher interest rates, a U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown have combined to elevate the perils for the economy.\n\n\n\nGregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he thinks the underlying fundamentals for growth remain strong and that the expansion will continue. But he cautioned that the falling stock market reflects multiple hazards that can feed on themselves.\n\n\n\n\"What really matters is how people perceive these headwinds \u2014 and right now markets and investors perceive them as leading us into a recessionary environment,'' Daco said.\n\n\n\nMany economic barometers still look encouraging. Unemployment is near a half-century low. Inflation is tame. Pay growth has picked up. Consumers boosted their spending this holiday season. Indeed, the latest figures indicate that the economy has been fundamentally healthy during the final month of 2018.\n\n\n\nStill, financial markets were rattled Thursday by President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the government unless his border wall is funded as part of a measure to finance the government \u2014 a threat that became reality on Saturday. As tensions with the incoming Democratic House majority have reached a fever pitch, Trump warned Friday that he foresees a \"very long'' shutdown.\n\n\n\nThe expanding picture of a dysfunctional Trump administration grew further with the surprise resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis in protest of Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria \u2014 a move that drew expressions of alarm from many Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\n\n\nHow markets and government officials respond to such risks could determine whether the second-longest U.S. expansion on record remains on course or succumbs eventually to a recession.\n\n\n\nA closer look at the risks:\n\n\n\nAdministration chaos\n\n\n\nIt has been a tumultuous few days, even for a White House that has been defined by the president's daily dramas.\n\n\n\nTrump faces an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections that has led to indictments and criminal convictions of some of his closest confidants. He is coping with a wave of top staff defections, having lost both his chief of staff and defense secretary. He is in the process of installing a new attorney general.\n\n\n\nThen there is the partial government shutdown that Trump himself has pushed.\n\n\n\nThe shutdown is unlikely to hurt economic growth very much, even if it lasts awhile, because 75 percent of the government is still being funded. S&P Global Ratings estimates that each week of the shutdown would shave a relatively minuscule $1.2 billion off the nation's gross domestic product.\n\n\n\nStill, the problem is that the Trump administration appears disinclined to cooperate with the incoming House Democratic majority. So the federal support through deficit spending that boosted the economy this year will likely wane, Lewis Alexander, U.S. chief economist at Nomura, said in his 2019 outlook.\n\n\n\nThat, in part, is why the economy is widely expected to weaken from its roughly 3 percent growth this year, which would be the strongest performance since 2005.\n\n\n\nTumbling stocks\n\nStock investors have been trampled since October, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking nearly 15 percent. The plunge followed a propulsive winning streak for the stock market that began in 2009. But investors are internalizing all the latest risks, including Trump's trade war with China and higher borrowing rates, and how much they might depress corporate profits and the economy.\n\n\"Markets people are forward-looking, so they're taking into account the latest information,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\n\n\nMarkets can often fall persistently without sending the economy into a tailspin. But O'Sullivan warned of a possible feedback loop in which tumbling stock prices would erode consumer and business confidence, which in turn could send stocks sinking further. At that point, the economy would likely worsen, the job market would weaken and many ordinary households would suffer.\n\n\n\nTrade war\n\nFor economists, this may pose the gravest threat to the economy. Trump has imposed tariffs against a huge swath of goods from China, which has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. products. These import taxes tend to dampen economic activity and diminish growth.\n\n\n\n\"The trade war with China is now the biggest impediment to U.S. economic growth,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in his forecast for the first half of 2019.\n\n\n\nIn part because of the taxes Trump imposed on Chinese imports, manufacturing growth appears to be slowing, with factory owners facing higher costs for raw materials. The president has held off on further escalating tariffs to see if an agreement, or at least a lasting truce, can be reached with China by March.\n\n\n\nAny damage from trade wars tends to worsen the longer the disputes continue. So even a tentative resolution in the first three months of 2019 could remove one threat to economic growth.\n\n\n\nInterest rate hikes\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised a key short-term rate four times this year and envisions two more increases in 2019. Stocks sold off Wednesday after Chairman Jerome Powell laid out the rationale. Powell's explanation, in large part, was that the Fed could gradually raise borrowing costs and limit potential U.S. economic growth because of the job market's strength.\n\nThe Fed generally raises rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent. But inflation has been running consistently below that target.\n\n\n\nIf the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast, it could trigger the very downturn that Fed officials have been trying to avoid. This has become a nagging fear for investors.\n\n\n\nGlobal slowdown\n\n\n\nThe world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift, with many U.S. trading partners, especially in Europe and Asia, weakening or expected to expand at a slower speed. Their deflating growth can, in turn, weigh down the U.S. economy.\n\n\n\nSeveral other global risks abound. There is Britain's turbulent exit from the European Union. Italy appears close to recession and is struggling to manage its debt. China, the world's second-largest economy after the U.S., is trying to manage a slowdown in growth that is being complicated by its trade war with Trump.\n\n\n\n\"Next year is likely to be challenging for both investors and policymakers,'' Alexander, the Nomura economist, concluded in his outlook."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "States Help Run US National Parks During Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/states-help-run-us-national-parks-during-shutdown-/4712330.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. national parks will be left with just a skeleton staff during the federal government shutdown, and several states are using their own funds to make sure public restrooms get cleaned and visitor centers stay open.\n\n\n\nThe shutdown of all but essential federal services because of a Capitol Hill fight over U.S. President Donald Trump's funding demands for a Mexico border wall comes at the height of the Christmas travel season.\n\n\n\nThe National Park Service said this week that parks will remain \"as accessible as possible.\" During a three-day government shutdown in January, the gates to about two-thirds of national parks and monuments remained open.\n\n\n\n\"Services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds and full-service restrooms will not be operating,\" Jeremy Barnum, the National Park Service chief spokesman, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Republican governors of Utah and Arizona have promised to step in, in part to help protect local businesses in and around some of the country's most spectacular natural landscapes that depend on tourist spending.\n\nNot 'on our watch'\n\n\n\n\"Regardless of what happens in Washington, the Grand Canyon will not close on our watch,\" Arizona Gov.

But if we don\u2019t do the research, we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019\n\nConcerns over \u201ctheoretical harm\u201d drive decisions to exclude pregnant women from interventions, Krubiner said. But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities. But they also provide opportunities to better prepare for, and respond to, the next epidemic.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Ebola outbreaks in Congo, responders have applied lessons from West Africa\u2019s 2014-16 epidemic to community engagement. And drug trials toward the end of the West Africa outbreak produced evidence about the vaccine that\u2019s now being deployed.\n\nBut pregnant women weren\u2019t included in those trials, and researchers collected little in the way of data about the burden pregnant women and their offspring face.\n\n\u201cPregnant women are continuously getting left out of the benefits of scientific advancement in medicine,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to fail to collect the kinds of data that we need, to generate the kind of evidence that we need and to also have interventions that meet the broader population\u2019s needs,\u201d Krubiner said, \u201cthen we\u2019re just going to continue to perpetuate the cycle.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "A Small Device with a Big Impact for Blind and Visually Impaired", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/small-device-with-a-big-impact-for-blind-and-visually-impaired/4712311.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Some 1.3 billion people live with some form of vision impairment, according to the World Health Organization.

Jam their signals, others suggested.\n\nExperts say it's not that easy.\n\nBritain and the U.S. prohibit drones from being flown too high or too close to airports and other aircraft. In Britain, it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nStill, there is little to stop a drone operator bent on disrupting air traffic, which British officials say was the case with the Gatwick incident that began Wednesday evening.\n\nThe number of close calls between drones and aircraft has increased dramatically in recent years as the popularity of drones has soared. Basic models for amateurs sell for under $100; larger, more sophisticated ones can cost hundreds more.\n\nBritain had 120 reports of close encounters in 2018, up from 93 last year. In 2014, there were six, according to the U.K. Airprox Board, which catalogs air safety incidents.\n\nIn the United States, there were nearly 2,300 drone sightings at airports in the year ending June 30, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Runways have been temporarily closed, but an FAA spokesman said he could not recall drones ever leading to the shutdown of a U.S. airport.\n\nDrone dangers\n\nA drone hit a small charter plane in Canada in 2017; it landed safely. In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones. It wasn't clear what brand was used in the Gatwick incident.\n\nBritish authorities are planning to tighten regulations by requiring drone users to register, which could make it easier to identify the pilot. U.S. law already requires users to register their drones and get certified as pilots.\n\nBut Wagner warned: \"If somebody wants to do something really bad, he will never register.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "DC Sues Facebook Over Cambridge Analytica's Data Use", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/dc-sues-facebook-over-cambridge-analytica-s-data-use/4708039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "The attorney general for Washington, D.C., said Wednesday that the nation's capital had sued Facebook over reports involving Cambridge Analytica's use of data from the social media giant.\n\n\"Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data and how it was used,\" Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. \"Facebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other third-party applications to collect personal data without users' permission.\"\n\nThe lawsuit came as Facebook faced new reports that it shared its users' data without their permission.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign at one point, gained access to personal data from tens of millions of Facebook's users.

The tsunami apparently caused by the eruption of an island volcano killed a number of people around Indonesia's Sunda Strait, sending a wall of water crashing some 65 feet inland and sweeping away hundreds of houses including hotels, the government and witnesses said.\n\nThe 305-meter (1,000-foot) -high Anak Krakatau volcano, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) southwest of Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital, has been erupting since June, sometimes spewing glowing lava and tall columns of ash. In July, authorities widened its no-go areas to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the crater.\n\nHowever, Anak Krakatau remains much smaller than Krakatoa when it blew in 1883, killing more than 30,000 people. Krakatoa launched far-reaching tsunamis and created so much ash, day was turned to night in the area and a global temperature drop was recorded. The violent explosions sank most of the island into the volcanic crater under the sea, and the area remained calm until the 1920s, when Anak Krakatau began to rise from the site. It continues to grow each year and erupts periodically.\n\nGegar Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, said Saturday\u2019s tsunami was likely caused by a flank collapse \u2014 when a big section of a volcano\u2019s slope gives way. He said it\u2019s possible for an eruption to trigger a landslide above ground or beneath the ocean, both capable of producing waves.\n\n\u201cActually, the tsunami was not really big, only 1 meter (3.3 feet),\u201d said Prasetya, who has closely studied Krakatoa. \u201cThe problem is people always tend to build everything close to the shoreline.\u201d\n\nNine hotels and hundreds of homes were heavily damaged by the waves. Broken chunks of concrete and splintered sticks of wood littered hard-hit coastal areas, turning beach getaways popular with Jakarta residents into near ghost towns. Vehicles tossed by the waves remained belly-up in the rubble or were lodged in the air under collapsed roofs. Debris from thatch-bamboo shacks was strewn along beaches.\n\nIndonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and home to 260 million people, lies along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas of the disaster-prone country, making access difficult in the best of conditions.\n\nIn September, more than 2,500 people were killed by an earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, east of Borneo.\n\nSaturday\u2019s tsunami also rekindled memories of the massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake that hit Indonesia on Dec. 26, 2004. It spawned a giant tsunami off Sumatra island, killing more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries \u2014 the majority in Indonesia.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Indonesia Tsunami: At Least 62 Killed, Hundreds Injured", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesia-tsunami-sunda-strait_us_5c1ed9dde4b08aaf7a8973a3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 A tsunami apparently caused by the eruption of an island volcano killed at least 62 people after the waves hit the coast around Indonesia\u2019s Sunda Strait, sending a wall of water some 65 feet (20 meters) inland and damaging hundreds of houses including hotels, the government and witnesses said.\n\nSome 600 people have been reported injured when the tsunami hit about 9:27 p.m. Saturday, the Disaster Management Agency said.

In July, authorities widened its no-go areas to 1.24 miles (2 kilometers) from the crater.\n\nGegar Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, said the waves were likely caused by a flank collapse \u2014 when a big section of a volcano\u2019s slope gives way. He said it\u2019s possible for an eruption to trigger a landslide above ground or beneath the ocean, both capable of producing a tsunami.\n\n\u201cActually, the tsunami was not really big, only one meter,\u201d said Prasetya, who has closely studied Krakatau. \u201cThe problem is people always tend to build everything close to the shoreline.\u201d\n\nPhysical losses included 430 heavily damaged homes, nine heavily damaged hotels and 10 heavily damaged vessels. Footage posted by the head of the disaster agency showed the aftermath of flooded streets and an overturned car.\n\nIn September, more than 2,500 people were killed by a quake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, which is just east of Borneo."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "HuffPost Her Stories: Hundreds Of Women Accuse Celebrity Spiritual Healer Of Sex Crimes", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-her-stories-celebrity-spiritual-leader-brazil-sex-crimes-allegations_us_5c1d4b5ce4b0407e907ae92d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "EVARISTO SA via Getty Images Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria (center), known as \u201cJo\u00e3o de Deus,\u201d or John of God, is escorted by supporters as he arrives at his \u201chealing center\u201d Abadiania, Brazil, on Dec. 12.\n\n\u201cHuffPost Her Stories\u201d is a new series highlighting HuffPost\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s lives from across our 15 global editions. Sign up for the weekly newsletter here.\n\nDear reader,\n\nA celebrity spiritual \u201chealer\u201d with a global following was arrested in Brazil this week after hundreds of women filed reports accusing him of sexual abuse.\n\nHuffPost Brazil\u2019s Andr\u00e9a Martinelli says the country has been in shock since the first accuser spoke up on TV earlier this month, triggering an avalanche of similar complaints. Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria, known as John of God, \u201cwas a medium of prestige here in Brazil,\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. His devoted followers believed he had the power to heal through \u201cspiritual surgeries\u201d and felt betrayed and even defensive when women began accusing him of abusing them under the guise of treatment. Some people even protested in front of his spiritual retreat in solidarity with him, Andr\u00e9a added.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about this story, though, is how seriously the investigation is being taken and how quickly Faria was arrested \u2014 despite his reputation as a beloved and powerful figure. In a matter of days, more than 500 women filed complaints against Faria, leading authorities to arrest him Dec. 16 and charge him Dec. 20 with \u201csexual violation through fraud,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nHuffPost Brazil decided to make this the focus of its coverage. \u201cWe have chosen, first of all, to emphasize the importance of women\u2019s denunciations [against Faria],\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. \u201cWe know that specifically in Brazil, cases of sexual violence are underreported for a number of reasons \u2014 among them not only shame and fear, but also the fact that powerful men are involved.\u201d\n\nThe swift investigation into Faria highlights how important it is for survivors to report their abusers and the collective power of women\u2019s voices, Andrea said.\n\n\u201cI think this is the main nuance that this case brings: The voice of women strengthens the denunciations [against Faria] and provides a basis for a solid investigation against a man who, according to them, committed a series of violent acts in moments of fragility as they searched for connection with the divine.\u201d\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nCourtesy of Tila House\n\nEarlier this year, ARTnews Magazine devoted an issue to the status of women in the art world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it revealed staggering gender gaps in the prices artists fetch at auction, as well as in opportunities to show and sell work. Black women have even less of a presence in the art world, representing just 4 percent of artists at leading U.S. fine art institutions, HuffPost U.S. reported. But one artist is aiming to change that. HuffPost U.S. spoke this week with Tiffany LaTrice, the founder of an Atlanta-based arts incubator, co-working and gallery space devoted to empowering black women artists. Tila Studios is already making an impact: It raised enough money this year to send 10 black women artists to Miami\u2019s Art Basel, one of the largest commercial art fairs in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to disrupt the traditional and kind of stale industry that hasn\u2019t really seen a lot of shakeup,\u201d LaTrice said. \u201cSo [we went] down there to kind of shake things up.\u201d\n\nChatiyanon via Getty Images\n\nBoth HuffPost U.S. and HuffPost Canada reported this week on proposals that would make menstrual hygiene products available to more women who can\u2019t afford them.

The going rate for a pair of tampons in U.S. prisons is $5.55(!) \u2014 beyond what most inmates can afford, HuffPost U.S. reported. Meanwhile, in Canada, two drugstores in downtown Toronto are preparing to offer free menstrual products to homeless and low-income women. \u201cUntil 2015, Canada treated menstrual products as taxable \u2018luxury items,\u2019\u201d the article notes.

It is known for its nationalist, anti-refugee stances and condemnation of multi-culturalism.\n\nMeuthen\u2019s post riled up his followers, some of whom responded on Facebook by calling for a boycott of Toblerone because of its decision to get halal-certified.\n\nThe Arabic word \u201chalal\u201d simply means permissible. It is used by Muslims to denote items that fit within various Islamic requirements, such as restrictions against the pork-based gelatin found in some candies. Businesses that want to take advantage of the growing demand for halal foods often get their products verified by halal certification agencies. A similar process exists for businesses catering to Jewish customers who want to know that their food is certified kosher.\n\nHermann J. Knippertz/ASSOCIATED PRESS Toblerone chocolates are displayed at a Chocolate Museum in Cologne, Germany, on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2008.\n\nToblerone, a brand known for its distinctive, triangle-shaped milk chocolate bars, is owned by the American company Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. Mondel\u0113z confirmed to HuffPost in an email that its Toblerone factory in Bern, Switzerland \u2015 the only factory in the world that makes the candy \u2015 is halal-certified.\n\nMondel\u0113z spokesperson Val\u00e9rie Moens said that this certification doesn\u2019t mean Toblerone\u2019s recipe has changed. The chocolate bar\u2019s production process essentially met halal criteria even before the official certification, she said.\n\nMondel\u0113z suggested the company\u2019s decision to get halal-certified stemmed from a desire to cater to customers around the world.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to make products everyone can enjoy,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThat is why it\u2019s important to us to respond to the different preferences and food requirements of our broad range of consumers worldwide.\u201d\n\nStill, businesses\u2019 desire for halal certifications has fueled conspiracy theories among the far right about Islam\u2019s influence on European communities. Last year, the English Defence League, a far-right group in Britain, called for a boycott against Cadbury after learning that some of its chocolates were certified halal.\n\nUmar al-Qadri, technical director of the Ireland-based Department of Halal Certification, told CNN that those angered by Toblerone\u2019s decision to get certified should do more research to learn what halal really means.\n\n\u201cThey assume halal is negative when actually, it\u2019s something very positive \u2015 a higher standard of food safety.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Lehigh University Student Charged With Attempting To Murder Roommate With Poison", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-student-accused-of-poisoning-roommate_us_5c1faf4fe4b05c88b6f9ce6d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "EASTON, Pa.

Those interested in religion and spirituality have noticed that 2018 was a landmark year for the visibility of ancient natural religions, and those who are drawn to their principles and practices. Call it the Season of the Witch. While there are male witches, and always have been, the latest upsurge in witchcraft is largely a chick-and-genderfluid thing \u2015 a spiritual seeking turbocharged by affinity with the supernatural and belief in the sacred feminine and the divine androgyne.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve noticed the resurgence of interest in ethereal songwriter Stevie Nicks and \u201990s teen cult fave \u201cThe Craft,\u201d and noticed that every time you see your teenage cousin, she\u2019s walking around the house with a smudge stick of white sage and a deck of SerpentFire tarot cards wrapped in a silk scarf. Maybe you saw one of the many news reports about the hex that a group of witches placed on newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a Brooklyn occult shop.\n\nOr perhaps you\u2019ve encountered a few of the numerous articles on the mainstreaming of the witch, like Naomi Fry\u2019s piece for The New Yorker or a spate of recent Newsweek pieces. And if you\u2019re a social media creature, you\u2019ve no doubt observed that via Instagram, Twitter and especially Facebook, witches have taken messaging, organizing and education into their own hands, producing a number of witch-related gathering spots, websites, and books, books and more books. Certainly, not everyone with a pouch full of crystals and a pendulum is a witch \u2015 the #WitchesofInstagram hashtag, which is on over 2 million photos, brings up scores of pictures of practitioners who run the gamut from dabblers sharing jokey memes about being a Leo to lifelong Wiccan artists peddling their painstakingly crafted candle magick wares.\n\nSome women who might have been once attracted to yoga for solace and subtly subversive self-care are seeking stronger brew.\n\nThe modern witch, as we would recognize her today, is a mid-20th-century phenomenon, as laid out in a lovely Boston Review piece by journalist Jesse Kindig. \u201cIn their 1968 manifesto,\u201d Kindig writes, \u201cthe women\u2019s liberation activists from W.I.T.C.H. (Women\u2019s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell) proposed that \u2018A witch lives and laughs in every woman. She is the free part of each of us.\u2019 It is this history \u2015 from 1486 on \u2015 that explains today\u2019s global feminist protest chant, \u2018We are the granddaughters of all the witches you could not burn!\u2019\u201d\n\nThat such a heady sentiment \u2015 suggesting, at once, female power, resistance, wile, wisdom, mystery and no small amount of fearlessness \u2015 is finding unprecedented popularity comes as no surprise in our current cultural moment. As an archetype, the witch stands firmly with other women, yet is bowed by no man. She hews to ancient tradition without being called to conform \u2015 an untamed spirit, steeped in social responsibility, who roams free of corporatization, government interference or oppressive boy germs. The witch has always walked among us, only now she\u2019s re-emerging as a cultural and political force with an aesthetic and an agenda.\n\nNew Age, natural and alternative spiritual practices have come and gone as trends in America \u2015 tea leaves, astrology, palmistry, s\u00e9ance parties, telephone psychics and mass-market Ouija boards. In the 1990s, yoga exploded as a means of transformation and restoration and engagement with the higher self, but over the years, it has assumed a seriously Range Rover Lululemon bougie vibe (not to mention troubling issues of cultural appropriation, ectomorph-worship, ableism and a glaring sheen of whiteness). So some women who might have once been attracted to yoga for solace and subtly subversive self-care are seeking stronger brew.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images A metaphysical book store in Brooklyn, New York gathered witches, Wiccans and locals to perform a hex ritual on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and Senator Mitch McConnell.\n\nOf course, as it ever must be under capitalism, big business has pegged Paganism and witches as a trend and tried to slap its slimy profit-seeking tentacles on those pentacles. Pop culture has its place as a message-bearer by which many future witches are first exposed to the craft. Says practicing witch Sara Coughlin in a piece published in Refinery29: \u201cWhere now we have The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, American Horror Story: Coven, and a Charmed reboot, I grew up with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Craft, and Practical Magic.\u201d\n\nBut the commercialization of ritual items has proved a bridge too far. Sephora caused an uproar in September when it announced a plan to market and sell a Starter Witch Kit, which, to a serious Wiccan or Yoruba practitioner, must feel akin to sacrilege. Can you imagine, say, Hallmark stocking a beginner\u2019s baptism kit? (Undaunted, Allure magazine stepped into the beauty biz witch void by offering an article on color magick, with corresponding links to yellow Versace perfume, red Yves Saint Laurent lipstick, black Origins charcoal mask and the like.)\n\nAt heart, the current surge in witchcraft among American women and femmes is about the power of female healing and uprising in a world that seeks, in every way, to harm us and tamp us down.\n\nNot surprisingly, the media focus on witches features white women almost exclusively (insert requisite \u201cbasic witch\u201d joke here) but this white-washing, while predictable, is misleading. Witches of color abound, practicing within a number of traditions, including Santeria, Wicca, Yoruba and Hoodoo, or a combination thereof. The illumination of traditions and customs, and the cultures from which they come, is feminist intersectionality at its best. Despite the mainstream media oversight, women of color have staked out a significant place on social media platforms and blogs. If you like to follow your Instagram healers but you don\u2019t follow the ravishing sisterly warmth of The Hood Witch and the uplifting meme wizardry of astrologer Chani Nicolas, you\u2019re missing out.\n\nThe appeal of the witch is intersectional also, in that it transcends generational lines. Archetypally, the crone is the ultimate moral arbiter, healer and power broker. As Gloria Steinem famously said, \u201cWomen are the only demographic that gets more radical as it ages.\u201d Small wonder older women would be witches \u2015 it\u2019s one of the few pursuits in which women accrue more relevance as they mature, rather than being remanded to has-been status once they\u2019ve moved past their years of peak fertility, beauty and malleability. And despite the media focus on witches as a millennial trend, the women whom they most look up to have been practicing in this space for decades.\n\nAs it ever was, the public reaction and pop culture renderings of witches is threaded with suspicion and darkness, favoring a fascination with white girls doing dark arts and black magic. Coughlin described this dynamic: \u201cModern day witchcraft to me is about good vibes, self-empowerment and girl power. I have been practicing for as long as I can remember, my own witchcraft is all about self-care, empowering yourself and spreading cosmic vibes. The stereotypes of witchcraft that we often see in TV and film make me cringe and my defense mechanisms start to go in to overdrive as the clich\u00e9s of power hungry, evil, hexing, pointy hat wearing, devil worshipping, blood sucking witches roll in \u2015 this formula gives witches a bad name.\u201d\n\nGiving witches a bad name is as old as the hallowed hills, a social ill many witches attribute to misogyny and ingrained resentment of women\u2019s autonomy. Yet curiously, powerful men who feel the sting of scrutiny are quick to liken their plight to a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d (for example, President Donald Trump and men who have been named by accusers in the Me Too movement). Note: Being called out for your bullshit, corruption and treachery is not persecution. Let us not confuse being summoned to account with victimhood. Nice try, fellas.\n\nAt heart, the current surge in witchcraft among American women and femmes is about the power of female healing and uprising in a world that seeks, in every way, to harm us and tamp us down. What may look, to some, like a momentary dip into dark water is really an earnest search for the light."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Capital Gazette Staffer Says Security 'A Daily Concern' Even In Secret Newsroom Location", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/capital-gazette_us_5c1f47d7e4b05c88b6f979da", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "More than five months after a mass shooting left five dead inside the Capital Gazette\u2019s office in Annapolis, Maryland, one staffer said safety remains a constant worry, even though the newsroom\u2019s location is now unknown to the public.\n\nIn a Friday interview on NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered,\u201d photojournalist Joshua McKerrow said employees are \u201cnever going back to the old newsroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a temporary location in Annapolis, a secret location, if you can believe that,\u201d he added.\n\nEven so, McKerrow acknowledged that \u201csecurity is a daily concern for the newsroom.\u201d\n\nThe June 28 shooting killed the Capital\u2019s Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith, and Wendi Winters, all of whom were remembered when Time Magazine honored the outlet\u2019s staff with its 2018 Person of the Year title, along with other journalists who\u2019ve been targeted around the world for their work.\n\nMcKerrow called the recognition \u201ca great and terrible honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d give every bit of it back \u2013 every bit of attention, every \u2013 everything back just to have them, just to be able to come in again and argue about our assignments and bicker and share cookies at Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we could have Rebecca and Wendi and Gerald and Rob and John back, we\u2019d give it all back in a second.\u201d\n\nThe Capital\u2019s staffers were slain when a gunman entered the building and opened fire, possibly looking for revenge in a long-standing feud the alleged culprit had with the paper, reports suggest.\n\nStill, McKerrow told NPR \u201cwe couldn\u2019t be silenced ... we could not be intimidated by rhetoric or violence,\u201d noting that no employees have left the paper."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Outrage After Louis C.K., Chris Rock Laugh Over N-Word Jokes In Old Video", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/louis-ck-chris-rock_us_5c1f27b2e4b08aaf7a8988ca", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Old footage of Louis C.K. and Chris Rock exchanging N-word jokes was uncovered Saturday, spreading like wildfire across social media and triggering outrage.\n\nThe 2011 \u201cTalking Funny\u201d clip shows the two comedians sitting with Jerry Seinfeld and Ricky Gervais as C.K. says, \u201cwhen a black guy gets rich, it\u2019s countdown to when he\u2019s poor again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the blackest white guy I fucking know,\u201d Rock replies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m a n****r?\u201d C.K. asks.\n\n\u201cYes, you are the n****rest fucking white man I have ever\u201d met, Rock says, to the amusement of both C.K. and Gervais.\n\nSeinfeld, who looks uneasy, interjects with \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use it anywhere,\u201d appearing to refer to the derogatory term.\n\nC.K. then boasts, \u201cwe say n****r on stage,\u201d referring to himself and Rock.\n\nAfter the video was posted online, it sparked a mix of shock and backlash on Twitter, where some users praised Seinfeld for not taking part in the slur tossing.\n\nWhat was Chris Rock thinking? \u2014 deray (@deray) December 22, 2018\n\nI'm sorry.

Sick students need to stay stay home and miss school. And doctor\u2019s notes verifying a student is sick and unable to attend class have become as elusive and rare as one of Willy Wonka\u2019s infamous golden tickets for millions of children in America.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. (in which adequate health care is far from an easily accessible human right), it\u2019s ridiculous that students are still required to provide a note from a medical practitioner to receive an excused absence. Such policies disproportionality affect economically disadvantaged youth and youth of color and serve as yet another reminder that our educational and medical systems are designed to set certain students up for failure.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are often synonymous in America \u2015 1 in 3 black, Native American and Hispanic children live in poverty, compared to 1 in 10 white children. Children who live in poverty are more likely to go uninsured than children who don\u2019t, and the total number of uninsured young people in America is on the rise.\n\nFor the 3.9 million children living without health care coverage, the very ability to go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick and to get \u201cpermission\u201d to miss school is little more than a dream. And while many uninsured children qualify for some type of government coverage, their ability to obtain that coverage is often out of their hands. Parents who lack coverage for themselves (for any variety of reasons) are often unfamiliar with the inner workings of America\u2019s health care system and therefore don\u2019t know how to seek government assistance for their kids.\n\nThe necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents.\n\nMedicaid is often depicted as the be-all, end-all answer for those who can\u2019t afford health care, but Medicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI was raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, and as a young child, I received Medicaid coverage. As my family transitioned into different income brackets, I lost that coverage and went without health insurance entirely when my mother made enough money to keep food on the table and gas in the car but made too much to qualify for government assistance. Once we could afford our own private health insurance coverage, we were still often unable to afford the copays and out-of-pocket expenses necessary to utilize the medical system. Our story is just one of many like it.\n\nEven students who do have adequate health care coverage (and can therefore obtain one of those elusive doctor\u2019s notes to excuse their school absences) are ultimately reliant on other factors outside of their control when they need to see a physician. Many times, a simple cold, stomachache or other illness can be cured with home remedy and rest. The necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents whose work situation doesn\u2019t give them the flexibility to accompany their kid to the doctor.\n\nIf a parent\u2019s schedule does allow for a trip to the physician, the high cost of copays, deductibles and prescriptions mean many Americans must scrape together what should\u2019ve been that week\u2019s grocery, gas or electric bill money just to provide their child\u2019s school with a slip of paper. And this doesn\u2019t even take into account the inherent assumption that all parents have access to private or public transportation, a luxury many often take for granted. For 45 percent of the American population, public transit is nonexistent where they live.\n\nMedicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI know from experience that for families in situations like these \u2015 who lack adequate health care or who are barely able to afford the coverage they do have \u2015 a certain set of criteria must be met before going to see the doctor for one of those notes. How bad does it hurt? Is it broken? Is your temperature \u201ctoo high\u201d? Depending on the answers, we either stayed home or went to school anyway.\n\nThis is the kind of criteria we\u2019ve forced upon economically disadvantaged youth. Kids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter if a child has unexcused absences? What\u2019s the big deal? Schools often create their own policies as to what qualifies as an excused or unexcused absence. If an administration decides a missed class for health reasons without a note from a physician is \u201cunexcused,\u201d it can impact students\u2019 grades; many teachers take these absences into consideration when calculating a student\u2019s overall letter grade. And in many districts across America, if a student has unexcused absences, they lose the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and sports as punishment.\n\nIn more extreme cases, students with multiple unexcused absences over an extended period of time are considered truant. This can leave parents facing hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of truancy fines and even time behind bars. Penalties like these have a far greater negative impact on youth who already come from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nKids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nWe have a misconception here in America that children have access to health care via their school nurse, and that the nurse can excuse a child\u2019s absence based on their own diagnosis. While this does happen, not all students have access to this kind of care; only about 82 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have full- or part-time nurses on staff (the number is even lower for private institutions). Students who can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note and who don\u2019t have access to a school nurse find themselves in a lose-lose situation when it comes to their attendance record.\n\nDoctor\u2019s note policies have no place in our K-12 schools. We shouldn\u2019t punish America\u2019s children for being denied their basic human right to health care (or for having parents without the financial means to take advantage of the health care they do possess).\n\nWhat we need are policies that are empathetic toward our country\u2019s economically disadvantaged youth. If a parent says their child\u2019s absence is health-related, that absence should be considered excused \u2015 case closed. And because these policies are determined by local educational agencies, changes will only come via discussion at a local level \u2015 school boards, parent-teacher associations, town hall meetings and other public forums.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are already perpetually discriminated against in America\u2019s schools. The least our educational system can do is remove one stressor from the equation.\n\nUntil then, doctor\u2019s notes will continue to provide opportunity and access only to those who can afford it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Health Care In Texas Is A Nightmare For Women Restaurant Workers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-restaurant-workers-sexual-health-care_us_5c1a7690e4b0446830f95b5c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Emily Jaschke Texas is one of the worst states for reproductive health.

The group\u2019s footprint is small, but it offers resources to women in an area where the need is great.\n\nIHWSH has helped its nearly 200 members, all of whom are women in the restaurant industry, access free gynecological exams. \u201c[Exams] are typically not covered under insurance,\u201d Smith said, adding, \u201ca lot of the women are not provided insurance through employment, and most don\u2019t have insurance on their own.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the group raised and donated more than $210,000 to local organizations that prioritize women\u2019s health, including Planned Parenthood and The Rose, which provides breast cancer detection and treatment services to reduce deaths by the disease.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we become sexually active, we have very few healthcare paths as women. We are either actively preventing pregnancy, not actively preventing pregnancy, actively trying to conceive, or pregnant,\u201d Smith wrote in an essay for Food and Wine. \u201cBecause of this reality, more women are driven away from fields that do not provide easier and more affordable access to healthcare and other valuable resources.\u201d\n\nSmith gained a new level of understanding for her cause in 2018, when she learned she was pregnant. She\u2019s fortunate to be the owner of her restaurant, she said, because it allowed her to come up with a viable maternity leave plan for herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very healthy pregnancy, but that\u2019s not the norm for everybody,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIf there\u2019d been something that went wrong where the doctor put me on bedrest, I really don\u2019t know what we would have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month,\u201d she told HuffPost in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to the doctor all the time now. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s something a lot of restaurants are able and willing to accommodate. The restaurant industry in general is made up of mom-and-pop small businesses. You can\u2019t put all the onus on the employer \u2014 there needs to be some help from the government so small businesses can accommodate.\u201d\n\nFeges BBQ does not provide its employees with an insurance policy, but Smith said that if one of her employees becomes pregnant, she would do everything she could to be supportive, including offering paid leave.\n\n\u201cWe would try to work something out to offer some paid time off but would need to guarantee they\u2019d come back,\u201d she said, adding that she would offer both maternity and paternity leave. \u201cIf any of the guys in our business have a baby, we would want to give them some time off, too, because they\u2019re a critical part of the parenting process.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said that the lack of women\u2019s resources puts them at a severe disadvantage, including in their ability to climb the corporate ladder. Without a proper system in which women can be both parents and professionals, this won\u2019t change, she said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see women in leadership positions in this business or other industries \u2014 unless women make the decision not to have families. And that\u2019s not fair.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "2018's Most Horrific Sign Of Things To Come Was People With Disabilities Dying In Disasters", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-2018-disasters-climate-change-disabilities_us_5c1bc563e4b0407e90784909", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "To mark the end of 2018, we asked writers to revisit some of the year\u2019s most noteworthy (for good or evil) events, people and ideas. See the other entries here between now and the new year.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Jim Knaver and his wife, Anna Hastings (known as Toni), spotted a little smoke in the air from their home in Paradise, California. They knew the risks of fire and had diligently cleared any flammable debris from their property. Jim checked the news for fire danger, he later told NPR, then drove to teach his fourth-grade class. Toni was disabled and didn\u2019t drive, which was a concern, but the couple planned to stay in touch and figured Jim could just drive back if she needed to evacuate. Later that morning, the Camp Fire roared through Paradise at unprecedented speed. Without transportation or even the means to flee on foot, Toni couldn\u2019t get out. Jim lost touch over the phone around 11 a.m. Five days later, search teams confirmed they had found Toni\u2019s remains.\n\nWe live in an era of flood and fire. That disasters like the Camp Fire and the devastating hurricanes that have struck the U.S. in recent years are more frequent and more severe because of human-caused climate change is an indisputable scientific fact. Unless something changes, as the waters rise and the air grows thick with smoke, as medicines run out and food systems collapse, as higher, wetter, or more fertile ground becomes the only resource that matters, millions of people like Toni \u2015 millions of poor and non-wealthy, elderly, people with disabilities \u2015 are going to die.\n\nThere has never been a threat to humanity quite like catastrophic climate change. First, while most great disasters spring upon us quickly, we\u2019ve known the threat has been coming for almost 200 years. Second, we now have the technology to ameliorate the worst of the consequences, which is again unprecedented in human history. We couldn\u2019t have stopped the Black Death, for example, but the decarbonization of society is possible. Instead, year after year, things get worse, and we still do nothing. Yes, we have solar panels and wind farms, but the rate of fossil fuel use is projected to rise through 2040, and 2018 had the highest level of global carbon emission in history. The green technology thus far deployed will have no more effect than pouring a thimbleful of water on a raging blaze.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWhen the worst happens, disabled people will die first. The problems extend far beyond wheelchair users who cannot physically evacuate through inaccessible areas. For example, I am mentally disabled. Without access to psychiatric medication, I wonder whether I could stave off suicidal ideation in the face of local climate collapse. Think about all the people who require insulin, chemotherapy, specialized nourishment pumped into their stomach, or people who can\u2019t access a shelter because it has no ramp or because crowds make them panic. The threats extend across categories.\n\nIn November, Alice Wong, a Bay Area resident and global disability justice leader, wrote about receiving air quality alerts as smoke from the fires more than 160 miles away made it dangerous to go outside. She knew she was privileged to stay home with her air purifier but rightly worried for those with lung-related conditions who lacked homes, access to masks, or other medical support.\n\nMarcie Roth, former FEMA official and currently CEO of the National Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, tells me there\u2019s been a \u201cfailure to plan. And a failure to meet the equal access requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe climate change adaptation folks are not really talking to the disaster risk reduction folks who are not really talking to the humanitarian relief folks who are not really talking to the CRPD [U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities] folks who are not really talking to the strategic development/plan folks,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much siloing going on.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Roth argued that lack of planning for inclusive disaster relief puts everyone at risk, writing, \u201cA resilient community will plan for \u2013 and with \u2013 all of its members.\u201d\n\nWe can fix this. Not only can we focus our disaster responses on the most vulnerable people, but we can elect representatives who are willing to say the word, \u201cdecarbonization.\u201d As the 2020 Democratic Primary begins (it\u2019s already begun), who will be brave enough to speak up for those already being killed by climate change? To lead us out of the fire and floods?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg Voted From Hospital To Block Trump Asylum Restrictions", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-bder-ginsburg-shoots-down-trump-asylum-restrictions-in-vote-from-hospital_us_5c1dd1fbe4b08aaf7a88eb60", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted against President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed immigrant asylum restrictions from the hospital where she had cancer surgery Friday, according to media reports.\n\nNBC reported that Ginsburg voted from her hospital bed.

A 7-month-old baby reportedly choked on the beads of a wooden teething bracelet and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risks we\u2019ve observed with these products and want parents to be aware that teething jewelry puts children, including those with special needs, at risk of serious injury and death,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., said in a statement.\n\nThe beads of teething jewelry may be made of silicone, wood, or other materials, including amber. The manufacturers of amber teething necklaces claim that a baby\u2019s body temperature warms the amber, releasing a pain-relieving chemical that can be absorbed through their skin to relieve teething pain.\n\nAnd indeed, that chemical, called succinate or succinic acid, has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits. But the FDA has not tested the necklace manufacturers\u2019 claims for safety or effectiveness.\n\nPetardj via Getty Images Teething rings can pose a severe hazard, according to the FDA.\n\nDr. Jaime Friedman, a San Diego-based pediatrician, praised the FDA for issuing the warning. Friedman says that parents rarely ask for her advice on these teething necklaces before they buy one for their baby, but she frequently sees patients wearing them during appointments.\n\nFriedman makes it a point to counsel caregivers away from using them by bringing up choking and strangulation risks, as well as the unknown effects about the amber itself.\n\n\u201cI have not, as of yet, seen that there\u2019s any evidence of [succinic] acid in the bloodstream,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you do have this acid in the bloodstream, do we know what it\u2019s doing? No, I don\u2019t think we do.\u201d\n\nFriedman, who is an official spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics and affiliated with Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group, said that if parents insist on using the necklaces, she advises them to not let babies wear them unsupervised. That means no jewelry while they sleep, or while sitting in a car seat if an adult can\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s unsolicited advice, but hey, that\u2019s my job right? To protect kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has taken a strong stance against other at-home teething pain remedies, including numbing gels or creams for gums, as well as homeopathic teething tablets that were found to contain belladonna, a poisonous plant that can be dangerous to people.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caregivers give their babies a teething ring that has been chilled in the fridge to numb the pain. However, it warns against freezing teething rings, as frozen rings can damage gums. Another safe option for caregivers would be for them to use a clean finger to gently rub or massage their baby\u2019s gums."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump, Angry Over Mattis\u2019s Rebuke, Removes Him 2 Months Early", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/politics/trump-mattis.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Sunday that he would remove Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who issued a stinging rebuke of the president when he announced his resignation last week, from his post by Jan. 1, two months before he had planned to depart.\n\nMr. Trump, in a Twitter post, said that Patrick M.

that hit the coast \u2014 was caused by an undersea landslide that was set off by volcanic activity on the island of Anak Krakatau."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link":

on Sumatra and Java in Indonesia late Saturday is a reminder that such destructive waves are not always caused by earthquakes.\n\nThis disaster, which struck without warning and killed at least 222 people and injured more than 800 others, appeared to have been caused by volcanic activity.\n\nNo earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said. But there had been an eruption on the volcanic island of Anak Krakatau about half an hour before, they said, one of a series of eruptions there in recent weeks.\n\nTsunamis are created when large amounts of water \u2014 in the ocean, a bay or even a lake \u2014 are quickly displaced. In an earthquake, that displacement can occur when the ground moves as a fault breaks.\n\nThis was the mechanism by which a 9.1 magnitude earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, off Aceh Province in northern Indonesia, spawned large waves that traveled across the Indian Ocean and killed 225,000 people.\n\nMany other tsunamis have also followed earthquakes, including those in September that devastated the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude quake.\n\n[See images from Indonesia after the latest tsunami to strike the country.]\n\nVolcanic activity creates a tsunami differently. One possibility is an explosive eruption, or general weakening of the flanks of a volcano by hot magma passing through. Either way, part of the volcano \u2014 perhaps, in the case of Anak Krakatau, a part that is underwater \u2014 can collapse, creating a landslide that displaces water.\n\nAnother possible mechanism is the collapse of a magma chamber below the volcano as it empties during an eruption.\n\nVolcano-related tsunamis are not uncommon. An eruption in 1792 in Japan created waves that were several hundred feet high. Landslides during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington spawned large waves in a lake nearby.\n\nPerhaps the most famous volcanic disaster in history, the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, also called Krakatoa, triggered tsunamis that killed tens of thousands of people. (Anak Krakatau island has built up in place of Krakatau, which was obliterated in the 1883 event.)\n\nLandslides hitting water can sometimes create huge waves. The largest wave ever recorded was caused by a landslide into Lituya Bay, in southeast Alaska, in July 1958. It followed an earthquake, not an eruption, but created a wave that wiped vegetation off the hillside on the opposite side of the bay.\n\nA United States Geological Survey geologist, measuring the scouring marks, determined that the height of the wave had been more than 1,700 feet."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "\u2018Damaged\u2019 Drone Found Near Gatwick; Arrested Couple Are Freed Without Charge", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/world/europe/gatwick-airport-drones.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "LONDON \u2014 A married couple in Britain who were detained in connection with the illegal use of drones that sowed three days of chaos at Gatwick Airport were released on Sunday without charge, and the police said they had recovered a \u201cdamaged\u201d drone near the airport that was being forensically examined.\n\nGatwick Airport also announced that it was offering a 50,000-pound reward (about $63,000) for information leading to \u201cthe arrest and conviction of those responsible for the criminal act that disrupted flights.\u201d\n\nThe couple had been arrested on suspicion of disrupting civil aviation services and endangering people or operations, the police said in a statement.

Genomics, for example, looks at molecules related to the operations of genes; metabolomics at those involved in our metabolisms, and so on.\n\nBut one of the more compelling \u2019omics fields is proteomics, because it focuses on proteins, which are expressed by genes and subsequently jump-start countless other physiological processes throughout our bodies.\n\nProteins are at the heart of our busy interior biology.\n\nBut almost nothing has been known about the proteomics of people who exercise and whether and how they might differ from those of people who rarely move and what it might mean if they do.\n\nSo, for the new study, which was published in November in the Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, set out to look at various people\u2019s proteins.\n\nThey first gathered 31 healthy young men and women, about half of whom exercised regularly, while the rest did not. They also recruited an additional group of 16 healthy middle-aged and older men, half of whom were physically active and half of whom were sedentary."}]
