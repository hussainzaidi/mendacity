But after speaking with him, they decided not to detain him under laws that allow for the temporary detention of people with psychiatric issues.\n\nSeven months later, officers swarmed his home again for a very different reason: a mass shooting.\n\nLong was identified by police on Thursday as the gunman who killed 12 people and injured more than a dozen more in a sudden spree of violence at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks.\n\nSurvivors of the shooting said the gunman, dressed in black and wearing glasses, shot a security guard outside and then shot a young woman working at the counter just inside the door before opening fire on others.\n\nOne of the victims , Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus , was fatally shot when he entered the bar and tried to stop the rampaging gunman, Dean said.\n\nPolice then regrouped and, after waiting for reinforcements, were able to enter the bar. Inside, they found Long dead of what Dean said he believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nOne handgun, a legally purchased .45-caliber Glock, was found at the scene. The weapon usually holds 10 rounds, plus another in the chamber, but the gunman used an extended magazine in the shooting, Dean said.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor to the bar\n\nOn Thursday morning, Dean said he did not know of the shooter's motive, and he did not know of any connection between Long and the Borderline bar.\n\nBut friends told CNN that Long frequently visited the bar.\n\nPolice identified Ian David Long as the gunman in the mass shooting.\n\n\"We would go to Borderline together. He really liked it,\" said one woman who has been friends with Long for five years and does not want her name made public.\n\n\"I would make fun of him, because he would drag me there. Sometimes we'd go there to have a drink, sit and talk, listen to music,\" she said.\n\nBorderline, a Western-themed establishment known to regularly host country, salsa and swing dancing nights, was hosting a college country night on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"There was a community there. He was a part of that community. The whole bar is line dancing. People do choreographed dances for hours, cowboy boots and hats in the middle of the suburbs of Thousand Oaks,\" the friend said.\n\nA person who was a childhood friend of Long's until their early 20s and who does not want their name revealed publicly similarly said they used to go to Borderline together. The friend expressed shock that Long would do such a thing.\n\n\"I don't know what the hell happened. He was always happy. I never thought this would ever come from him. We used to go snowboarding all the time. He was a good guy,\" the friend said.\n\nA third friend who does not want to be publicly identified said Long stopped communicating two years ago but said the shooting was unlike him.\n\n\"He wasn't unhinged, he wasn't violent. He was a sweet guy who served his country and was using his GI Bill to go to college and get a degree to help more people,\" the friend said. \"Out of our group of friends I thought the highest of him. This is just horrible and I'm so sorry for the victims and his family.\"\n\nHe was in the Marine Corps\n\nThe gunman was on active duty with the US Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013, according to Defense Department records.\n\nHe posted information about his military service on a special forces forum called ShadowSpear in March 2017.\n\nUnder the name \"doorkicker03,\" Long said he had served in Afghanistan, was an infantry machine gunner in the Marine Corps for 4\u00bd years, and was an instructor in Okinawa in Japan.\n\nDepartment of Defense records show he was a corporal and went to Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011.\n\nThomas Burke, a pastor who served with Long in the same US Marine Corps regiment, said Long's battalion arrived during intense fighting in Helmand province.\n\nBut Burke warned against too quickly blaming Long's actions on trauma experienced during war.\n\n\"PTSD doesn't create homicidal ideation,\" Burke said. \"We train a generation to be as violent as possible, then we expect them to come home and be OK. It's not mental illness. It's that we're doing something to a generation, and we're not responding to the needs they have.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Marines in 2013, Long went to college in California.\n\n\"I am graduating with a B.S. in Athletic Training in two months,\" he wrote in his ShadowSpear post. \"I found out a little too late that just wasn't the job for me. Maybe the ego got the better of me but it took only one time for a 19-year-old D-2 athlete to talk down to me and tell me how to do my job that I realized this wasn't the career I wanted to head.\"\n\nLong did not complete his degree. He was a student at California State University, Northridge, majoring in athletic training from 2013 to 2016, but he did not graduate, university representative Carmen Ramos Chandler said.\n\nLong also went to the College of the Canyons for two spring semesters, according to that school.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Mass shooting at California bar Molly Esterline is hugged by David Crawford on the scene of a shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, on Thursday, November 8.

The couple separated in 2011 and dissolved the marriage in April 2013 in Ventura County, California. He and his then-wife said they had no children and owned no property.\n\nA settlement agreement stated, \"Irreconcilable differences have caused the irremediable breakdown of our marriage.\"\n\nHe started firing suddenly\n\nThe gunman was dressed in black and wearing glasses when he walked into the bar filled with people enjoying a night of line dancing.\n\n\"I started hearing these big pops.

There are no indications Long was working with any associates, he said.\n\nA neighbor said Long's mother \"lived in fear\" of what her son might do, saying when police were called to the house earlier this year \"it took them about a half a day to get him out of the house.\"\n\nNeighbor Richard Berge said Long's mother told him she was concerned about her son, though not worried about her own safety, and that \"she was ... kind of beside herself, she didn't know what to do because he wouldn't get help.\"\n\nBerge said when he saw police activity at the house on Thursday morning, \"I knew what it was.\"\n\nAnother neighbor, Gareth Crites, said he rarely saw Long at the house.

We think it's going fine.\"\n\nTrump had been asked about the administration's announcement, in the middle of the night as Tuesday's midterm elections results were coming in, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Thursday meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been postponed.\n\n\"We're very happy with how it's going with North Korea. We think it's going fine. We're in no rush. We're in no hurry,\" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference. \"The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes are home.\"\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told lawmakers in Seoul Tuesday that she was told the North Koreans asked the US to postpone the talks, citing their busy schedules. A senior US official told CNN the North Korean delegation called Tuesday to postpone the meeting, but did not offer a clear explanation.\n\nAnother source familiar with the US-North Korea talks and familiar with North Korean thinking said Pyongyang canceled because it came to the conclusion that it wasn't going to get anywhere with working level talks -- either through the Washington's special representative for North Korea, Stephen E. Biegun, or through Pompeo himself.\n\n'A standoff'\n\nUS military officials, foreign diplomats and sources familiar with developments say the two sides are locked in a standoff over who will make concessions first, that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is \"really angry\" about the US refusal to offer sanctions relief and that personal friction between US and North Korean negotiators may be slowing progress.\n\n\"It doesn't bode well for the negotiations, which were already not proceeding well,\" said Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nA former CIA deputy division chief for Korea, Klingner pointed to North Korea's recent threat to restart \"building up nuclear forces\" if the US didn't ease sanctions, the fact that Pyongyang has yet to meet Pompeo's Special Representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, and that the two countries still haven't agreed on the definition of basic terms such as \"denuclearlization\" -- five months after Trump's historic summit with Kim.\n\n\"Clearly the two sides remain very far apart,\" Klingner said.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang said that North Korea is \"getting really angry\" over the lack of any offer of sanctions relief from the US and that their stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nNorth Korea's state media outlet KCNA said November 2: \"We gave all things possible to the US, things it hardly deserves, by taking proactive and good-will measures, what remains to be done is the US corresponding reply. Unless there is any reply, the DPRK will not move even 1 mm, how costly it may be.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED US cancels military exercise with South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US cancels military exercise with South Korea 01:34\n\nThe US has suspended and canceled military exercises with South Korea in the interests of diplomacy. And Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford hinted Monday that if there's progress in US-North Korea talks, it could lead to a potential change in the US military presence on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 troops are currently stationed -- a long-held goal for Pyongyang.\n\n\"Frankly the more successful we are on the diplomatic track the more uncomfortable we'll be in the military space,\" Dunford said at an event at Duke University, \"because over time, this negotiation will take a form where we're going to have to start making some changes to the military posture on the peninsula and we're prepared to do that in support of Secretary Pompeo.\"\n\nCNN military and diplomatic analyst John Kirby noted that Dunford \"tried to reflect the basic fact that US military force posture on the peninsula is both a cause of the tension and a result. It is necessary because it's necessary, not just because it's always been there.\"\n\n\"As such, the military plays a key role in the diplomatic process, as bulwark and as bargaining chip,\" Kirby noted. \"Had Dunford not admitted some sort of change in force posture might ensue from successful talks, he might have condemned those very talks to failure.\"\n\n'Largely cosmetic'\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\n\"There has been a move away from past administrations' approach to North Korea in terms of 'we will give you a little here if you give us a little there' ... kind of a tit-for-tat piece ... we haven't seen that work in the past, so the President is insistent on holding the full pressure campaign until he gets the full denuclearization,\" a US official told CNN.\n\nThe official added that one of the concerns right now is that making sure the rest of the world, and particularly South Korea, maintain full pressure on Pyongyang. \"I think it is a concern that South Korea gets ahead of that,\" the official said.\n\nIt's a problem, not just because Trump's summit with Kim opened the door for other world leaders to meet with the North Koreans, eroding Pyongyang's diplomatic isolation, but South Korea, along with China and Russia, have been pushing for the US to ease sanctions on the DPRK.\n\nIn the meantime, Pyongyang's threats over the weekend to restart its nuclear program have also increased tensions, according to the sources familiar with the exchanges between the US and North Korea. They also say that personal friction between negotiators has been a problem.\n\nThe US side sees the North Korean general charged with leading negotiations, Kim Yong Chol, as \"difficult and old-fashioned\" in negotiations and would prefer\u200e to work with someone else.\n\nA US defense official told CNN that part of the problem is that in the US view, Kim Yong Chol remains a hardliner and may be increasingly difficult for the US to deal with.\n\n'Early next year'\n\nOn Wednesday, State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino claimed that the canceled meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol was simply a \"scheduling issue.\"\n\n\"This is purely a matter of scheduling,\" Palladino said repeatedly when asked about the delay at the press briefing Wednesday. \"Schedules change,\" he said. \"Schedules change all of the time, in fact.\"\n\nPressed by reporters whether talks with Pyongyang had reached an impasse over differing demands from both Washington and Pyongyang, Palladino said the talks were in \"a pretty good place\" and scheduling of meetings would not be driven by \"artificial timelines,\" and the two sides \"will continue to make progress.\"\n\nThe deputy spokesman said the State Department was confident that inspectors would be allowed to examine North Korea's nuclear facilities.\n\nTwo other senior US defense officials say Washington's assessment remains that Kim is still aiming for denuclearization, but some of the slow roll is due to his need to bring his own \"elites\" into line.\n\nThese officials say this has continued to be an issue for the North Korean leader, which may account for Trump's public patience. The officials also say North Korea is likely to make some initial denuclearization declarations that won't be accurate or truthful, but the US thinks it can work around that.\n\nTrump also said he would meet with Kim \"sometime next year, sometime early next year\" and said Pompeo's trip schedule had changed because \"of trips that are being made. We're going to make it on another date.\" Neither the National Security Council nor the State Department was able to offer an explanation for the other trips Trump referred to."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "French Bishops launch 'independent' commission on sex abuse in Catholic Church", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/jqeVz9z4sgY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:34:37", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) French bishops have announced plans to establish an \"independent\" commission to look into the sexual abuse of minors within the Catholic Church dating back as far as 1950.\n\nThe appointed panel would \"seek to understand the reasons which led to the way these cases were handled\" by the Church, the Conference of French Bishops said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe conference pledged to publish a report outlining the commission's findings within two years.

The finding is the first technical problem revealed as part of the investigation into why the plane crashed.\n\n\"We are formulating, with the NTSB (US National Transportation Safety Board) and Boeing, detailed inspections regarding the airspeed indicator,\" said Tjahjono, on Tuesday.\n\nLion Air Group Managing Director Captain Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi told CNN on Wednesday that Lion Air strictly follow Boeing's guidance for operating the 737 MAX 8s, as laid out in the maintenance manual book.\n\n\"Pilots write in the logbook about the problem they had in the flight, then our technicians fix it and write (what) they did in the logbook,\" said the managing director, adding that technical conversations between pilot and technician regarding the aircraft are written and signed in a document called the Aircraft Flight and Maintenance Log.\n\nHowever, analysts have asked why the plane wasn't grounded earlier, when the problem with the air speed indicator issue first surfaced.\n\n\"The question is why wasn't this plane pulled from service and the problem system removed,\" said Geoffrey Thomas.\n\nLion Air Group's managing director told CNN that Boeing's maintenance manual does not provide instructions to ground the aircraft, even if they encounter a repeated problem.\n\n\"As long as we fixed the problem and the technician declares that aircraft is safe to fly, the pilot will fly the aircraft, because that means the aircraft is safe to fly,\" said Captain Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi.\n\nPlane was intact when it crashed, investigators say\n\nLion Air Flight 610 was intact with its engines running when it crashed at high speed into the Java Sea, Tjahjono said Monday.\n\nTjahjono said that due to the small size of the debris found and loss of the plane's engine blades, investigators determined that Flight 610 did not explode in the air, but was in \"good shape\" before it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff.\n\nSome of the families of the victims aboard Flight 610 were taken by boat to the crash site location on Tuesday to pray for their loved ones and view the recovery process in-person, Muhammad Syaugi, head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency said.\n\nHe said that his team was still working to locate the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which he believes is buried under the deep mud.\n\nAfter initially hearing a \"ping\" from the CVR on Saturday, diving teams could no longer hear a signal from the device.\n\nMeanwhile, the plane's other black box, the flight data recorder, was located Thursday, and investigators said it showed Flight 610 had performed 19 flights -- including its final flight."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Man United stun

had had the better of the exchanges before opening the scoring and could have added to their advantage before United equalized.\n\nCuadrado fired over after linking up with Ronaldo while a long-range Pjanic shot dipped just over.\n\nThe Italian side would come to rue that profligacy, though, when United were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Juve penalty area.\n\nMata stepped up and clipped the ball over the defensive wall and past the despairing Wojciech Szczesny.\n\nWithin three minutes, United were ahead. Another free-kick, this time from close to the touch line was swung in by Ashley Young and allowed to bounce before glancing off Szczesny, Bonucci and then Sandro as it dropped into the Juve net.\n\nSecond best for the majority of the match, United players could hardly believe their luck at securing such a dramatic win.\n\nLuke Shaw (L) Juan Cuadrado prepare to compete for the ball.\n\nJuventus would have qualified for the last-16 had they held on for the draw.\n\nAs things stand, a victory at home over Valencia in their next Champions League match will still ensure their progress.\n\nManchester United face Young Boys next and know that a victory coupled with a Juve win or draw against Valencia ensure they also escape the group stages."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "The shooter has been identified as a 28-year-old former Marine, according to the Ventura County Sheriff", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/CCTtCJ3mN18/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:34:40", "body_paragraphs": "In a news conference Thursday afternoon, law enforcement officials said the investigation was ongoing and that there were no indications the shooter was acting with others.\n\nThe FBI is continuing to process the crime scene, and there are no indications the shooter was working any associates, said FBI Assistant Director Paul Delacourt.

But after speaking with him, they decided not to detain him under laws that allow for the temporary detention of people with psychiatric issues.\n\nSeven months later, officers swarmed his home again for a very different reason: a mass shooting.\n\nLong was identified by police on Thursday as the gunman who killed 12 people and injured more than a dozen more in a sudden spree of violence at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks.\n\nSurvivors of the shooting said the gunman, dressed in black and wearing glasses, shot a security guard outside and then shot a young woman working at the counter just inside the door before opening fire on others.\n\nOne of the victims , Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus , was fatally shot when he entered the bar and tried to stop the rampaging gunman, Dean said.\n\nPolice then regrouped and, after waiting for reinforcements, were able to enter the bar. Inside, they found Long dead of what Dean said he believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nOne handgun, a legally purchased .45-caliber Glock, was found at the scene. The weapon usually holds 10 rounds, plus another in the chamber, but the gunman used an extended magazine in the shooting, Dean said.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor to the bar\n\nOn Thursday morning, Dean said he did not know of the shooter's motive, and he did not know of any connection between Long and the Borderline bar.\n\nBut friends told CNN that Long frequently visited the bar.\n\nPolice identified Ian David Long as the gunman in the mass shooting.\n\n\"We would go to Borderline together. He really liked it,\" said one woman who has been friends with Long for five years and does not want her name made public.\n\n\"I would make fun of him, because he would drag me there. Sometimes we'd go there to have a drink, sit and talk, listen to music,\" she said.\n\nBorderline, a Western-themed establishment known to regularly host country, salsa and swing dancing nights, was hosting a college country night on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"There was a community there. He was a part of that community. The whole bar is line dancing. People do choreographed dances for hours, cowboy boots and hats in the middle of the suburbs of Thousand Oaks,\" the friend said.\n\nA person who was a childhood friend of Long's until their early 20s and who does not want their name revealed publicly similarly said they used to go to Borderline together. The friend expressed shock that Long would do such a thing.\n\n\"I don't know what the hell happened. He was always happy. I never thought this would ever come from him. We used to go snowboarding all the time. He was a good guy,\" the friend said.\n\nA third friend who does not want to be publicly identified said Long stopped communicating two years ago but said the shooting was unlike him.\n\n\"He wasn't unhinged, he wasn't violent. He was a sweet guy who served his country and was using his GI Bill to go to college and get a degree to help more people,\" the friend said. \"Out of our group of friends I thought the highest of him. This is just horrible and I'm so sorry for the victims and his family.\"\n\nHe was in the Marine Corps\n\nThe gunman was on active duty with the US Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013, according to Defense Department records.\n\nHe posted information about his military service on a special forces forum called ShadowSpear in March 2017.\n\nUnder the name \"doorkicker03,\" Long said he had served in Afghanistan, was an infantry machine gunner in the Marine Corps for 4\u00bd years, and was an instructor in Okinawa in Japan.\n\nDepartment of Defense records show he was a corporal and went to Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011.\n\nThomas Burke, a pastor who served with Long in the same US Marine Corps regiment, said Long's battalion arrived during intense fighting in Helmand province.\n\nBut Burke warned against too quickly blaming Long's actions on trauma experienced during war.\n\n\"PTSD doesn't create homicidal ideation,\" Burke said. \"We train a generation to be as violent as possible, then we expect them to come home and be OK. It's not mental illness. It's that we're doing something to a generation, and we're not responding to the needs they have.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Marines in 2013, Long went to college in California.\n\n\"I am graduating with a B.S. in Athletic Training in two months,\" he wrote in his ShadowSpear post. \"I found out a little too late that just wasn't the job for me. Maybe the ego got the better of me but it took only one time for a 19-year-old D-2 athlete to talk down to me and tell me how to do my job that I realized this wasn't the career I wanted to head.\"\n\nLong did not complete his degree. He was a student at California State University, Northridge, majoring in athletic training from 2013 to 2016, but he did not graduate, university representative Carmen Ramos Chandler said.\n\nLong also went to the College of the Canyons for two spring semesters, according to that school.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Mass shooting at California bar Molly Esterline is hugged by David Crawford on the scene of a shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, on Thursday, November 8.

John Ratcliffe of Texas, former Judge John Michael Luttig, Judge Edith Jones, former Judge Janice Rogers Brown, outgoing GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nMatthew Whitaker\n\nNamed by Trump on Wednesday as the acting head of the Justice Department, Whitaker was previously Sessions' chief of staff. A CNN report in September, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's fate was openly uncertain, said Justice Department officials had prepared for Whitaker to take over for Rosenstein as the Justice Department's number two.\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that Whitaker spoke with Trump at the time about replacing Rosenstein and that Whitaker told people his understanding was that he could become the next deputy attorney general.\n\nWhitaker is a former CNN legal commentator and former US attorney who directed the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014. In a CNN op-ed written last year, Whitaker argued that special counsel Robert Mueller was \"dangerously close to crossing\" a red line following reports that Mueller was looking into Trump's finances as part of his investigation.\n\nNoel Francisco\n\nAt the same time Whitaker was considered as a replacement for Rosenstein, CNN reported that Justice Department officials had begun planning for Solicitor General Noel Francisco to step in as acting attorney general to oversee the special counsel probe.\n\nAs solicitor general, Francisco is already one of the top authorities within the Justice Department and has regularly defended the Trump administration before the Supreme Court. Francisco came to the administration from the law firm Jones Day, where he worked with recently departed White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe\n\nRatcliffe was among those floated as a replacement for Sessions ahead of the midterm elections. Ratcliffe is a former federal prosecutor, and he won re-election on Tuesday by an overwhelming margin.\n\nHis congressional biography touts his conservative bona fides and experience as a prosecutor, naming terror convictions in particular.\n\nHe is a member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Ethics committees.\n\nJohn Michael Luttig\n\nLuttig is a former federal appellate judge and Justice Department official who left the government to work as general counsel at Boeing.\n\nBefore he left for Boeing during the George W. Bush administration, Luttig had been a finalist for vacancies on the Supreme Court, and he denied at the time that he was stepping down because of \"the Supreme Court process.\" Luttig clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative judicial icon who died in 2016.\n\nA source close to Luttig said he had been considered for the role of FBI director after Trump fired James Comey.\n\nEdith Jones\n\nJudge Edith Jones sits on the 5th US Circuit of Court of Appeals, and CNN previously reported that she might be in play as a replacement for Sessions.\n\nJones, who like Luttig was once considered a potential Supreme Court nominee under Bush, courted controversy five years ago from civil rights groups after she was alleged to have said that she believes some ethnic groups are more prone to violence than others.\n\nJanice Rogers Brown\n\nJanice Rogers Brown has also emerged as a possible candidate.\n\nBrown, a former California Supreme Court associate justice and former US circuit judge, retired from the bench in August 2017 and moved back to California. A source close to her indicated that she would not be interested in the attorney general job and did not want to return to Washington.\n\nTrey Gowdy\n\nA Republican source told CNN that Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was being floated as a potential replacement for Sessions.\n\nThe outgoing conservative representative and former prosecutor became widely known during the Obama administration as he pursued an extended investigation into a 2012 deadly attack on a US mission in Benghazi, Libya. But he also repeatedly came to the defense of the Justice Department under Sessions' tenure as attorney general as Trump railed against Sessions and the special counsel investigation. At the same time, he has pressed the department for access to information and clashed with current and former top officials.\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nGraham has wavered as much or more than anyone in his public opinion of Trump. Graham lashed out against him repeatedly during Trump's presidential bid, but following Trump's win, Graham emerged as one of his top allies. Following an emotional rebuke of his Democratic colleagues during the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Graham's positive position among Trump's supporters has only ascended further.\n\nBut, as with Gowdy, he repeatedly defended Sessions from Trump and called for Mueller's independence. He has also publicly denied any interest in leaving the Senate for a position in Trump's Cabinet, and he responded to the news of Sessions' ouster by reaffirming his desire to remain in the Senate.\n\n\"As to me, I will be part of a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate -- working with the President and my Republican and Democratic colleagues -- to make America safer and more prosperous,\" Graham tweeted."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller's team defends his authority in court amid Justice Department shakeup", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/s7htMZSopQA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:34:43", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) This week's shakeup at the Department of Justice could affect the outcome of a subpoena challenge that an associate of Trump ally Roger Stone is waging against special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThat quickly became clear Thursday during oral arguments at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is hearing the challenge from Stone associate Andrew Miller.\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson instructed attorneys from both sides to argue their case as if the hearing were occurring 24 hours earlier, before \"the events of yesterday afternoon,\" a veiled reference to President Donald Trump's decision to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday.\n\nHenderson, appointed to this court by President George H.W. Bush, said the three-judge panel would likely ask the lawyers to file new briefs adjusting their arguments to reflect the news.\n\nThe Justice Department shakeup affects the Russia investigation because acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has assumed the role of overseeing Mueller. Whitaker has previously bashed Mueller in public comments, raising concerns that he might now move to shut down or neuter the probe.\n\nAt one point during Thursday's hearing, prosecutor Michael Dreeben was asked whether Mueller's overseer could change or rescind the May 2017 order that appointed the special counsel.\n\nDreeben acknowledged that Mueller's boss had the power to make those changes. The line of questioning seemed to lay out a road map that Whitaker could follow to fire Mueller, though nobody explicitly stated that in the courtroom or mentioned Whitaker by name.\n\nOutside the courthouse after the hearing, Miller's attorney Paul Kamenar more explicitly described how Mueller could be removed.\n\nWhitaker \"can either revoke the regulations altogether or amend the order ... and therefore make Mueller an at-will prosecutor ... meaning he can be fired without cause,\" Kamenar said. \"And we think that that is the way under the Constitution it should be done for accountability.\"\n\nIn a discussion during the hearing about Mueller's supervision, Judge Judith Rogers noted that \"what may be inappropriate to one deputy attorney general might not be inappropriate to another.\" The comments from the Clinton appointee were a nod to the reality that a new boss for Mueller could reach very different conclusions about whether he was running a fair investigation.\n\nBeyond the drama unfolding outside the courthouse this week, Thursday's hearing largely focused on the substantive issue of whether Mueller had been appointed in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nKamenar argued that Mueller has \"extraordinary prosecutorial power\" and \"lacks supervision\" despite \"acting like a US attorney at large.\" According to his arguments, Mueller is so powerful that instead of being appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he is more like a US attorney -- who needed to be tapped by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nKamenar also made a case that Rosenstein never had the power to appoint Mueller in the first place. He said Sessions' recusal from overseeing the probe in March 2017 meant Rosenstein \"could handle the investigation part but not the appointment part,\" which was still under Sessions' purview.\n\nJudge Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, had some sharp questions for Kamenar. They engaged in an extended back-and-forth about the case law, with Srinivasan appearing to disagree with some of Kamenar's interpretations.\n\nFor his part, Dreeben pointed to a series of court decisions and urged the appeals panel to \"take heed of precedents\" and fully uphold Mueller's powers. Before Thursday's hearing, four district-level federal judges had upheld Mueller's appointment and constitutional authority.\n\nDreeben also pushed back on the notion that Mueller lacked adequate supervision.\n\n\"He is aware of what we're doing,\" Dreeben said in an apparent reference to Rosenstein. \"It is not the case that the special counsel is off and wandering in a free-floating environment.\"\n\nThursday's hearing came after months of legal wrangling. Mueller's team subpoenaed Miller in May, demanding that he testify before their grand jury in DC. Miller eventually beefed up his legal team and, with funding from conservative legal groups, decided to fight the subpoena.\n\nHis case was heard by Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court, who eviscerated his legal arguments against Mueller's powers in a sweeping ruling in July. She ordered Miller to appear before the grand jury, though that hasn't happened yet, since the case was appealed.\n\nMiller is one of about a dozen Stone associates who have testified before the grand jury, given voluntary interviews to investigators or received subpoenas from Mueller's team. Investigators have ramped up their scrutiny of Stone in recent months and have focused on his supposed contacts with WikiLeaks, his political committees that were active in 2016 and more.\n\nStone and Miller have known each other for years, with Miller occasionally working as Stone's driver, traveling aide and \"tech guy\" who handled Stone's website. A self-identified Libertarian, Miller has also been a legal marijuana farmer in California and currently paints houses in Missouri -- and he says he knows nothing about Russian collusion or election interference.\n\nStone, who was not at Thursday's hearing and was not a party in the proceedings, vehemently denies colluding with Russia during the 2016 campaign and questions whether the Kremlin even interfered, despite the consensus from US intelligence agencies.\n\nThis was the first public appeals hearing regarding the Mueller probe. Kamenar said after the hearing that he would \"certainly\" appeal to the Supreme Court if the appeals judges rule against him, though experts say it's unclear whether the high court would take the case.\n\n\"We believe at that point with this current bench that they would find that Mueller is basically acting as a rogue type of a prosecutor,\" Kamenar said. Asked if he was referring to the presence of newly minted Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Kamenar replied, \"Absolutely.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller's team has begun writing its final report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/GFXBRvM3T78/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:34:43", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) As he was preparing to remove Jeff Sessions as attorney general, President Donald Trump had already begun reviewing with his lawyers the written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe move to replace Sessions with Matt Whitaker, who has been openly critical of the special counsel, comes as the White House braces for a return of public activity on the Russia investigation following a pre-election quiet period, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker also now takes over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's role in overseeing the special counsel probe, which officials inside the Justice Department and lawyers representing witnesses believe is moving closer to a conclusion.\n\nMueller's team has begun writing its final report, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nBefore that happens, one of the major questions in the Russia investigation remains to be answered: What happens to Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser who has been at the center of a whirlwind of legal activity behind the scenes even during the election-related public quiet period by Mueller.\n\nAs recently as a month ago, Mueller asked Trump's lawyers to produce call and visitor logs related to Stone from Trump Tower in New York, according to a source briefed on the matter. The request at this late stage of the investigation came as something of a surprise to lawyers involved, given that the Mueller team has been focused for months on Stone and his activities before the 2016 election.\n\nAmong the questions Mueller has asked the President to provide written responses on are queries about Stone and his communications with then-candidate Trump, according to a source briefed on the matter.\n\nDespite the change in leadership at the Justice Department, the Trump legal team believes it won't affect its approach to the Mueller questions, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe President and his lawyers have been aiming to return answers to Mueller's questions later this month, according to one source familiar with the matter. No final decision on an in-person interview has been made.\n\nBut Trump's legal team and other lawyers representing witnesses in the investigation expect that the President's responses to Mueller could be one of the final pieces of the 18-month-long probe before the investigators present a report on their findings.\n\nTrump made clear once again in a news conference Wednesday he believes the investigation is a waste of time and money.\n\n\"It's a disgrace, it should have never been started because there was no crime,\" Trump said.\n\nEven after Mueller completes his work, Tuesday's midterm election results mean that House Democrats will also be in a position to expand investigations of Trump. That means Mueller will not be the end of Russia-related questions of Trump and his campaign.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former FBI Agent: Mueller may no longer be protected Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former FBI Agent: Mueller may no longer be protected 03:23\n\nWhat does Stone have?\n\nThe Stone portion of the investigation relates to one of Mueller's central responsibilities: to tell Americans whether there's evidence of collusion between Russians and people associated with the Trump campaign related to the 2016 election.\n\nInvestigators have been circling back to Stone's associates they have already interviewed with additional questions. And at least one -- author and well-known conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi -- is still in discussions about potentially appearing for a second time before the Washington, DC, grand jury that Mueller has been using for the investigation.\n\nOver the last two months, Corsi has been talking to Mueller's investigators \"in a really constant basis,\" he said in a video he posted online on Monday.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller's team is set to appear in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to defend the special counsel's authority as another one of Stone's former associates aims to quash a subpoena for grand jury testimony.\n\nStone has denied any wrongdoing and has said he didn't have any inside knowledge about plans by WikiLeaks to publish hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign stolen by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the election.\n\nStone insists he never shared anything about WikiLeaks with then-candidate Trump.\n\n\"I never discussed any of this with Donald Trump,\" Stone told CNN recently. \"It's one of the questions that Mr. Mueller wants the President to answer -- one of the written questions. I'm highly confident that his answer will be that he knew nothing about it. We just never discussed it.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Stone told CNN, \"I never visited Trump Tower after August of 2015 until the President-elect asked me to visit him after the election.\" Stone said he visited just one time around late November of 2016 or early December, and that this was his last visit to Trump Tower.\n\nThe conversation during that one visit was \"mostly congratulatory. It was innocuous. Nothing heavy.\"\n\nIn terms of phone calls in 2016 with Trump, he says they were \"occasional and in all cases initiated by him. And we never discussed WikiLeaks.\"\n\nAll signs point to an investigation that is winding down, though Mueller hasn't provided any timeline for completing his work.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roger Stone on his alleged role with Wikileaks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Roger Stone on his alleged role with Wikileaks 08:33\n\nElection's impact on Mueller\n\nEven with the Mueller probe seemingly nearing its end, the Russia meddling investigation and its impact is expected to reverberate for months.\n\nThe White House is seeking to hire as many as two dozen lawyers for the counsel's office, which will soon by led by Pat Cipollone, following the departure of Don McGahn, sources briefed on the search say. The legal firepower, the President's lawyers believe, will be needed as newly empowered Democrats launch a new round of probes, including pursuing parts of the Trump-Russia matter that Republican leaders had blocked.\n\nOne of the important questions the new White House legal team is expected to have to address is whether any of Mueller's findings can be shared with either Congress or the public given executive privilege concerns, which could block release of some or all of Mueller's work.\n\nUnder Justice Department regulations, Mueller is required to produce a \"confidential report\" at the end of his investigation, which includes \"the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.\"\n\nBut the regulations do not require that Mueller's report be released to the public, and with Whitaker taking over, it is not clear whether he will choose to release it at all, or in what form.\n\nOne of the sources familiar with the matter said the report will be detailed in part because Mueller's team wants to make sure it withstands public scrutiny. It is expected to include an analysis of the allegations, any information or statements made over the course of voluntary interviews, a legal explanation of why the evidence didn't meet the prosecution bar and an overall defense of the investigation.\n\nHow much the Mueller team has accomplished remains a subject of partisan debate. Critics of the President cite guilty pleas from top Trump campaign associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and his deputy Rick Gates, as well as Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser.\n\nSo far the Mueller team has brought charges against 35 people and entities, secured six guilty pleas, and prison sentences against three people.\n\nSupporters of the President argue that none of the guilty pleas, and the one court conviction, have had anything to do with the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is what Mueller is supposed to be investigating. The new acting-attorney general has questioned in the past whether there is any obstruction to investigate.\n\nSecond-guessing of Mueller\n\nEven inside the Justice Department, there's been second-guessing of some of the Mueller team's work.\n\nOne particular focus has the Mueller team's decision earlier this year to include a Russian company among entities and people charged related to operating an internet troll farm that played a central role in Russian interference efforts in 2016.\n\nSome Justice Department lawyers raised concerns about charging the company, for fear it could force the government to share information in discovery that could end up with the Russians.\n\nThose concerns have proven prescient in recent months as the company, Concord Management, hired US lawyers to fight the special counsel in court on a series of fronts. The Concord lawyers have won court permission to access to sensitive information used to bring the charges, though the judge has restricted what can be shared with foreign nationals.\n\n\"What a lot of people thought were vulnerabilities in the indictment are now coming to light,\" said one former Justice Department official.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes doubts were discussed among Justice Department lawyers, some of whom were consulted by the Mueller team before the charges were brought.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.\n\nSome DOJ lawyers have groused that the Mueller team should have taken a less risky course by focusing the indictment against the Russian nationals, without the companies and entities. That's because since the individuals wouldn't likely respond to the charges and subject themselves to US legal process.\n\nGiven the legal fight that has ensued, DOJ will have to handle the upcoming trial in the case and any other legal matters that arise from it, perhaps long after Mueller has wrapped up his inquiry."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Remember the midterms?

It's a higher rate for the 50 largest metropolitan areas combined, with 4.9 people per 100,000 killed by a gun. This is an increase from 2012-13, when the national rate was 3.7 per 100,000 nationwide and 4.1 per 100,000 for major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe rates vary widely by city. For example, there's a higher chance of being killed by a gun in New Orleans than in the Providence, Rhode Island, area. About 1 in 100,000 residents was killed by a gun in Providence and Warwick combined, compared with 16.6 per 100,000 residents in New Orleans.\n\nNationally, homicide was the 16th-leading cause of death, the new report notes. Guns were used in 74% of those deaths. For children between the ages of 10 and 19, guns were used in even more homicides: 87%.\n\nMen and boys were most often the victims of homicides, accounting for 85% of the firearm deaths.\n\nFor suicides, there is also a great variety between cities. Oklahoma City, for instance, saw 13.5 suicides by gun per 100,000 residents, compared with New York, Newark and Jersey City, which combined for a rate of 1.5 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of people older than 10 who are using a gun to kill themselves has increased, too. Researchers don't use statistics from gun deaths for children under 10, because those self-inflicted deaths are probably accidentals, according to the report.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for everyone over 10, with guns used in half of all those deaths. It's the second-leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 19, with guns used in 42% of those cases.\n\nThough the gun suicide rate for young people is notably lower than for other age groups, the report finds that those numbers are increasing.\n\n\"I rarely take care of a suicide attempt with a gun in the emergency room. The kinetic energy of a bullet is far more effective than taking pills that have a longer duration and more opportunity for intervention,\" said Dr. Stephen Hargarten , director of the Comprehensive Injury Center, associate dean of the Office of Global Health and a professor of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nHargarten, who was not involved in the new report, said many groups are working to reduce firearm-related suicides, but it remains \"such a challenging area.\"\n\nThe latest increase in gun-related deaths is similar to the rates seen in the 2006-07 time period, the report said. The US has the world's highest rate of gun ownership by civilians, according to research, and the highest rate of gun-related deaths among industrialized countries.\n\nThe authors of the new report note that it is \"too soon to know\" whether this recent increase in gun deaths represents a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.\n\nHargarten said he hopes the US government will see an increase in gun deaths in the proper frame, \"as a complex biological and sociological disease,\" and increase funding for research. Gun violence is the least-studied of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, a 2017 study found\n\nHargarten said he has seen cities, states and even major medical groups starting to spend more money on this kind of research, but he -- like many others who do research on gun violence -- feels that the federal government needs to \"step it up\" to figure out what is causing this problem.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Where is the federal government in all of this? When there are so many deaths, we need to invest in this issue now,\" Hargarten said. \"Look what we did with HIV and AIDS when it was breaking out in the '80s and '90s. The federal government addressed it, and the complexity and the political issues, and it helped groups most at risk, by investing our resources appropriately, and it made a huge difference in that disease process. It's imperative that we do that for guns.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Fertility rates cut in half since 1950 -- but the population is still growing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/N8my2lw28nM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:34:47", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The world's total fertility rate has been cut in half since 1950, but the population is still rising, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet.\n\nThe total fertility rate -- or the average number of children a woman would have if she lived through all her reproductive years -- declined from 4.7 live births in 1950 to 2.4 in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the global population has nearly tripled since 1950, from 2.6 billion people to 7.6 billion, the report says. An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Trump administration weakens Obamacare birth control coverage mandate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/clAlWW-oCtQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:34:48", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Trump administration issued two final rules on Wednesday providing employers more flexibility with exemptions to deny women insurance coverage for birth control.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employer-provided health insurance plans are required to cover birth control as a preventive service.\n\nNow, the US Department of Health and Human Services has issued a final rule providing exemption from the contraceptive coverage mandate to entities that object to such coverage based on religious beliefs.

There were more than 150 statewide measures on ballots this midterm election , and several involved health-related issues such as taxes on feminine hygiene products, Medicaid expansion, abortion access and legalizing the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana. Based on the preliminary vote results, here's what some voters went for and what they rejected.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2 adds language to the state Constitution to give a fetus the same rights as a human who has been born.\n\nAbortion rights supporters worry that the amendment could be used to criminalize some forms of in-vitro fertilization and contraception. There are also concerns that should the US Supreme Court end Roe v. Wade, this amendment would be a \"trigger ban,\" meaning abortion would be outlawed in some states.\n\nThis \"personhood\" ballot measure doesn't have exemptions like in other states' laws that carve out the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1 narrowly passed . Also known as the No Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment, it explicitly states that its Constitution has nothing in it that \"secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" Unlike Alabama's law, it has an exception for rape, incest, fetal anomaly or threats to the woman's life. It also restricts Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nMarijuana\n\nAdult recreational users of weed will be able to use it legally in another state.\n\nAccording to preliminary results, more than 54% of voters i n Michigan said yes to the initiative that imposes a 10-ounce limit for Michigan residents, creates a state licensing system, will allow for retail sales subject to a 10% tax and changes several weed-related violations to civil infractions.\n\nThat makes 10 states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington -- plus the District of Columbia that allow for recreational use.\n\nOther states' weed-related initiatives focused on medical marijuana; prior to the election, 31 states and the District of Columbia had laws that legalize or decriminalize it.\n\nMissouri had three medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot this year. Voters gave a definite yes to Amendment 2 , which legalizes medical marijuana, taxes it at 4% and guarantees that the money will be spent on health care services for veterans. Amendment 3 and Proposition C , which would also have legalized medical use but would have spent the tax revenue differently, failed.\n\nHealth care\n\nmostly Republican-dominated states, voted yes to expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level. In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase.

In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase.\n\ndoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion. Montana voters appear to be rejecting Medicaid expansion, but they are still counting votes on this initiative. Montana's I-185 would have also raised taxes on tobacco products to help fund the expansion and other health care programs. The tobacco industry has spent millions in the state to fight the initiative since it would havedoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion.\n\nOther health care initiatives were on the ballot in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada.\n\nauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Voters gave a resounding yes to California's Proposition 4 , which willauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Proposition 11 , which requires people who work on ambulances to stay on call during breaks and require employers to give EMTs and paramedics additional training and some paid mental health services.\n\nCalifornia voters rejected Proposition 8 , which would have required dialysis clinics to refund patients for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care.\n\nthe number of patients assigned to It appears that voters rejected Question 1 in Massachusetts that would have limitedthe number of patients assigned to registered nurses working in a hospital. The state has restrictions for intensive care units but not for any other part of the hospital.\n\nVoters seem to have said yes to Nevada's Question 4 , which requires the state legislature to remove taxes on durable medical equipment, oxygen equipment and mobility devices that are prescribed by a licensed provider. And early results are in favor of Nevada's Question 2 that removes sales tax from feminine hygiene products.\n\nOther health matters\n\nIn Massachusetts, preliminary voting results with Question 3 seem to suggest voters said yes to keeping a law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public places like restaurants, stores, hotels and hospitals. There's no federal law that provides such protections for people who identify as transgender.\n\nSome of the other ballot initiatives involved tax collection.\n\nMaine's Question 1 would have created a payroll tax and non-wage income tax that would fund a home health care program, but preliminary results show that it failed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nrejected eliminated the option for a felony charge for the possession or use of drugs, would require the state to spend on programs that would include helping people get into drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, would create sentencing programs that involve drug rehab, and would prohibit courts from sending a person to prison for non-criminal probation violations.

It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries, handling 2.9 million lorries last year. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben.\n\nBut that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage.\n\nDover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value, handling 17% of the UK trade in goods.\n\nAmong critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum - suggested Mr Raab should have \"done your homework before backing Leave\".\n\nThe Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was \"relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy\".\n\nShe added: \"While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Diabetes type 2: 'I blame myself for the loss of my leg'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46144379", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:35:02", "body_paragraphs": "Video\n\nEvery week 170 people in the UK lose a limb because of diabetes.\n\nAround four million people in the UK are living with diabetes - and around 90% of them have type 2 diabetes, which is often linked to being overweight or inactive.\n\nDiabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than \u00a31 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital.\n\nAnd a further 12 million people could be at risk of getting type 2 diabetes in the future.\n\nStephen Richardson has told the BBC he blames himself for the loss of his limb."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Paypal stops handling payments for Tommy Robinson", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46139193", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:35:07", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tommy Robinson at the Old Bailey in London to hear contempt charges\n\nPaypal has told former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson it will no longer process payments on his behalf.\n\nMr Robinson said the online payments system told him he did not fit within its user guidelines and would never be able to use the platform again.\n\nHe said he had been using the platform to collect donations to fight his legal battles and branded the ban \"fascism\".\n\nOnline petitions calling on finance firms to sever links with him have gained thousands of signatures.\n\nIn a statement, Paypal said it could not comment on individual customers but added that it regularly reviewed accounts to ensure their use aligned with its acceptable use policy.\n\nAccounts that broke its policies would be closed, it said.\n\nPaypal added: \"We do not take decisions like these lightly, and we work hard to be rigorous and fair-minded when reviewing PayPal accounts.\n\n\"Striking the necessary balance between upholding free expression and open dialogue and protecting principles of tolerance, diversity and respect for all people is a challenge that many companies are grappling with today.\"\n\nTwitter ban\n\nBut Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, said: \"They just don't like my opinion and want to silence me.\n\n\"The government and establishment can see I have public support, they can see I have the ability to fight back.\"\n\nHe said Paypal had also frozen \"a lot\" of money that was in the account for 180 days.\n\nIn September, Paypal stopped processing payments for conspiracy theory site Infowars for promoting \"hate and intolerance\".\n\nIn May, Mr Robinson, 35, was jailed for contempt of court.

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but head north-east to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and women are having one child, on average, in a lifetime.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nIf the fertility rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (the figure is higher in countries with a high risk of dying in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, zero nations were in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"But at a global level there is no migration solution.\"\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link":

The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year.\n\n92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes.

Over the same year, around \u00a3350 million was spent on insulin, and \u00a3181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: \"Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place.\n\n\"The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes.\"\n\nFollow Laurel Ives on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "World War One: Theresa May paying respects in France and Belgium", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46145199", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:35:28", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTheresa May will lay a wreath at the graves of the first and last UK soldiers killed in World War One as she travels to France and Belgium to mark the Armistice centenary.\n\nThe prime minister will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel for the commemorations on Friday.\n\nThe visits reflect a shared history and shared future, Mrs May will say.\n\nA private meeting and working lunch with Mr Macron will also take place.\n\nThe prime minister's visit will begin in Belgium's St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons, where she will visit the graves of John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison.\n\nHe was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday.\n\nMrs May and Mr Michel will attend a reception at which they will meet British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces before she travels to France.\n\nShe will meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One.

publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king.\n\n\"You operate,\" he says in the BBC documentary, \"within the constitutional parameters.\"\n\nIt is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power.\n\nWhat has he campaigned on?\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London.\n\nHe said it looked like a \"vast municipal fire station\" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend\".\n\nIndeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years.\n\nAnd this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation.\n\nIn 1992, he said: \"I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness.\"\n\nClimate change\n\nThe heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability.\n\nIn 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment.\n\nHe added: \"Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic.\"\n\nBBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: \"The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change.\n\n\"It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat.\"\n\nWildlife conservation\n\nPrince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, he said: \"With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left.\"\n\nHomeopathy\n\nPrince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy -

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but head north-east to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and women are having one child, on average, in a lifetime.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nIf the fertility rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (the figure is higher in countries with a high risk of dying in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, zero nations were in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"But at a global level there is no migration solution.\"\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link":

We thought let's merge them and see what happens.\"\n\nUsing a special bio-ink, the team printed the bacteria on the cap of the mushroom in a spiral pattern. They had previously used an electronic ink to embed graphene nano-ribbons on to the surface of the fungus to collect the current.\n\nWhen they shone a light on this magical mushroom, it caused the cyanobacteria to generate a small amount of electricity.\n\nNot quite a lightbulb moment but proof that the idea works.

The black box shows the area which was used for dating the cave art\n\nThe earliest known painting of an animal has been identified in a cave on the island of Borneo.\n\nThe artwork, which is at least 40,000 years old, is thought to be the oldest example of figurative painting - where real objects are depicted rather than abstract shapes.\n\nThe researchers aren't certain what animal it represents, but their hunch is that it's a banteng, a type of wild cow that lives in the area today.\n\nThe work appears in Nature journal.\n\nThe painting was found in a system of caves in the remote and rugged mountains of East Kalimantan, an Indonesian province on Borneo.\n\nThe caves contain thousands of other prehistoric paintings, drawings and other imagery, including hand stencils, animals, abstract signs and symbols.\n\nImage copyright Luc-Henri Fage Image caption The 40,000-year-old animal painting can be seen on the far right of this image of the cave wall\n\n\"This is a very large area with many paintings and many caves - it's a major archaeological discovery,\" said Prof Francesco d'Errico, an authority on prehistoric art from the University of Bordeaux, France, who was not involved in the latest research.\n\nCo-author Maxime Aubert, from Griffith University in Australia, commented: \"The oldest cave art image we dated is a large painting of an unidentified animal, probably a species of wild cattle still found in the jungles of Borneo - this has a minimum age of around 40,000 years and is now the earliest known figurative artwork.\"\n\nThe animal appears to have a spear shaft stuck in its flank and is one of a series of similar red-orange coloured paintings, which were made with iron-oxide pigment.\n\nThese paintings, which include other depictions of animals along with hand stencils, appear to represent the oldest phase of art in the cave.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Scientists spent several days trekking through rural Borneo to find the 40,000-year-old artwork.\n\nThe animals, said Dr Aubert, are \"painted in the same style with a large body and small legs\".\n\nTo come up with the 40,000-year date for the painting of the animal, Dr Aubert and colleagues used scientific dating techniques on calcium carbonate deposits close to the image.\n\nThe researchers also managed to date two red-orange hand stencils, which yielded minimum ages of 37,000 years. A third hand stencil - an example of abstract, rather than figurative art - had a maximum age of 51,800 years, even older than the animal painting.\n\nThe authors conclude that rock art locally developed in Borneo between around 52,000 and 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe second phase of painting in the cave is characterised by the use of purple-coloured paint, and dates to between 16,000 and 21,000 years ago. This phase includes some apparent depictions of humans.\n\nMaxime Aubert said: \"It looks like there was a transition from depicting the animal world to [depicting] the human world. And it's interesting because I think we have the same thing in Europe.\"\n\nImage copyright Pindi Setiawan Image caption The caves are located in a remote and mountainous region of East Kalimantan\n\nThe prehistoric cave paintings of Lascaux and Chauvet in France, and Altamira in Spain, are similarly magnificent. They contain images of a veritable prehistoric menagerie, including cave lions, hyenas, horses, deer, rhinos and bison.\n\nBut a paper published earlier this year in the journal Science pushed the dates for cave art in Europe back to as much as 65,000 years. These paintings pre-date the known arrival of modern humans in Europe, leading to the study's suggestion that they might have been made by Neanderthals.\n\nOne of the authors of that paper in Science was Prof Alistair Pike, an archaeologist from the University of Southampton. Prof Pike - who was not involved with the new research - welcomed the findings, but expressed reservations about the date for the oldest figurative painting.\n\n\"I have no doubt that they have dated painting to at least 40,000 years at their oldest site, and this is an exciting result as it shows that cave painting wasn't an isolated event... but that it had a wide geographical distribution,\" Prof Pike explained.\n\nImage copyright Pindi Setiawan Image caption The caves also contain paintings of humans; these ones date to 13,600 years ago\n\n\"But there are some doubts if their dated sample overlies the figurative art... it appears to lie over some pigment 15cm away from the animal figure, and while it once might have formed part of this figure (which is very weathered), they have not demonstrated it is part of it.\"\n\nProf d'Errico also sounded a note of caution, explaining that the discovery didn't tell us much about the geographical origins of art.\n\n\"I think things develop independently. There may be other areas where people were producing something similar but we haven't found it yet, or that it wasn't preserved,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I think that symbolic thinking and abstract representation have a long history. They develop gradually over 100,000 years if not more.\"\n\n\"It's probably something that is created, abandoned and then re-created in new form.\"\n\nThe area of Borneo where the caves are located is relatively unexplored, so there could be many other examples waiting to be found.\n\nThe same team recently reported dates as old as 39,000 years old for cave art from the nearby island of Sulawesi.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "ExoMars: Where to send Europe's robot rover?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46127058", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:36:32", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption ExoMars: A copy of the rover undergoing testing\n\nScientists and engineers are to meet in Leicester to choose a landing site on Mars for Europe's 2020 rover.\n\nThe six-wheeled robot will be targeted at one of two near-equatorial terrains on the Red Planet.\n\nThe ExoMars Site Selection Working Group must weigh which of the pair represents the biggest scientific interest but also offers a fair chance of getting down safely.\n\nLanding on the planet is notoriously hard. Most efforts have failed.\n\nAssuming ExoMars can overcome this hurdle, it will use a package of instruments to look for signs of past or present life, employing a drill to extend the search below the harsh conditions that persist at the planet's surface.\n\nThe meeting at Leicester's university has been convened by the European Space Agency (Esa) and comprises senior academics and officials from industry. Russia, a joint partner on the mission, is also well represented.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nWhat is the choice?\n\nThe working group will spend Thursday and Friday discussing the merits and shortcomings of Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis.\n\nScientifically speaking, these locations are quite similar. They are ancient landscapes that contain abundant clays - the type of sediments which result from the alteration of rock through prolonged contact with water.\n\nIt is in just this kind of setting where you might find evidence for ancient microbial life.\n\nCuriosity, the American rover currently operating on Mars in a deep bowl known as Gale Crater, has detected clay minerals in mudstones that very probably formed in lakes and the streams that fed them.\n\nThe sediments of interest at Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis likely had similar sorts of origins.\n\nImage copyright ESA/DLR/FU Berlin/NASA/MGS/MOLA Image caption Oxia Planum was the preferred choice had the rover launched in 2018\n\nImage copyright ESA/DLR/FU Berlin/NASA/MGS/MOLA Image caption Mawrth Vallis: The ellipses describe zones that can be targeted with confidence\n\nIs science the only consideration?\n\nFar from it. Great scientific prospects count for nothing if you cannot land the robot in one piece.\n\nEurope's previous touch-down effort, the Schiaparelli mission, crashed into Mars' surface in 2016 when the probe's onboard computer became confused about its altitude during the descent and switched off the braking thrusters far too early.\n\nSchiaparelli smacked into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nExoMars will be using a similar entry, descent and landing strategy that incorporates a capsule, a parachute system and retro-rockets.\n\nA factor that will bear heavily on the Leicester discussions is the knowledge that Oxia is at a much lower elevation than Mawrth - by about 1,000m. This would give the descending robot's parachute much longer to bite Mars' thin atmosphere and slow the supersonic approach towards the surface.\n\nWhat else has to be thought about?\n\nIn addition, Mawrth's position is slightly to the north of Oxia.\n\nThe angle of approach required to get to this higher latitude necessarily produces greater uncertainty in the eventual touch-down point.\n\nEngineers talk of confidence zones that are elliptical in shape. For both locations these ellipses are 19km wide, but, in the case of Mawrth, the length is 190km. For Oxia, it's 104km.\n\nHigh-resolution satellite images have been acquired of both sites.\n\nThese will have been examined for hazards such as steep slopes and deep gullies, and also for the preponderance of large boulders. ExoMars will come down on its Russian-built lander. If the legs find very uneven ground, the rover might not be able to drive off the platform, or, worse still, be tipped over.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The Schiaparelli robot hit the ground at high speed\n\nHow is the rover's development progressing?\n\nThis is a mission that has experienced delay after delay.\n\nOriginally set for 2011, the launch from Earth slipped to 2013, to 2016, to 2018, and is now scheduled for mid-2020.\n\nThis means all the various components of the mission - the rover, its landing mechanism and the cruise vehicle that shepherds everything from Earth to Mars - really need to be at Russia's Baikonur launch site in about a year's time to begin final integration and testing.\n\nOfficials say the schedule, despite some hiccups, is on track.\n\nClear signs that we are getting close include the inauguration of the rover's mission control in Turin later this month.\n\nOne very good piece of news to report is the restoration of autonomous navigation to the robot. This software will enable ExoMars to find its own way across the ground without the constant intervention of engineers back on Earth, and should speed up dramatically its ability to survey scientifically interesting places to drill.\n\nWhen do we get a decision?\n\nAmerica is also sending a rover to Mars in 2020. This is, broadly speaking, a copy of the Curiosity rover, although it will have different instrumentation and seek to find rock samples it cache for later return to Earth laboratories.\n\nAs with ExoMars, this mission is going through a site selection process. This should produce a recommendation sometime before the end of the year.\n\nThe Leicester working group's deliberations are closed to the media, but an announcement on its preference is promised for Friday afternoon.\n\nProtocol requires this be signed off by the heads of Esa and the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) before it becomes ExoMars' official destination, but it is highly unlikely that the Leicester choice would be blocked.\n\nImage caption Autonomous navigation software builds 3D models of the terrain ahead of the rover\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Mueller Annoyed By Dipshit Protestors Holding Up Traffic During Commute", "article_link": "https://politics.theonion.com/mueller-annoyed-by-dipshit-protestors-holding-up-traffi-1830323717", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:36:37", "body_paragraphs": "\u2018Get A Move On, Assholes, Some Of Us Want To Get Home After A Long Day At Work,\u2019 Special Counsel Screams At Demonstrators\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Laying on his horn while stuck in bumper-to-bumper gridlock, an annoyed special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly screamed at \u201cdipshit protestors\u201d from his car Thursday as a MoveOn rally held up traffic during his nightly commute. \u201cGet a move on, assholes!

Edgar, then 22, wanted to find work in the US to support his five younger sisters and their mother.\n\nBefore leaving, Edgar worked as a street vendor in Chichicastenango and all over Quiche. But sometime after his father abandoned the family, he became the sole breadwinner and his earnings were not enough to feed the family.\n\nEdgar paid a smuggler to take him over the border but they never found out whether or not he made it into the US, Xon said, speaking softly while fidgeting with the large laminated photograph of her brother she wore around her neck.\n\nThe photo was one of many worn by family members in Puebla this week as part of an annual caravan of Central American Mothers of Disappeared Migrants.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nTens of thousands of migrants and refugees have disappeared while travelling north through Mexico to the border with the US, according to human rights and migrant support groups.\n\nMany Central American migrants simply lose contact with their families along their northbound journey, but others are believed to have died either at the hands of organised crime groups or security forces or from dehydration or exposure to the elements, among other conditions.\n\nIn most cases, families of the disappeared never find out what happened.\n\nEvery year since 2004, Central American mothers and other relatives spend two weeks travelling thousands of kilometres in Mexico to search for their loved ones, raising awareness, and speaking out for radical changes in border and immigration policies.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThis year was Xon's second time participating in the mothers' caravan.\n\nShe stepped off the group's bus in Puebla to cheers, drumming and applause from members of dozens of local activist collectives, migrant support groups, feminist and student associations, and others who arrived at a city market to hear from the women from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua searching for their loved ones.\n\nThe caravan is organised by the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, a grassroots network coordinated in Mexico but with ties throughout Central America.\n\nMuch of the network's work is focused on attempting to locate migrants and refugees who have disappeared in Mexico and reunite them with their families. Sometimes they succeed. But often, they do not.\n\nThe movement also coordinates Puentes de Esperanza (Bridges of Hope), a project in which Mesoamerican Migrant Movement members travel the migrant trail in Mexico, find Central American migrants who have lost contact with their families, and then attempt to track down the relatives in Central America.\n\nThis year\u2019s caravan participants met mothers of disappeared migrants from Mauritania, Senegal, Morocco and other countries, forming global network.\n\nRuben Figueroa, the movement\u2019s coordinator for Central America and southeastern Mexico, called the meeting significant, adding that the group issued a declaration, which stated that the \u201cprocess of forced displacement all over the world has obligated people to leave their place of origin, their country, and their loved ones behind\u201d.\n\n'Just want to cry'\n\nThe mothers of disappeared migrants from the Americas, Africa and Europe urged governments worldwide to respect international law with regard to asylum, refugees and the treatment of migrants.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"Nothing can stop a mother who is searching for her son or daughter. Mothers will bring down all the barriers and cover all the kilometres they need to until they arrive at the truth,\" the mothers noted in the declaration.\n\nSiblings often do the same. Like Xon, Marcela Melchor has been searching for her sister for a decade. Her sister Izabel Melchor Ramos called home to wish their mother a Happy Mother's Day in May 2008. It was her last call.\n\n\"She always communicated by phone, but from public phones in Mexico,\" Melchor told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Indigenous Maya Kiche sisters are from Ixcan, in the northern reaches of the Quiche department of Guatemala.\n\nA single mother, Izabel first left home to work in a garment factory near Guatemala City to support her three children, but it became unsafe.\n\n\"There is a lot of crime. When she would leave work, she was followed and hassled,\" said Melchor, wearing her sister's photograph at the mothers caravan event Tuesday in Puebla.\n\nIzabel came home and then set out in January 2008 for Mexico to search for a job. She worked at a restaurant in Cancun for a while, but her last call home in May of that year was from the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico.\n\nAt the time, Izabel's three daughters were eight, 10 and 12 years old. She left them in her sister's care.\n\n\"They call me mama tia [mom-aunt]. I raised them,\" said Melchor.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThe entire family continues to search for Izabel. They found help from local associations in Ixcan, then from a Guatemala City organisation, and then from the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement.\n\nMelchor feels good to be with other women in similar positions on the mothers caravan, but focusing on so many stories and cases of disappeared migrants while covering more than 5,000km from home to and around Mexico and back is hard, she said.\n\n\"Sometimes there are moments of smiles, but sometimes you just want to cry,\" said Melchor.\n\n'Looking to survive'\n\nThis year the mothers caravan overlapped with the ongoing exodus of thousands Central American migrants and refugees, in large groups also called caravans, heading north through Mexico to the US. Aware of the stories of violence and disappearances, the migrants and refugees are sticking together for safety in numbers.\n\nAn initial wave of more than 1,000 Hondurans left their country last month, mainly fleeing violence, repression, poverty and unemployment. The group quickly grew to more than 5,000 people,\n\nThousands of Central Americans, mainly Hondurans and Salvadorans, have left in subsequent caravans and are heading north behind the first group, which is currently in Mexico City. An estimated 12,000 Central Americans are making the trek north en masse in large, visible groups.\n\nThe caravan of Central American relatives of disappeared migrants first met up with the first group of thousands of migrants and refugees in the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico at the outset of the mothers caravan.\n\nIf anyone has heard of my brother, if anyone knows him. Please tell us. Sofia Sebastiana Xon, sister of missing migrant, Edgar Rodolfo Xon Ajanel\n\nBoth Melchor and Xon told Al Jazeera they felt sadness when they witnessed the size and conditions of the group and heard some of the individual stories of participants. For Xon, it reminded her of her brother Edgar and why he left a decade ago.\n\n\"They're looking for a way to survive,\" said Xon, noting the insecurity and violence in many Central American countries.\n\nAsked if she wanted to add anything before the mothers caravan took off from Puebla to its next stop in Oaxaca on the way home to Central America, Xon began reeling off the basic details that could help identify her brother.\n\nIt was clear she has had practice reciting the litany of information.\n\nEdgar is 1.62 metres tall. He was 22 when he went missing, so would now be 32. His last known location was Matamoros. He has birthmarks on his nose and cheek, both on the left side, Xon continued.\n\n\"If anyone has heard of my brother, if anyone knows him,\" she pleaded. \"Please tell us.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Yemen peace talks 'pushed back to end of year'", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/yemen-peace-talks-pushed-year-181108204110140.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:36:41", "body_paragraphs": "The United Nation's envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, is no longer aiming to convene the country's warring parties for peace talks this month and will instead try to bring them together by the end of the year, according to a UN spokesperson.\n\nAddressing reporters on Thursday, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said Griffiths' goal was to hold consultations before the end of the year.\n\n\"There is always different challenges to bringing the parties together,\" Haq said.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is clear up any issues so that we can get a successful round of talks as soon as possible.\"\n\nGriffiths, who is due to brief the Security Council on November 16, is trying to salvage the peace talks that collapsed in September.\n\nHe said in a statement last week that he hoped to bring the parties to the negotiating table within a month.\n\nYears of war\n\nThe conflict in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country and home to an estimated 28 million people, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by Houthi rebels, who toppled the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\n\nConcerned by the rise of Houthis, believed to be backed by Iran, a US-backed Saudi-UAE military coalition intervened in 2015 with a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling Hadi's government.\n\nAccording to the UN, at least 10,000 people have been killed since the coalition entered the conflict.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

It recruits and funds local efforts to incorporate Marsy's Law, a controversial set of protections for crime victims, into state constitutions.\n\nSix states had Marsy's Law amendments on their ballots Tuesday, all of which passed. Five of these states now will alter their constitutions to include proposed changes that critics say are overly broad and harmful.\n\nMarsy's Law encompasses a number of provisions based on the idea that victims should have equal rights to those of the accused in criminal proceedings. This includes requiring victims to be notified of proceedings involving their case and the release or escape of the accused; to be heard at plea or sentencing hearings; to obtain reasonable protection from the accused, and to be guaranteed a meaningful role in the criminal justice system.\n\nCritics say the protections hamper the justice system through their vague wording, while undermining due process by pitting defendants' rights, which are meant to protect defendants from the state, against those of victims. Notably, the American Civil Liberties Union opposes Marsy's Law, calling it \"poorly drafted\" and \"a threat to existing constitutional rights.\"\n\nMarsy's Law for All national communications adviser Henry Goodwin told VOA News he had never heard a good example of a victim's rights undermining a defendant's rights.\n\n\"The justice system is very adept at balancing rights within the system,\" Goodwin said. \"You know, the victim's rights which Marsy's Law advocates are complementary to defendant's rights.

Marsy's Law is named for his sister Marsalee, who was shot to death by her ex-boyfriend in 1983.\n\nAfter successfully spearheading a 2008 campaign to bring Marsy's Law to California, Nicholas decided to form a national organization with the goal of bringing the amendments to all 50 states, and eventually the U.S. Constitution. Since then, Marsy's Law amendments have passed in Illinois, the Dakotas and Ohio.\n\nThe movement, on a state and national level, is funded by Nicholas' personal wealth. The six campaigns backing Marsy's Law this November all received the vast majority of their money either directly from Nicholas or from Marsy's Law for All, which Goodwin confirmed to VOA News is entirely funded by Nicholas.

The U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions affect two people and one group engaged in \"serious human rights abuses in parts of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Sigal Mandelker, said the department \"remains committed to targeting Russian-backed entities that seek to profit from Russia's illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea.\"\n\nShe added, \"Treasury remains committed to targeting Russian-backed entities that seek to profit from Russia's illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea. Our sanctions are a clear reminder that efforts seeking to normalize investment and economic relationships with those operating in Crimea will not be tolerated and are subject to U.S. and EU sanctions authorities.\"\n\nThe effect of the sanctions is to freeze any U.S. assets held by the individuals or entities, and to prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.\n\nThe individuals targeted for sanctions include Andriy Volodymyrovych Sushko, an officer in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, who is suspected of having \"unlawfully abducted a Crimean Tatar activist who objected to Russia's occupation of Crimea, and having subsequently participated in the abuse of this individual,\" according to the Treasury statement.\n\nThe sanctions also target Aleksander Basov, who is an official of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, a political entity in eastern Ukraine that is not internationally recognized as an autonomous state. Basov is accused of ordering or being complicit in human rights abuses in Russia-controlled Ukraine.\n\nA third individual, Vladimir Nikolaevich Zaritsky, is under sanctions for actions by his company, Limited Liability Company Infrastructure Projects Management Company, for buying and developing property illegally seized from the government of Ukraine.\n\nThe organizations targeted for sanctions largely fall into the category of private investors who are operating in Russian-controlled Crimea without consent of the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe new sanctions announced Thursday followed a contentious press conference by Trump, in which he insisted former U.S. President Barack Obama was responsible for allowing Russia to annex the territory it now controls in eastern Ukraine."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "In Online Ruse, Fake Journalists Tried to Hack Saudi Critic", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/in-online-ruse-fake-journalists-tried-to-hack-saudi-critic/4650614.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:36:56", "body_paragraphs": "Hackers impersonating journalists tried to intercept the communications of a prominent Saudi opposition figure in Washington, The Associated Press has found.\n\nOne attempt involved the fabrication of a fake BBC secretary and an elaborate television interview request; the other involved the impersonation of slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi to deliver a malicious link.\n\nMedia rights defenders denounced the hacking effort, which they said would make it harder for genuine reporters to do their jobs.\n\n\"It's incredibly dangerous to employ this kind of tactic,\" said Elodie Vialle, who heads the technology desk at Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. \"The chilling effect is that people are deterred from speaking to journalists. In the end, it undermines the freedom of information.\"\n\nThe most involved masquerade took place in February of this year, when someone posing as a BBC journalist called \"Tanya Stalin\" emailed Washington-based Saudi dissident Ali AlAhmed inviting him to a live broadcast about Saudi Arabia. Stalin engaged with AlAhmed over several days, sending him a list of proposed topics and talking him through the logistics of his purported television appearance.\n\nAlAhmed said he knew from the beginning that something was up.\n\nFor starters, Stalin said her position was \"Secretary to the Editor In Chief,\" a title that didn't correspond to a job typically done by producers or bookers. Odder still, the message came over Gmail rather than from an official BBC address.\n\nAnd then there was her eyebrow-raising last name.\n\nThe Stalin business threw me off,\" AlAhmed said in a recent interview. \"I asked my wife, who is Russian, and she said: `No one has this name.\"'\n\nAlAhmed was right. The BBC said it wasn't aware of anyone called \"Tanya Stalin\" working for the broadcaster and that the title she claimed to hold did not formally exist. An Associated Press analysis of her messages suggests the interview request was a sloppily executed trap, an attempt to get AlAhmed to click a malicious link and break into his inbox.\n\nAlAhmed believes Saudi Arabia is behind Stalin's emails, as well as dozens of other suspicious messages he has received over the past year. One November 2017 missive purportedly came from Khashoggi, whose killing last month on the grounds of the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has refocused international attention on the brutality of the Arab kingdom's leadership.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington did not return written questions from the AP.\n\nWashington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said the hackers' theft of Khashoggi's identity was \"contemptible.\"\n\nA researcher with internet watchdog Citizen Lab recently reviewed AlAhmed's emails and confirmed they were malicious \u2014 although he stopped short of drawing a link between the different messages or blaming anyone for the hacking campaign.\n\n\"This was a targeted operation designed to gain access to his accounts and private communications,\" said John Scott-Railton, whose group is based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. \"This does appear to be closely linked to his political activities.\"\n\nSome of the messages \u2014 like a prompt to install a \"free security update\" called \"Ninja security\" \u2014 were generic phishing messages of the type used by criminals and spies the world over. But many of the 40-odd malicious messages recovered from AlAhmed's inbox were closely attuned to current events in the Gulf.\n\nMost troubling was a May 31 message dressed up to look like it came from an event photography service, complete with pictures of AlAhmed holding a microphone during a question and answer session featuring the Qatari foreign minister at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nThe photos, which appear to have been pulled off a publicly available video of the event, suggest that the hackers or someone working with them had been tracking AlAhmed's whereabouts closely.\n\n\"That email was really when I felt fear,\" said AlAhmed, who says his work is largely self-funded. \"They are actually physically here. They're looking at me.\"\n\nScott-Railton said the persistence of the hackers \u2014 and the variety of different tactics they employed to try to pry open AlAhmed's inbox \u2014 pointed to a manpower-intensive effort to compromise the Saudi gadfly.\n\n\"Over an extended period of time, humans were tasked with getting into his computer and getting into his head,\" Scott-Railton said.\n\nAs a critic of Saudi Arabia's ruling family, AlAhmed has been a regular on Arabic and English-language cable news for more than a decade. He has long served Washington journalists as a source about the kingdom's problems, especially in relation to extremist propaganda in the country's school textbooks.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a known practitioner of cyberespionage. The country was exposed as a customer of notorious Italian surveillance firm Hacking Team in 2015 and a mysterious Saudi investor has since taken a minority stake in the company, according to a Motherboard report published this year.\n\nRecent reports by Citizen Lab and human rights group Amnesty International have also documented the use of Israeli-made spy software to break into the smartphones of Saudi human rights activists, including Canada-based Omar Abdulaziz, who was working with Khashoggi on several confidential projects before the columnist was killed.\n\nWhoever is behind the bogus Tanya Stalin persona or the fake Jamal Khashoggi emails, the messages give an idea of how the always-fraught overlap between espionage and journalism has evolved in the internet age, with government-backed hackers routinely impersonating journalists or news organizations to hunt their prey. Even the FBI has impersonated reporters to hack its targets, at one point pretending to be an AP journalist to locate a bomb threat hoaxer's computer.\n\nScott-Railton explained that masquerading as a journalist was a perfect way of getting someone to lower their guard and click a link or open an attachment.\n\n\"It ticks all kinds of boxes,\" he said. \"It explains messages out of the blue and as part of communications with journalists you'd expect to receive documents, like questions in advance.\"\n\nThe attempt to hack AlAhmed under Khashoggi's name involved a simple link sent by email , but the Tanya Stalin ruse was unusually involved.\n\nThe hackers created a fake LinkedIn profile with more than 500 connections to corroborate her identity and pass her off as a graduate of journalism schools at Columbia and Berkeley. The profile's picture consisted of a headshot of Souad Mekhennet, a real Washington Post journalist who writes about national security and the Middle East and has covered the aftermath of Khashoggi's death.\n\nIt's not clear why the hackers used Mekhennet's photo in the sham profile or whether they even tried particularly hard to make the \"Tanya Stalin\" persona credible. Stalin did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Neither did whoever was behind the fake Khashoggi email.\n\nBaron, the Washington Post's top editor, said in his statement Wednesday that he condemned the use of Mekhennet's image and Khashoggi's name.\n\n\"To be clear, neither of these distinguished journalists had any involvement whatsoever in these despicable schemes,\" he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US, Turkey Conduct Second Joint Patrol in Manbij", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-turkey-conduct-second-joint-patrol-manbij/4650428.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:36:56", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. and Turkish forces have completed their second joint patrol in the area of Manbij, Syria, where Kurdish militia have been critical to defeating Islamic State fighters.\n\nTwo U.S. military officials confirmed the patrols in northern Syria to VOA on Thursday.

The website was identical to others supporting Amendment 4 in Georgia, Question 1 in Nevada, and State Question 794 in Oklahoma.\n\nThe campaigns all linked back to the website for Marsy's Law for All, a nonprofit organization driving what it calls the victims' rights movement. It recruits and funds local efforts to incorporate Marsy's Law, a controversial set of protections for crime victims, into state constitutions.\n\nSix states had Marsy's Law amendments on their ballots Tuesday, all of which passed. Five of these states now will alter their constitutions to include proposed changes that critics say are overly broad and harmful.\n\nMarsy's Law encompasses a number of provisions based on the idea that victims should have equal rights to those of the accused in criminal proceedings. This includes requiring victims to be notified of proceedings involving their case and the release or escape of the accused; to be heard at plea or sentencing hearings; to obtain reasonable protection from the accused, and to be guaranteed a meaningful role in the criminal justice system.\n\nCritics say the protections hamper the justice system through their vague wording, while undermining due process by pitting defendants' rights, which are meant to protect defendants from the state, against those of victims. Notably, the American Civil Liberties Union opposes Marsy's Law, calling it \"poorly drafted\" and \"a threat to existing constitutional rights.\"\n\nMarsy's Law for All national communications adviser Henry Goodwin told VOA News he had never heard a good example of a victim's rights undermining a defendant's rights.\n\n\"The justice system is very adept at balancing rights within the system,\" Goodwin said. \"You know, the victim's rights which Marsy's Law advocates are complementary to defendant's rights. We're not seeking to undermine or take anything away from defendants. It's not a zero-sum game.\"\n\nMarsy's Law for All was formed in 2009 by Dr. Henry Nicholas, a former Broadcom CEO recently estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $3 billion. Marsy's Law is named for his sister Marsalee, who was shot to death by her ex-boyfriend in 1983.\n\nAfter successfully spearheading a 2008 campaign to bring Marsy's Law to California, Nicholas decided to form a national organization with the goal of bringing the amendments to all 50 states, and eventually the U.S. Constitution. Since then, Marsy's Law amendments have passed in Illinois, the Dakotas and Ohio.\n\nThe movement, on a state and national level, is funded by Nicholas' personal wealth. The six campaigns backing Marsy's Law this November all received the vast majority of their money either directly from Nicholas or from Marsy's Law for All, which Goodwin confirmed to VOA News is entirely funded by Nicholas.

Nearly half of the measures were initiatives, meaning citizens bypassed their state legislatures by gathering enough signatures to put a measure on the ballot.\n\nHere's how it played out:\n\nFlorida: Felon voting rights\n\nPassed: Amendment 4 restored voting rights to most people convicted of serious crimes in Florida after they have served their sentences. Florida was one of four states that disenfranchised felons permanently. The Sunshine State will now gain 1.5 million voters, possibly the largest single expansion of democratic rights in the U.S. since the voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971.\n\nCalifornia: Dialysis profits\n\nFailed: Proposition 8 would have limited California dialysis company profits to 15 percent over operating costs. Any payments above that level would have been cycled back to pay health insurance rebates, improve clinic quality and hire more workers.\n\nMidwest: Legalized recreational marijuana\n\nSplit decision: Measures to legalize recreational marijuana passed in Michigan and failed in North Dakota.\n\nMaine: Universal home care\n\nFailed: Maine rejected a proposal that would have brought universal home care to seniors and those with disabilities, regardless of income level. The measure would have been funded by a 3.8 percent tax on individuals earning more than $128,000 a year.\n\nLouisiana: Non-unanimous juries\n\nPassed: Louisiana ended its practice of allowing juries with dissenting members to convict people charged with felonies, which many critics said was a remnant of the Jim Crow era. Oregon will now become the last state to allow split juries to hand down felony convictions.\n\nTrends\n\nAffordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion\n\nThe trend: Measures to extend Medicaid coverage to people under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, passed in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, but failed in Montana.\n\nRedistricting, voting access, campaign spending\n\nThe trend: Republicans and Democrats across the country mostly succeeded in pushing through measures designed to either reform local politics or nudge elections in their party's favor. With 20 measures on ballots across the country, this was the biggest group of topics facing voters Tuesday night.\n\nVoters in Colorado, Missouri and Michigan decided to establish new redistricting systems for their state legislatures. An anti-gerrymandering measure in Utah was still too close to call.\n\nSeveral measures tightened or eased access to voting for citizens by increasing ID requirements or simplifying registration \u2014 moves that many people saw as partisan tactics. All of these passed. A measure seeking to limit terms in Arkansas' state legislature didn\u2019t make the ballot because it was blocked by that state's Supreme Court.\n\nMeasures to change campaign financing laws passed in Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Mexico and North Dakota, but failed in two states: Colorado voters soundly rejected an amendment that would have loosened limits on campaign contributions in which one candidate was spending more than $1 million of his or her own money, and voters in South Dakota rejected an amendment that would have reduced special-interest money and created a system for publicly financed campaigns, among other changes.\n\nAbortion\n\nSplit decision: Initiatives designed to nearly end abortion in their areas if the federal government ends monetary support passed in Alabama and West Virginia but failed in Oregon."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Immigration Supporters Optimistic After Midterm Results", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/immigration-supporters-optimistic-after-midterm-results-/4650630.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:36:57", "body_paragraphs": "Immigration advocates are measuring success in Tuesday's midterm elections from the state capitals to Washington, D.C., not just by who won, but also by who lost.\n\n\"We saw these patterns repeat from Maine to California, where anti-immigrant state leaders were rejected in favor of legislators who advance a more inclusive vision of our country,\" Kamal Essaheb, director of policy and advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center, said during a call with media Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Eddie Smith of Tennessee, who had voted to block in-state tuition for undocumented students, lost to Democrat Gloria Johnson, a supporter of tuition equality, for a seat in the state's House of Representatives.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republican Gov.

The Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, to be exact.\n\nSo could it be that the object, called Oumuamua, Hawaiian for 'scout', is truly some kind of alien artifact, or an actual space probe sent to spy on all us Earthlings?\n\nHate to be a bummer, but no!\n\nLet's throw away our scientific and journalist objectivity for a moment and admit that most people want the answer to be 'yes.'\n\nThat's why scientists spend so much time looking for extrasolar planets that are like Earth, and why we want to get closer looks at Mars, and send probes to Europa or Enceladus or any place with oceans of liquid water. Researchers and astronomers all want some proof that humans are not all alone in the universe.\n\nBut in this case, based on conversations VOA has had with astronomers, and based on everything scientists know about space rocks, comets, and asteroids, Oumuamua doesn't seem to be acting much differently than any other space rock out there in the void.\n\nBut here's what scisntists do know about Oumuamua, and that might help explain why some scientists are so excited about it, whether it offers proof of alien intelligence or not.\n\nOumuamua was the first interstellar object to visit our solar system. That means it came from another star system like our own. It flew between Mercury and the Sun in November 2017, almost exactly a year ago.\n\nIt moved really quickly, at about 136-thousand kilometers per hour. Michele Bannister from Queen's College in Belfast told VOA that scientists only had about three weeks to get a good look at it.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nOumuamua is reddish, and about 400 meters long. However, it's 10 times longer than it is wide, so basically it looks a bit like a giant, dirty interstellar icicle. In space terms, 400 meters is tiny, so just finding the thing was a big win for astronomers.\n\n\u201cFor decades we\u2019ve theorized that such interstellar objects are out there,\" says NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen \"and now\u2015for the first time\u2015we have direct evidence they exist.\u201d\n\nThat's really interesting, but how did the whole \"aliens\" thing get started? Well, it turns out that Oumuamua is definitely 'unusual' in that it isn't just ambling through the galaxy. It's changing speed and direction by itself. Bannister calls this \"non-gravitational acceleration.\"\n\nIt turns out that's not particularly strange or even unusual. Bannister says this rock is likely filled with the kinds of things that comets and asteroids generally have in abundance. Carbon monoxide, for instance or cyanide. If so, when they get close to the sun and get warm, these gases shoot out like jets in a process called sublimation. This is likely what made Oumuamua look like it was acting under its own power, because it was in a way.\n\nHere's how NASA explains this outgassing acceleration:\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nWe'll never really know\n\nBut that perfectly reasonable explanation didn't stop Harvard scientists Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from putting forth a few possible alternate possibilities for Oumuamua, including one that suggests our interstellar space rock was a lightsail, a giant sail that uses energy from the sun instead of wind to push a vehicle through space.\n\nThey suggest this might be a possibility because some other studies suggest our interstellar wanderer isn't a comet and isn't doing any outgassing. Hence the solar sail idea. And the team does the math to show how Oumuamua might fit the bill.\n\nThe other possibility put forward by Bialy and Loeb is that \"Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\" They do the math here as well to show how Oumuamua's trajectory might make sense if it was aimed our way.\n\nIt's important to note that the paper hasn't been peer reviewed yet, which is the process all scientific research goes through before it gets published by reputable journals like Science, or Nature. That means other scientists in the same field read it over, give input and check on its validity. So we'll see what happens with this paper.\n\nBut as far as Oumuamua goes, it's too small for even our best telescopes to get a look at, so researchers have all the information they'll ever have.\n\nBut don't worry, there are likely a lot more Oumuamua's out there. \u201cThe galaxy is filled with flying rocks,\u201d Bannister says. \"Trillions upon trillions\" of space rocks, ranging in size from a \"skyscraper\" to a planet, are likely roaming around the galaxy. And if we're lucky, Bannister says we should be able to see about one a year.\n\nSo, in a way the Earth is getting visitors from other stars, but they're just random rocks passing through. So, no aliens, but still pretty really great science."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Experts Turn Old Coal Mines into Carbon-Sucking Forests", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-turn-old-coal-mines-into-carbon-sucking-forests/4649566.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:37:01", "body_paragraphs": "Dramatic steps are needed to avoid potentially catastrophic levels of global warming, says the latest report from the U.N.

But the chasing got harder and harder, and now he spends his time making nets for other fishermen at his workshop, at the end of a dirt path next to his ex-wife's house.\n\nThe house is on CB Daniels Sr. Road, one of several named after two of the fishing clans that have held sway for decades in this small coastal town. Besides CB Daniels Sr. Road, there's ER Daniels Road and just plain Daniels Road. In Frog's family, there's Tink Tillett Road and Rondal Tillett Road.\n\nOnce upon a time, these fishing families were pioneers. In the 1970s and 1980s, they built summer flounder into a major catch for the region. The 15 brothers and sisters of the Daniels clan parlayed the business into a multinational fishing company, and three years ago they sold it to a Canadian outfit for tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBut for Frog Tillett and almost everyone else in these parts, there's not much money to be made fishing offshore here anymore.\n\nForty years ago, Tillett fished for summer flounder in December and January in waters near Wanchese, then followed the fish north as the weather warmed. In recent years, however, fewer summer flounder have traveled as far south in the winter, and the most productive area has shifted north, closer to Martha's Vineyard and the southern shore of Long Island.\n\nReuters has spent more than a year scouring decades of maritime temperature readings, fishery records and other little-used data to create a portrait of the planet's hidden climate disruption \u2014 in the rarely explored depths of the seas that cover more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface. The reporting has come to a disturbing conclusion: Marine life is facing an epic dislocation.\n\nThe U.S. North Atlantic is a prime example. In recent years, at least 85 percent of the nearly 70 federally tracked species there had shifted north or deeper, or both, when compared to the norm over the past half-century, according to the Reuters analysis of U.S. fisheries data. But this great migration is not just off the coast of America. Pushed out of their traditional habitats by the dramatically rising ocean temperatures and other fallout from climate change, summer flounder are part of a global disruption of marine species that threatens livelihoods, cultures and the delicate balance of the oceans themselves.\n\nA mirror image of the flotillas of desperate people trying to escape deadly conflicts, this is a refugee crisis going on beneath the surface of the seas. And much of it has happened in the time it took a child to be born and graduate from high school.\n\nTillett, threading lead weights onto the bottom of a net, remembers the days of plenty up and down the Atlantic coast, catching summer flounder up north but knowing there were plenty more back home.\n\n\"Then, all of a sudden, everything starts moving that way, and nothing is left down here.\"\n\n'There ain't no flounder around here no more'\n\nFew tourists traveling on Route 64 from the North Carolina mainland to the Hatteras beaches venture into Wanchese.\n\nIt isn't even a town, officially. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, says 1,600 people live here, many of them in one-story cinder-block homes, not the big beach houses on stilts, known euphemistically as cottages, a few miles away.\n\nMost mornings, Danielses and Tilletts and Etheridges, another of the fishing clans, crowd the restaurant down by the marina.\n\nLongtime flounder skipper Steve Daniels pulls up. Steve bought his first trawler in 1978 and started flounder fishing that summer. That was the year Wanchese fishermen decided there was money in the fish. In 1977, they had caught zero pounds. In 1978, they caught 12 million pounds, and in 1979, their catch approached 17 million pounds. And that doesn't count the millions of pounds they landed during the warmer months in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey ports.\n\nOver the years, however, the longer trips north needed to find the fish, among other factors, made the fishing increasingly unprofitable.\n\n\"There ain't no flounder around here no more \u2014 they all up there in Rhode Island,\" Steve says. \"I got the hell out of it three years ago.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, summer flounder stocks were on the verge of collapse after being overfished in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily by Wanchese and other North Carolina fishermen.\n\nToday, after years of severe limits on catches, the species is relatively healthy. Unfortunately for Wanchese, it has rebounded in an area well north of where the crews here started fishing for summer flounder.\n\nBut that hasn't made a difference to arcane rules on summer flounder catches.\n\nNearly a quarter-century ago, when the fishermen of Wanchese were riding high, the U.S. government set quotas for summer flounder. It dictated that about a quarter of all the flounder caught in U.S. waters must be \"landed,\" or brought to shore, in North Carolina, no matter where they were caught.\n\nSome modest changes being considered for next year could reduce North Carolina's landings to one-fifth of the national total. But the very makeup of federal fishery-management bodies has stymied greater changes.\n\nSummer flounder is managed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, one of three federally mandated councils that operate along the East Coast. Each council has about 20 members made up of fishermen, scientists, regulators, ecologists and a strong bloc of wholesale fish dealers. The councils' size and the members' competing interests make them slow to act. And often, the fishermen and especially the dealers are reluctant to shift an economic benefit from one region to another, as in the case of summer flounder, whose stock has shifted away from mid-Atlantic waters.\n\nKiley Dancy, a fishery management specialist with the mid-Atlantic council, says there has been much resistance to shifting the landings to states closer to where the fish are now located.\n\n\"Many would like for it to stay the same,\" she says. The proposed changes, she says, \"better reflect the location of the biomass\" \u2014 that is, the area where the species is most likely to be found.\n\nIf adopted, the changes could take effect in late 2019 or early 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, summer flounder continue their inexorable move north. Is it, as with so many other species, because of the warming of the water?\n\n\"Absolutely. Looking at the data panorama, actually, I think this is fairly well established. I think that any intelligent conversation kind of starts with that just as a matter of fact,\" says Joel Fodrie of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina.\n\nRutgers University fish ecologist Malin Pinsky has been studying how fisheries have shifted around the North Atlantic for the better part of a decade. It was his work, adapting federal trawler sampling dating to 1968, that first identified where the centers of various species were located and illustrated the wholesale shift of species north.\n\nPinsky is well aware that fish, which can swim wherever they want, live in complex ecosystems, and attributing those shifts simply to climate change would be oversimplifying matters.\n\nStill, he says, his work shows that temperature change is almost certainly the single largest factor. In 2013, he published a research paper that calculated that 40 percent of the northerly shift was attributed to temperature change.\n\n\"Actually, that's impressively high ... that something as simple as temperature explained a lot of the pattern, given that there's fishing, there's predators, there's prey, de-oxygenation, pollution and changing currents. There's so much going on.\"\n\nIn the case of flounder, the slow rebuilding of the stock has also resulted in a more mature population than the one that existed in the 1980s, according to trawling surveys conducted by the federal government. And older and larger summer flounder tend to live farther north than younger fish, says Fodrie, the UNC professor, who's been working these waters for the better part of 20 years.\n\nRegulators vs. fishermen\n\nAmong the Wanchese breakfast crowd, few names elicit a lengthier string of expletives than Louis Daniel, former executive director of the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries. Many fishermen feel he imposed overly strict management of the local catches when he was in charge.\n\nDaniel, unrelated to the Daniels family, knows he is an unpopular man among commercial fishermen. \"They think I wanted to put them out of business, that profit should always be put ahead of protecting the resource,\" he says.\n\nBut, he says, there is little doubt that there are fewer fish in this region than there once were. And some species have clearly been affected by climate change in the region.\n\nConsider striped bass, which he says is a perfect example of how climate change can dislocate fisheries management.\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when recreational anglers routinely caught striped bass along the beaches in North Carolina. But since the beginning of the century, the number of striped bass has steadily declined.\n\n\"North Carolina has not caught any striped bass in five or six years or more,\" he says. \"There has been nothing on the beach.\"\n\nThey are, however, routinely found in Canadian waters, which was unheard of a generation ago.\n\nIn early 2010, a small population of the fish was still wintering off the Carolina coast. Steve Daniels took his trawler three miles offshore into federal waters. Over a 10-day period, he illegally caught about 12,000 pounds of striped bass, landing the fish here in Wanchese, according to the United States Attorney's Office.\n\nLast August, Steve pleaded guilty to the charges and agreed to pay $95,000 in restitution. He was sentenced to five years' probation.\n\nGambles pay off\n\nThrough the years, the families in Wanchese haven't been afraid to gamble on a hunch.\n\nMikey Daniels was in high school when a local named Willie Etheridge Jr. decided to make a go at longlining for swordfish.\n\n\"That was '63, '64,\" he says. \"We were stacking them up like cordwood. I mean, three or four hundred fish in a stack, and they did it by hand.\"\n\nOn Dec. 23, 1970, however, the Food and Drug Administration announced that tests showed that swordfish flesh was tainted with extremely high levels of mercury, a toxic metal. And overnight, the swordfish boom went bust.\n\nIt took a few years, but Wanchese's entrepreneurial fishermen got to work on summer flounder. This time it was Mikey's father, Malcolm Daniels, who took the lead, after struggling for years. At one point, Mikey remembers, his father was so poor there was a collection in town to raise money to help the family.\n\nEventually, though, his father bought a 65-foot wooden boat that he converted into a trawler that could drag large nets behind it. And before long, he was buying metal shrimp boats from Texas and converting them to trawlers too.\n\nThe family also added a trucking company to drive fish to New York and Boston.\n\n\"I was 16 years old driving tractor-trailers. My brothers were too,\" he says. \"We would get to New York, traveling in a group, you know.\n\nThe Daniels siblings took over the Wanchese Seafood Company when their father died in 1986. By the time their mother died in 2006, the family had expanded into boats and seafood wholesalers in Virginia, Massachusetts, Alaska and Argentina. When they sold up, they all became millionaires \u2014 a rarity in Wanchese.\n\nThe Wanchese fishermen fought hard for their place in the flounder business, but they started fading this decade.\n\nIn 2013, fishermen from North Carolina accounted for 64 percent of the summer flounder landed in the state, down from 80 percent just a few years earlier.\n\nBy 2016, it was less than half. Fishermen from New Jersey and Massachusetts accounted for 35 percent that year, up from nothing a decade earlier.\n\nA winner in New England\n\nOn a cold December day hundreds of miles north of Wanchese, snow whips through the New Bedford, Mass., fishing fleet. The wind howls and bangs through the rigging of the boats docked two or three deep along the city's working piers.\n\nMost of the boats are dark. But the Sao Paulo's wheelhouse glows orange. Inside, skipper Antonio Borges is preparing to leave as soon as the weather breaks.\n\nThe 60-year-old has just returned from 11 days at sea. It could have been a three-day trip if he were allowed to land his catch in Massachusetts, but the law prohibits that.\n\nInstead, he left New Bedford and steamed less than a day before reaching the waters south of Long Island. He dragged his nets in about 50 fathoms of water and filled his hold with summer flounder. Then he turned south for a couple of days to offload some fish in Virginia. Two days after that, he offloaded flounder at the Beaufort, N.C., docks, before turning around and heading home.\n\nA day after tying up in New Bedford, he's back on the boat getting ready to go to sea.\n\nBorges is fortunate that he can even catch the summer flounder: He bought landing permits from North Carolina and Virginia fishermen. In a perfect world, he says, Massachusetts and other New England and mid-Atlantic states would have a bigger quota.\n\nStill, Borges says he doesn't mind. He owns a boat large enough to make those trips, even in the foulest of winter weather. And besides, he's invested in the status quo \u2014 he paid for one of those landing permits.\n\nSo, even though his time on the seas would be much shorter, he said the distributions of landings shouldn't change. \"It's not going to happen, and it shouldn't happen,\" he says. \"Because the states that we bought the license from, we already knew that we had to go to those states and deliver the fish.\"\n\nTraveling the distance from the Northeast to North Carolina benefits fishermen like Borges in bigger boats. At 75 feet and specifically designed for fishing on the high seas, his would loom over many of the flounder trawlers that steamed out of Wanchese in the 1980s.\n\nPlus, he says, the Wanchese fishermen established the business and the North Carolina economy is entitled to benefit from that work, even if it's no longer feasible for the fishermen to work the waters as much as they once did, he said.\n\n\"We go to North Carolina, we bring jobs,\" he says. \"Wherever we go, we bring business: lumpers to unload the fish, truckers to truck the fish, fuel, food. The economy grows wherever a fishing boat goes. It brings business, and we shouldn't change that.\"\n\nOutside, the snow turns the docks and the decks white. The Portuguese immigrant shrugs.\n\n\"Look, it is 21 degrees today. Oh my God, it's cold. You know what? This harbor used to freeze every single winter. It would freeze for weeks on end.\"\n\nNow it doesn't.\n\nBorges was 18 when his father took delivery of the Sao Paulo in 1977 from a Louisiana shipyard.\n\nSince then, he has married and had two daughters. They married and had three daughters. Now, at the tail end of his career, he reflects on what has changed.\n\n\"Forty-two years I have been doing this, 60 years old, and I still love it.\"\n\nThe most notable change, he says, is that fishermen are no longer the biggest threat to fisheries.\n\n\"We were the problem, in the '70s and '80s. We grew so much that we became a problem, and if the laws didn't change, yeah, we were going to catch the last fish, I guarantee you we were.\n\n\"But you know what? We're not the problem now. Climate change is the problem now. It is climate; it is water temperature. There are southern species that are coming north, and the species that were here have moved north.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "NASA Conducts Quiet Sonic Boom Tests Near Texas Gulf Coast", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-conducts-quiet-sonic-boom-tests-near-texas-gulf-coast/4647187.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:37:03", "body_paragraphs": "NASA is monitoring how residents near the Texas Gulf Coast react to quiet sonic booms from an experimental aircraft that could reduce commercial flight times by half.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reports that the space agency on Monday launched a two-week research project on quiet supersonic research flights near Galveston.

That will now be optional under the new policies.

Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin.

American security experts said the Russians changed tactics this year.\n\nReuters found that Facebook and Google took down 436 ads from May through October related to 34 U.S. House of Representatives contests declared competitive last month by RealClearPolitics, which tracks political opinion polls.\n\nOf the 258 removed ads with start and end dates, ads remained on Google an average of eight days and Facebook 15 days, according to data Reuters collected from the databases.\n\nBased on ranges in the databases, the 436 ads were displayed up to 20.5 million times and cost up to $582,000, amounting to a fraction of the millions of dollars spent online in those races.\n\nAsked for comment, Google said it is committed to bringing greater transparency to political ads. Facebook said the database is a way the company is held accountable, \"even if it means our mistakes are on display.\"\n\nIn some cases, the companies' automated scans did not identify banned material such as hateful speech or images of poor quality before ads went live.\n\nAds that are OK when scanned may also become noncompliant if they link to a website that later breaks down.\n\nGoogle's database covers $54 million in spending by U.S. campaigns since May and Facebook $354 million, according to their databases.\n\nFacebook's figure is larger partly because its database includes ads not only from federal races but also for state contests, national issues and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nThe databases generally do not say why a particular ad was removed, and only Facebook shows copies of yanked ads.\n\nThe American Conservative Union political organization, which had 136 ads removed through Sunday on Facebook, said some commercials contained a brief shot of comedian Kathy Griffin holding a decapitated head meant to portray U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nRemoving the bloody image resolved the violation for sensational content, and the organization said it had no qualms about Facebook's screening.\n\nSome removals were errors.

At a family reunion, my grandma pulled out a piece of paper with a list of signatures \u2014 signatures required to trigger a recall election against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who\u2019d just inspired massive protests by ramming through a bill that stripped public sector employees of their right to bargain collectively.\n\nShe asked me to sign the recall petition, and I did.\n\nThree years later, while I was working for a small political magazine in D.C., I wrote an innocuous blog post about Walker. The Walker campaign called the magazine\u2019s managing editor \u2014 my boss\u2019s boss \u2014 and complained that I couldn\u2019t write about the governor because I had signed the recall petition three years earlier. The managing editor was furious with me for failing to disclose my actions as an unemployed 22-year-old. I was terrified, sure that I was going to get fired.\n\nThat\u2019s the type of guy Walker is. He governed Wisconsin with the same vindictive pettiness, transparent corruption and laser-like focus on further oppressing already marginalized people that we now see in the Trump administration (there\u2019s a word for this style of governance.) He was the sad, preservative-laced ham sandwich in the otherwise unassuming brown paper bag of Wisconsin politics. He would tell you, unconvincingly, that he needs his black and orange Harley Davidson jacket when he is about to go into a controlled slide on his hog. He is Miracle Whip personified. He\u2019s the kind of guy who\u2019d call your boss\u2019 boss to try to get you fired.\n\nNow he\u2019s the one out of a job.\n\nBeneath his corn-fed, \u201caw shucks\u201d facade, Walker is one of the most conniving figures to emerge from conservative politics in the past decade.\n\nWalker\u2019s loss on Tuesday night had a sort of poetic justice: After the 2016 election, Walker and Republicans in the state legislature passed a rule tightening the state\u2019s recount law. The new law requires that candidates must lose by 1 percent or less to ask for a recount. On Tuesday, Walker lost the governorship to State Superintendent Tony Evers by 1.1 percentage points.\n\nWalker and his allies will surely consider the devastation he brought to Wisconsin over the past eight years a success. Taken together, Walker\u2019s legacy adds up to eight years of ruin for Wisconsin\u2019s working classes, for people of color and for the environment \u2014 all in service of further enriching the already-rich.\n\nBeneath his corn-fed, \u201caw shucks\u201d facade, Walker is one of the most conniving figures to emerge from conservative politics in the past decade. It will take decades to repair the damage he and his allies did to my home state. And much of what he broke can never be made whole again.\n\nThroughout his two terms as governor, Walker has remained consistent in his core political strategy: promising jobs that will never appear. Look at Walker\u2019s election-year gambit: to bring Taiwanese electronics manufacturer FoxConn to Wisconsin with promises of well-paying, high-tech jobs for Wisconsin workers.\n\nReality has not lived up to those expectations. FoxConn promised to create 13,000 jobs at its Wisconsin factory at an average salary of $53,875. In exchange, Walker\u2019s administration awarded FoxConn more than $3 billion in state tax breaks and credits \u2014 equaling more than $230,000 per job the company promised. Walker could have used that money to fund a public works program to employ more than four times as many people, at the same salary, for the same cost of the FoxConn deal.\n\nLet\u2019s just say that, under Walker, Wisconsin underperformed its Democrat-run cousin, Minnesota, on nearly every meaningful metric: Non-farm job growth. Median income. Population growth. Median hourly wages. The share of people with health insurance.\n\nI suspect that one reason Walker failed so badly is that although he is conniving to his core, he is not smart. Think back to when he took a prank call from someone pretending to be David Koch. Or when, as Milwaukee County executive, he signed a letter to a Jewish constituent with, \u201cThank you again and Molotov.\u201d Or when he claimed he got his bald spot from bumping his head on a kitchen cabinet door. Walker has a Ph.D. in power lust and an \u201cI tried!\u201d sticker in political acumen.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even good at hiding his corruption. During his campaign for governor, while serving as county executive, Walker\u2019s staff set up a secret wireless router in his public office to communicate about the campaign using taxpayer resources. One of Walker\u2019s aides at the time was sentenced to six months in prison for felony misconduct.\n\nWalker was a cheap date for corporate executives in search of friendlier laws. A John Doe investigation revealed that after a billionaire lead producer gave $750,000 to a conservative group supporting Walker and his party in the 2012 recall elections, Walker and his party passed a measure that retroactively shielded paint makers from liability.\n\nSo, on Tuesday night, Walker did what he has always done, from the moment he decided to pursue a career in politics: He failed. I hope some of his supporters, including some of my own family members, will now wake up to the fact that they were duped."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "'Avengers 4' Co-Director Joe Russo Says We May Not See A Trailer This Year", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/avengers-4-director-joe-russo-says-we-may-not-see-a-trailer-this-year_us_5be4a977e4b0769d24cb0f33", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:37:11", "body_paragraphs": "Say it ain\u2019t so, Joe.\n\nWhile participating in an Instagram Q&A session, Joe Russo, the co-director of Marvel\u2019s highly anticipated and still-untitled \u201cAvengers 4\u201d film, revealed a bit of what to expect from the follow-up to \u201cInfinity War.\u201d The most surprising reveal during the interview might be when we\u2019ll see a trailer.\n\n\u201cYou may or may not see it before the calendar turns 2019,\u201d Russo said.\n\nThe trailer for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d came out in November 2017, and the film was released April 27 (its original release date was May 4).

Her statements came about a half hour after Diamond and Silk, two YouTube-based Trump supporters, advocated that Acosta\u2019s badge be pulled during an appearance on the Fox Business channel.\n\nTrump is known to watch a great deal of cable television, especially Fox channels, and to make decisions apparently based on that information.\n\nThe White House did not respond to multiple queries about the origin of the video. Nor did it say whether the urging by Diamond and Silk played a role in the decision to punish Acosta.\n\nIt also would not explain why press officers managing Wednesday\u2019s news conference asked the intern to try to wrestle the microphone away from Acosta, rather than just turning it off remotely from the board that controls the audio.\n\nDouglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, called the White House\u2019s response \u201cunprecedented\u201d in the modern era. \u201cThis is President Trump targeting Acosta because he asks tough questions.

Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said Trump\u2019s intention at the press conference was clearly to rile up his political base after his party lost control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cHad it been a true effort to inform the American public, the president would\u2019ve announced the removal of his attorney general.

Mission accomplished.\u201d\n\nIn her statement Wednesday evening as well as a new one Thursday, Sanders claimed that Acosta\u2019s credentials were pulled because of his interaction with the female intern who tried to take away the microphone.\n\n\u201cWe will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Sanders wrote Wednesday night.\n\nOn Thursday, she wrote: \u201cThe question is: Did the reporter make contact or not? The video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement.\u201d\n\nBut a review of the video clearly shows that Acosta did not place \u201chis hands on a young woman\u201d \u2015 but, rather, that he moved the mic away from her as she tried to grab it and that his left hand briefly came into contact with the crook of her elbow as he gestured toward the president.\n\nInfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson posted this to his Twitter account on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn the clip originally posted by InfoWars\u2019 Paul Joseph Watson, the zoomed-in video stops as Acosta\u2019s hand touches the intern\u2019s arm, making that contact appear more forceful than it does in the longer wide-angle clip.\n\nInfoWars did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nAymann Ismail, a staff writer and former video producer at Slate.com, wrote that the zoomed-in video appears to slow down and then speed up, which also makes the contact appear more energetic than it was. He wrote later that the effect could have been the result of the video being downloaded and shifted to a different frame rate, rather than due to malicious editing.\n\nInfoWars is a conspiracy theory site best known for claiming \u2015 falsely \u2015 that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was staged and that the 20 elementary school children and six staff gunned down there were actually alive and well somewhere. The site and its operator, Alex Jones, are being sued by parents of those children for defamation.\n\nThe site is also known for its sales of dubious vitamin supplements (\u201cBrain Force Plus.\u201d \u201cSuper Male Vitality.\u201d) and is a strong supporter of Trump and white nationalist politics generally. Trump was interviewed by Jones in December 2015 when he was still just a candidate in the GOP presidential primaries. He told the conspiracy theorist, \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d\n\nBrinkley said that not even President Richard Nixon, who famously mistrusted the news media, tried to pull credentials from reporters. Nixon limited access \u2015 for example, he took only print journalists who had written favorable stories about him on his groundbreaking trip to China \u2015 but he did not restrict individual journalists\u2019 ability to do their jobs, Brinkley said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Donald Trump Doesn't Care About 'Loyalty'; He Cares About Himself", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-donald-trump-jeff-sessions_us_5be4a57be4b0769d24cb0cd3", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:37:11", "body_paragraphs": "Taylor Hill via Getty Images Jeff Sessions was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Once in office, he may have been his most effective Cabinet member.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump delivered his first counterpunch to the results of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections by forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions, his embattled attorney general. With a new Democrat-controlled House of Representatives that will strengthen the Russia investigations against him, the president\u2019s firing of Sessions \u2015 the departing attorney general\u2019s resignation letter made clear it was the president\u2019s decision \u2015 demonstrates that Trump is preparing for and even stoking, as is his tendency, a vicious battle.\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Sessions has often been strained and combative, a surprising development given how much the two men agree on but also revealing of the president\u2019s only real agenda: himself.\n\nSessions was an early endorser of Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions, a key step toward legitimacy for Trump\u2019s candidacy when so many other Republican leaders were hesitant to get behind his campaign. For Trump, the endorsement signaled Sessions\u2019 loyalty \u2015 the characteristic he values in others above all else.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt either that Sessions had a long career advancing a far-right political agenda that matches so neatly with Trump\u2019s own policy goals, to the extent that he has any. As senator, Sessions opposed almost all forms of immigration, a hard-line stance that put him out of step with even most Republicans at the time. Earlier in his career, Sessions\u2019 nomination to a federal judgeship had been prevented by the Senate due to allegations of racism during his time as a U.S. attorney in Alabama. That black mark on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 would have kept Sessions out of most Republican presidents\u2019 Cabinets. But it may have actually helped endear Sessions to Trump, who seems to think the real problem of American racism is how the charge of it hurts white Americans.\n\nDespite all this common ground, Sessions lost Trump\u2019s favor shortly after becoming attorney general when he recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in early 2017. Sessions\u2019 critics rightly praised his decision as a proper adherence to the law and a hopeful sign he would honor his obligation to the American people. But for Trump, Sessions\u2019 recusal represented a personal betrayal and a violation of what he saw as Sessions\u2019 duty to him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What kind of a man is this?\u2019\u201d Trump ranted to Fox News in an interview this year about how Sessions\u2019 recusal had infuriated him. On Twitter, Trump has blasted Sessions as \u201cVERY weak\u201d and \u201cDISGRACEFUL,\u201d while privately mocking him as \u201cMr. Magoo.\u201d All of this pointed toward Sessions\u2019 eventual firing. The only question was when.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Sessions has pursued and accomplished Trump\u2019s political agenda more effectively than any other Cabinet member. On immigration, Sessions, working with presidential adviser Stephen Miller, set in place the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for illegal immigration that led to the forced separation of families at the southern border and has created a tremendous backlog of cases in immigration courts. He has gone after MS-13 with vigor while loosening oversight of law enforcement officials. Sessions has redefined whose civil rights the Justice Department would protect and backed voting rights restrictions.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images Sessions had a long career advancing a far-right political agenda that matches neatly with Trump\u2019s own policy goals, but Sessions lost Trump\u2019s favor shortly after becoming attorney general when he recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in early 2017.\n\nFor a presidential administration that can\u2019t point to a lot of political accomplishments, Sessions achieved notable successes for Trumpism. But those don\u2019t matter much to a man whose presidency has always really been less about any coherent policy agenda than it is about the simple pursuit of his own self-interests and, with increasing evidence of a variety of scandals, his self-protection.\n\nAccordingly, that meant Sessions had to go, especially with the incoming Democratic majority able to provide some level of protection for special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation. In choosing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general in Sessions\u2019 place, Trump made clear that the only thing he\u2019s looking for in the position is someone who will work to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nWhitaker has certainly indicated he is committed to that task. In an op-ed written for CNN in 2017, Whitaker wrote that Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation was \u201cgoing too far.\u201d Whitaker has also voiced his opposition to Mueller\u2019s team possibly investigating the president and his family members\u2019 finances, one of Trump\u2019s biggest concerns. \u201cThe president is absolutely correct,\u201d Whitaker wrote of Trump\u2019s statement that such a move would be a \u201cviolation.\u201d Elsewhere, Whitaker has expressed his support for decreasing Mueller\u2019s budget so much that the investigations can\u2019t continue.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s willingness to be Trump\u2019s defender rather than the law\u2019s is certainly why he has been chosen. It\u2019s also yet another clear sign that Trump knows he\u2019s guilty and needs to assemble the most loyal team around him, especially inside the Justice Department.\n\nAs a man who built his business career and public persona on lies and criminality, Trump\u2019s attention to his ego and his self-protection are one and the same. In so many ways, Sessions showed his loyalty to the president, but in one crucial decision he did not go along with Trump\u2019s plan to place himself above the law. That\u2019s what mattered most to the president."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "George Conway Slams Trump In Op-Ed: Attorney General Appointment Is 'Unconstitutional'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-conway-new-york-times-op-ed_us_5be47732e4b0e843889555ac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:37:12", "body_paragraphs": "George Conway, the husband of White House adviser \ufeffKellyanne Conway, lambasted President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in a fiery op-ed in The New York Times.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional.

Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor who will now oversee special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, had served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff since September 2017.\n\nConway and Katyal\u2019s central argument is that a principal officer, such as acting attorney general of the United States, must be confirmed by the Senate. By evading such a procedure, Conway argues, it \u201cdefies one of the one of the explicit checks and balances set out in the Constitution, a provision designed to protect us all against the centralization of government power.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed says the American people \u201ccannot tolerate such an evasion of the Constitution\u2019s very explicit, textually precise design.

Nathan Deal on Thursday morning, and it is effective at 11:59 a.m.\n\nThe state said Kemp will not perform any election-related duties Thursday.\n\nThe announcement came ahead of a scheduled hearing Thursday for a lawsuit in which five Georgia voters asked that Kemp be barred from exercising his duties as the state\u2019s chief elections officer in any future management of his own election tally.\n\nDemocratic candidate Stacey Abrams has pointed to ballots that have yet to be counted and says there\u2019s still the possibility of a December runoff in one of the nation\u2019s marquee midterm races.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nIn an interview with WSB Radio on Thursday, Kemp said he and his campaign are declaring victory because it isn\u2019t possible for Abrams to pick up enough votes to force a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign has said there are still enough uncounted votes to force a runoff and that they need to pick up about 15,000 votes to do so.\n\nKemp said his rival\u2019s campaign is using \u201cold math.\u201d Without providing specifics, he said in the radio interview that the number \u201cis actually more like 30,000 votes.\u201d\n\nThe Abrams campaign continues to accuse Kemp of improperly using his current post as secretary of state.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the election.\n\n\u201cWe are declaring victory,\u201d Kemp aide Ryan Mahoney told reporters on a conference call late Wednesday, after a day of the campaigns, media and partisan observers scrambling for information about outstanding votes across Georgia\u2019s 159 counties. Another campaign official, Austin Chambers, added: \u201cThe message here is pretty simple: This election is over, and the results are clear.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo retorted a few hours later that the Kemp campaign offered \u201cno proof\u201d other than nonspecific provisional ballots counts released by Kemp\u2019s official state office.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s offered ... no indication of why we should take him at his word,\u201d Groh-Wargo said. \u201cThe sitting secretary of state has declared himself\u201d the winner.\n\nThe standoff leaves open the possibility of litigation as Abrams\u2019 campaign has pushed for the continued counting of absentee, mail-in and provisional ballots and renewed its concerns that Kemp remains the chief elections officer supervising his own election, a race already marked by disputes over the voting process.\n\nIf a runoff is necessary, the second round would take place Dec. 4, extending Abrams\u2019 bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history while Kemp looks to maintain the GOP\u2019s domination in a state where Democrats haven\u2019t won a governor\u2019s race since 1998.\n\nPartisan observers nationally have watched intently for clues about just how much of a battleground Georgia can be in the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nWith reported votes exceeding 3.9 million \u2014 almost 95 percent of Georgia\u2019s 2016 presidential turnout \u2014 Kemp has just more than 50 percent.\n\nBefore the Kemp campaign declared victory Wednesday, Groh-Wargo estimated that about 15,000 votes separate Kemp from a runoff. She says at least that many outstanding absentee and mail-in ballots remained to be counted.\n\nKemp\u2019s spokeswoman in the secretary of state\u2019s office, Candice Broce, said that by Wednesday afternoon the number of uncounted absentee and mail-in ballots was less than 2,000 \u2014 with her boss still above the 50 percent threshold.\n\nBroce said about 22,000 provisional ballots have yet to be processed, according to a canvass of county officials across the state. Mahoney asserted that those numbers make it impossible for Abrams to pick up enough votes to deny Kemp an outright victory.\n\nIn 2016, with a slightly larger electorate, there were 16,739 provisional ballots. Of those, 7,592 were counted. State and campaign officials said they expected a much higher proportion to be counted this year.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has not released a county-by-county breakdown of provisional ballots, but Abrams\u2019 campaign said they believe they are concentrated in metro Atlanta counties where Abrams won a large share of the vote. Broce said Kemp\u2019s office is working on releasing more detailed information.\n\nThe lawsuit at issue Thursday in an Atlanta federal court comes from voters who sued Kemp on Election Day alleging that Kemp presiding over an election in which he is a candidate \u201cviolates a basic notion of fairness.\u201d The plaintiffs are asking the court to block Kemp from having anything more to do with managing his election.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what Kemp\u2019s practical role was in the election tally. Local officials are responsible for counting the votes, including provisional ballots. County officials have until next Tuesday to certify their results and send them to Kemp\u2019s office.

Private gun sales must be completed through a licensed firearms dealer, requiring a background check and mandatory waiting period. The state maintains permanent records of firearm sales.\n\n\u2022 In 2016, Governor Brown signed a law expanding the prohibition on assault weapons and regulating the sale of ammunition.

Whitaker, the attorney general\u2019s chief of staff, jockeyed over the last two months to replace his boss by forging a close relationship with the White House, where he was seen as a reliable political ally. On Wednesday, President Trump fired Jeff Sessions and named Mr. Whitaker acting attorney general, rewarding his loyalty.\n\nInside the Justice Department, senior officials, including Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, have viewed Mr. Whitaker with intense suspicion. Before his current job at the Justice Department, Mr. Whitaker, a former college football tight end, was openly hostile on television and social media toward the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and was seen by department officials as a partisan and a White House spy.\n\nThe special counsel is leading the investigation into whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates conspired with Russia during 2016 election and whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry. Now Mr. Whitaker will oversee Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, prompting concerns that he could move swiftly to shut it down or hobble it, despite serious questions about his own potential conflicts in supervising it.\n\n[Read more about how Mr. Sessions\u2019s firing could affect the Russia investigation.]\n\nIn August 2017, Mr. Whitaker highlighted on Twitter a Philly.com opinion article with the headline \u201cNote to Trump\u2019s Lawyer: Do Not Cooperate With Mueller Lynch Mob.\u201d In his tweet, Mr. Whitaker wrote that it was \u201cworth a read.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Lina Hidalgo, a 27-Year-Old Latina, Will Lead Harris County, Texas\u2019 Biggest", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/lina-hidalgo-harris-county.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-08 18:37:22", "body_paragraphs": "Lina Hidalgo never thought she would work in politics or run for office.\n\nShe and her family fled their home country of Colombia as a drug war raged, arriving in the United States in 2005.

Democratic victories in governors\u2019 races also improved the chances of Medicaid expansion in Kansas and Wisconsin, and all but ensured it in Maine. As a result, Medicaid could see its biggest enrollment bump since the health law began allowing expansion in 2014.\n\nFor all the campaign warfare over the health law\u2019s effect on insurance premiums and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Medicaid has remained quite popular. In a Kaiser poll last month, 56 percent of people across the 17 states that had not yet expanded Medicaid said they favored doing so.

The people in this group practiced body scans and mindful walking, in addition to the usual quiet, seated meditations. Like those in the exercise group, they attended a weekly session on campus, but most of their meditations were completed at home.\n\nBoth of these programs lasted for two months, which, in this study, took people through September and October and into the early days of November.\n\nThen, with winter on the horizon, the volunteers, including those in the control group, wore an activity monitor for another week. None of them knew that the study\u2019s aim was to track their activities; they thought it was looking at colds.\n\nBut the two programs did seem to have had an influence, according to data from the monitors. Most noticeably, the men and the women in the control group were much less active now, in the late fall, than they had been in the summer, averaging almost 18 fewer minutes a day of walking and otherwise moving about.\n\nBut the men and women in the other two groups had not become quite so inactive, although they were no longer being asked to exercise or meditate. They were moving a bit less than they had been in the summertime, but only by about six minutes a day.\n\nThese results surprised the researchers, says Jacob Meyer, an assistant professor of kinesiology at Iowa State, who conducted the study with Bruce Barrett and other colleagues.

About 12 percent of children in America now carry a diagnosis of A.D.H.D, and there was a 40-fold increase in childhood bipolar disorder diagnoses between 1994 and 2003. Five times as many children are now prescribed psychostimulant and antipsychotic medications as were in the 1980s. Today, a quarter of children and teenagers take prescription drugs regularly, and seven percent of older adolescents and young adults report abusing opioids \u2014 most of whom were initially prescribed them by a doctor.\n\nWith millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life?\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of factors that have gotten us here. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has taken an active, sometimes dubious, role in defining and promoting new diagnoses, through direct-to-consumer advertising and physician outreach efforts.\n\nOften overlooked, however, are how the psychologies of doctors and patients contribute. Clinical encounters that don\u2019t end with a definitive diagnosis \u2014 a clear acknowledgment of the enemy \u2014 are inherently unsatisfying. Doctors, through their training and mandate, are motivated to package a constellation of symptoms into something that can be understood, named and treated.\n\nAt the same time, we have both a growing arsenal of medications to fix patients\u2019 problems and a steadily shrinking number of minutes in which to do so. Not surprisingly, the path of least resistance becomes labeling and prescribing instead of exploring and managing.\n\nPatients are motivated by the understandable desire to name and ease their suffering \u2014 and today, many more patients have that opportunity. But it also means that much of normal human experience is treated with prescriptions instead of patience. This is perhaps not surprising. We increasingly have easy solutions at our fingertips: Dial-up modems have given way to broadband; stores are being replaced by Amazon drones; courtship is now Tinder. Is it wrong for patients to expect quick fixes from medicine?\n\nAn important step forward may be putting more emphasis on nonprescription remedies. For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don\u2019t come with side effects)."}]
