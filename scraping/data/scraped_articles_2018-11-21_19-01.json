The oil crash -- crude is down almost 30% from its recent peak -- was triggered by a series of factors that combined to spook traders who once saw $100 oil on the horizon.\n\n\"The sheer scale of the move is triggering unpleasant memories of 2014 and 2015,\" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets, alluding to the last oil downturn.\n\nUS oil prices bounced 2% on Wednesday after tumbling to 13-month lows the day before.\n\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the oil crash.\n\n\"Oil prices getting lower, Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy!\" Trump tweeted. \"Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!\"\n\nBut the oil slide can't be explained by a simple tweet.\n\nIran headfake\n\nSaudi Arabia deserves some of the \"credit\" -- but certainly not all of it.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration vowed to zero out Iranian oil exports. That tough stance on Iran sanctions lifted prices dramatically.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump, Saudi Arabia ramped up production to an all-time high. That's critical because Saudi Arabia is like the central bank of oil. It's the world's largest exporter and the only country with the ability to significantly ramp up output. Russia and the United States also accelerated production.\n\nBut the Trump administration shocked the oil market earlier this month by taking a softer approach on Iran. Temporary waivers were granted , allowing India, China and other countries to keep buying crude from Iran.\n\nThe Iran headfake left the oil market suddenly facing a potential supply glut. OPEC is now under pressure to significantly cut output at next month's meeting in Vienna to help put a floor beneath the market.\n\nWorkers extracting oil from the Permian Basin, the West Texas shale hotbed that has morphed into one of the world's most important oilfields.\n\nAmerican shale oil boom\n\nAlthough Trump praised Saudi Arabia, his tweet omitted the central role played by America in the oil plunge. Lifted by the shale oil boom, the United States recently overtook Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's largest oil producer for the first time since 1973.\n\nThe International Energy Agency predicts US output will have soared by more than 2 million barrels per day in 2018. It's expected to climb further next year. No other country has ramped up production to that degree.\n\nThe fear among oil traders is that the world may not need all that American shale coming to market. That's what helped cause the last oil crash. US inventory levels have increased nine straight weeks, according to numbers released on Wednesday.\n\nDemand fears\n\nBut this oil downturn isn't solely about excess supply. The slowdown in global economic growth appears to already be denting demand.\n\nAppetite for oil in the United States has been \"very robust,\" but the IEA warned last week of \"relatively weak\" demand in Europe and developed Asian countries. And the IEA flagged a \"slowdown\" in demand in India, Brazil and Argentina caused by high prices, weak currencies and deteriorating economic activity\n\nLast month the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 GDP estimates for both China and the United States because of the trade war. Global GDP is expected to slow from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.5% next year. That's never good news for oil, which powers the economy.\n\nStock market mayhem\n\nThe oil collapse in part reflects the \"broader cross-commodity and cross-asset sell-off as growth concerns continue to mount,\" Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, wrote to clients on Tuesday.\n\nCourvalin argued that the oil selloff has \"overshot\" the fundamentals. However, he predicted oil won't recover until OPEC takes action and there's evidence that demand growth is \"resilient.\"\n\nFast money\n\nCommodities, much like stocks, are influenced by large bets made by hedge funds and other traders. Analysts say the oil plunge was exacerbated by the unwinding of massive bullish bets by financial players.\n\nThe managed money community's long positions in crude plunged in late October to the lowest level since early 2016 when crude crashed to $26 a barrel, according to RBC.\n\nOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nGasoline keeps getting cheaper\n\nThe pre-Thanksgiving Day oil crash will make traveling cheaper for millions of Americans. The national average price of gasoline dropped to $2.60 a gallon on Wednesday, down from $2.85 a month ago, according to AAA.\n\nThat could provide an extra boost to the economy heading into the holiday shopping season . Trump likened the decline in oil prices to a \"big Tax Cut\" for America.\n\n\"Retail gasoline prices have come off significantly. What more does Trump want?\" said RBC's Tran. \"At some point you start to hurt your own domestic producers. And a significant portion of the oil and gas industry is his base support.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Here's where the biggest travel headaches are", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/-k8LMCGjitg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Romaine lettuce is seen on sale at a supermarket in Washington, DC on Monday.

The Times also reported that Facebook had hired a public relations firm that dug up dirt on its competitors.\n\nZuckerberg was more pointed when addressing the Times report specifically. \"It is not clear to me at all that the report is right,\" he said. \"A lot of the things that were in that report, we talked to the reporters ahead of time and told them that from everything that we'd seen, that wasn't true and they chose to print it anyway.\"\n\nIn one exchange, Zuckerberg addressed an assertion in the Times story about why Facebook's executives decided not to remove a particularly controversial 2015 post from then presidential candidate Donald Trump about Muslim immigration.\n\nWhen asked if the decision was motivated by a desire to appease political leaders, Zuckerberg flatly said no. \"I think it's very important that people have the opportunity to hear from what political leaders are saying,\" he said. Facebook's content policies give \"special deference\" to newsworthy content, he said. \"I think we did the right thing there.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Times previously defended the article in a statement after Facebook disputed the report: \"Our story is accurate and we stand by it. The monthslong investigation by a team of reporters was based on interviews with more than 50 sources including current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members.\"\n\nZuckerberg has reportedly been even more blunt in his assessment inside the company. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Zuckerberg told employees that recent coverage of Facebook is \"bullshit.\"\n\nEven before the Times investigation, Zuckerberg and Facebook struggled to move past a series of crises, including Russian election meddling, the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , and a massive security breach impacting tens of millions of users.\n\nFacebook stock has plummeted 40% from its all-time high in July as investors worry about the long-term privacy backlash and the company's warnings that its ad sales machine could slow as it \" puts privacy first .\"\n\nYet, Zuckerberg implied that little is likely to change at the very top of the company anytime soon. When asked if he would consider stepping down as Facebook's chairman, Zuckerberg said, \"that's not the plan.\" He also threw his support behind his No. 2, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, despite criticism of her role in handling Facebook's recent crises.\n\n\"Sheryl is a really important part of this company and is leading a lot of the efforts for a lot of the biggest issues that we have,\" Zuckerberg told CNN Business. \"She's been an important partner to me for ten years.

When those investigations validate any misconduct, TSA takes swift disciplinary actions,\" said Kelly, who added, \"we are proud of the highly skilled and trained Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) who keep our skies safe every day.\"\n\nThe documents from TSA's Office of Inspection, which audits and inspects TSA operations, do not stipulate whether the allegations of misconduct were substantiated, or whether the air marshals involved were disciplined. The records also did not identify the employees by name.\n\nTSA has investigated 35 incidents in which air marshals were alleged to have unintentionally or inappropriately discharged or brandished weapons between 2007 and 2017. Of those, 27 incidents were substantiated and resulted in disciplinary action, while eight were cleared with no action taken.\n\nTSA did not share the number and outcome of investigations of other types of alleged misconduct involving firearms described in the documents.\n\nHow the cases compare to rates of misconduct with firearms within other law enforcement agencies is unclear because the total number of air marshals is classified. However, former air marshals say any mishap with a firearm is unacceptable because of the unique sensitivity of aviation security.\n\n\"When you're in an airport around thousands of people or in an airplane that's essentially a small tube 30,000 feet in the air, you have to be incredibly accurate. You can't make mistakes,\" said Henry Preston, a former air marshal and training instructor who retired in 2014.\n\nPreston and four other former air marshals reached by CNN said they observed inconsistencies in \"recurrent training\" during their time with the Federal Air Marshal Service, such as disagreements among instructors on how to enforce marksmanship and safety standards.\n\nAir marshals are required to undergo recurrent training that includes quarterly marksmanship evaluations and annual off-range safety courses, but a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found the air marshal service did not have complete and timely data on the extent to which its officers completed that training. Kelly, the air marshal spokesman, said TSA has implemented the GAO's recommendations on how to better evaluate air marshal training.\n\nThree of the cases in the documents obtained by CNN related to misconduct during firearms training.\n\nIn 2013, for example, an air marshal instructor \"committed egregious safety violations\" by allegedly throwing a handful of expired simulation ammunition into an open fire during a training exercise, according to the records. The ammunition exploded and flying debris hit one staff member in the face, the documents state.\n\nDaniel Kowal, a current supervisory air marshal and section chief at the agency's training facility near Atlantic City, New Jersey, said that while any case of misconduct is embarrassing, the Federal Air Marshal Service prides itself on rigorous firearms training and strives for zero errors.\n\n\"When we hear incidents like this, we immediately convene a panel to address them and we look at what was the underlying cause, what happened, if and when the training failed, how and why did it fail, and how do we plug that gap,\" Kowal said.\n\nIn addition to recurrent training, all air marshals must first go through a 16-week training course that starts with basic law enforcement techniques, taught in New Mexico, and ends with more advanced weapons-handling and other skills taught at the Atlantic City facility, where CNN observed training in action.\n\nKowal said air marshals must achieve a minimum marksmanship score of 255 out of 300, which he described as the highest firearms qualification standard in federal law enforcement, and he said air marshals have an average individual score of about 283.\n\nBrian Borek, who represents air marshals as agency president at the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, told CNN some field offices do an excellent job with recurrent training, while disparities exist at others because of limitations on size, resources and personnel. He said that doesn't make them less effective, \"just different and limited.\"\n\n\"These challenges are not unique to FAMS agency, however. This exists at all large-scale organizations. This in no way translates to the readiness or skill set of air marshals. They are the best in the world,\" Borek said.\n\nThe incidents of misconduct with firearms adds to a history of controversies that have plagued the Federal Air Marshal Service. Several former air marshals reached by CNN said that in addition to inconsistencies in recurrent training, grueling hours, low morale and even alcoholism affect the mission-readiness of many air marshals.\n\n\"There are systemic problems within the culture that affect the men and women doing the job,\" said Clay Biles, a former air marshal who wrote a book about the agency, titled \"Unsecure Skies.\"\n\nIn 2012, a commissioned study conducted by the Division of Sleep Medicine of Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School found that 75% of air marshals flying domestic missions were sleep-deficient. The study stated air marshals suffering from fatigue have increased risk of \"self-injury\" and \"greater incidence of serious errors.\"\n\nIn 2015, CNN reported that 10 federal air marshals had killed themselves since 2002, and representatives of the Air Marshal Association said job stress contributed to those deaths. At least two of the cases in the TSA Office of Inspection documents obtained by CNN involved alleged suicides by air marshals.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April that the TSA has had to monitor whether air marshals show up for their flights sober. The TSA said its Office of Inspection makes quality assurance visits to ensure mission readiness.\n\nSome government reports have indicated money spent on some air marshal programs would be more effective in funding other forms of aviation security. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that the air marshal service's \"contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable.\"\n\nA document obtained by CNN in August showed a TSA proposal to reduce the federal air marshal program that would save the agency nearly $39 million per year.\n\nJohn Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University who has assessed the efficiencies of various forms of aviation security, argues that the costs of air marshals outweigh their benefits. He recommends training and arming more pilots to resist hijackers and adding secondary cockpit barriers.\n\nReferring to air marshals, Mueller said, \"They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them. There are much less expensive security measures, which could replace them and save lots of money.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "What do you take when you only have minutes to flee a wildfire?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/wLoWgExTZ2I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "And time is running out.\n\nThe wildfires raging through California have already claimed 80 lives just this month.

They never got an official alert to evacuate, but they had 15 minutes to grab what they could.\n\nShe managed to rescue her cat, Twila. The family's other cat, an orange tabby named Ember, is still missing.\n\nThe high school student is grateful she escaped safely to Chico, but there was one thing she wished she had taken.\n\n\"I wish I grabbed my guitar,\" Smalley said. \"I would play it every day, so I was sad when I didn't have that anymore. I did however grab my camera, my computer, and a box full of my Polaroid pictures.\"\n\nPhotography holds a special place in Smalley's heart, especially during a time when she and her community have lost almost everything.

They had moved to Paradise seven months ago and were still unpacking.\n\n\"One thing we learned is having all our important documents and photos on hard drives. They happened to be all in one location,\" Clunies-Ross told CNN. \"That's what saved that stuff.\"\n\nSome of the family's clothes and their toiletries were already packed, left from a trip to Oregon the week before. Having some essentials ready gave Clunies-Ross the time to pack her medications.\n\nWhen she got to her closet, she started at her clothes. She didn't know what to take or how to pack them. She left them hanging there.\n\n\"I think in crisis you don't have the brain power to make any sense of anything. Even if there was a list you had, I don't think it would make sense of the time,\" she said.\n\nClunies-Ross is a nurse midwife and an emergency provider, yet she lost her calm while in a 15-minute frenzy to grab whatever she could. \"I couldn't save my life if I had to. I was just on the verge of losing it,\" she said.\n\nShe had sent her husband and two children on their way in the other car, as she was on call at the hospital, she said. She still hadn't received an alert to evacuate.\n\nThe 39-year-old made several trips to her car and noticed the fire was spreading quickly. A fire had appeared in her front lawn and the next time she looked, a man came out of nowhere and put it out for her.\n\nA few framed photos, her daughter's stuffed bunny and some of her husband's favorite vintage T-shirts also made it out.\n\nTheir home, made of cedar, didn't make it. \"It looks like a house was never there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad I have my family,\" she said. \"At the same time, nothing else really matters in the mix of it all. Money can buy any of those things.\"\n\nPrized journals, family pets and two favorite books\n\nKim Stanwood Terranova was at her Malibu home and business when the first wildfire alerts started coming in late at night.\n\nLiving there for more than 25 years, she's had experience with wildfires and wanted to wait for more updates on where the Woolsey Fire was heading. Her friend from the Red Cross told her she should start getting ready to go. Nervous, her 20-year-old daughter pleaded for them to pack.\n\nShe gathered her passport and important documents and told her daughter they'd pack up a few things and assess the situation in the morning.\n\nIn the middle of the night, more alerts came -- the fire was coming at the 10-acre property from two directions, she said.\n\nStanwood Terranova's house was more than a home -- it was also her business and a retreat center she called a \"sacred place.\" She's a licensed spiritual counselor.\n\nShe sent her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend on their way and spent one hour going through the house and property. She opened the property's gates so firefighters could enter, packed items and she blessed each room of the house.\n\nStanwood Terranova stood in front of her library, asking herself what she couldn't live without. She took her two favorite books that she teaches from, each one filled with notes in the margins. Right above those, she reached for the many journals she's kept over the past 20 to 30 years, as well as the ones she wrote for her two children.\n\nShe took her computers, the start of the book she's been writing and all her business contacts.\n\nShe forgot to take any clothes with her, having to purchase some after she evacuated. She left a \"beautiful necklace sitting on the counter,\" but said she didn't care.\n\nHer two bull mastiffs, Brando and Juliet, were the first thing she loaded in the car and then came whatever else there was room for. Otherwise there wasn't much. \"I truly thought I was coming home,\" she said.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m., she evacuated for Ojai.\n\nShe later found out her home and business were destroyed by the fire. Her godson took a photo of it when he saw her property on TV.\n\n\"I feel more blessed that I know what happened to my house,\" she said. \"I'm nervous to pull up and deal with that level of emotions but at least I know.\"\n\nA change of clothes, medications and a guitar\n\nTwo shirts, a pair of pants, a pair of shorts and the shoes on his feet are what Phil Bartek grabbed in the short time he had to leave.\n\nBartek never received an alert to evacuate Paradise. He only had 15 minutes to leave.\n\nA caddy holding his medications and his guitar also came with him. He managed to find and save his cat, Kobe, before heading out.\n\nThe 63-year-old grabbed what he could, but he knew he had another stop to make: his granddaughter's school. He managed to save her family's dog, LC, from their home after that.\n\nBartek wishes he would have remembered to grab his wedding rings. The retiree is engaged and the wedding is set for February. The homemade wedding decorations were lost in the fire, as was his entire house.\n\nBartek described the scene outside as he evacuated as \"Armageddon.

Committee chairs can drag executives in front of public hearings and compel testimony about all manner of the private company's dealings. They can also inundate it with document requests.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, executives reminded staff to preserve records, according to a person familiar with the conversations. They also discussed bringing on additional outside counsel, that person said, particularly a firm with expertise in government investigations. Though it's unclear how serious they are about that option\u2014 two other people familiar with Trump's legal team say they are not aware of an effort to hire more lawyers\u2014 doing so would be a big shift for the president's family-owned business, which tends to rely on a tight group of longtime loyal executives and attorneys.\n\nTwo of the company's lawyers tell CNN they're comfortable with their current team, which they say is well-prepared and battle-tested given the number of lawsuits the company has faced over the years. There is also a sense, wishful thinking perhaps, that Democratic investigations may not be as politically damaging as some close to the president fear.\n\nLawyers close to the President and his company suggest Democrats may temper their inquiries once they formally take over next year amid pressure to balance the potential political fallout of looking like they're out to get the Trump Organization against other investigative priorities, such as government spending by cabinet members. Some of those same lawyers say they anticipate Congress will strike a softer tone in order to advance other Democratic priorities such as protecting healthcare and passing an infrastructure package.\n\nOpen investigations\n\nWhatever happens, the Democratic takeover of the House is still more than a month away. Until then, the Trump Organization will continue to deal with two open investigations and the threat of a third. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is investigating allegations of tax fraud, CNN has reported , while the Manhattan US attorney's office is examining whether executives violated campaign-finance laws in their effort to help facilitate hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump. That probe is the subject of an \"ongoing\" grand jury investigation , according to court filings and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office is currently pursuing a civil law suit against the President's charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, as well as against the President himself and his adult children. The office is also weighing whether it could pursue a criminal probe of the charity, an effort that could touch on the Trump Organization, given how closely the nonprofit and company are intertwined. Tish James, the state's newly-elected attorney general, ran for the seat by promising voters an aggressive pursuit of the President.\n\nThe Trump Organization also has the problem of Michael Cohen, the company's former vice president and Trump's longtime lawyer, who pleaded guilty in August to eight counts brought by the Manhattan US Attorney's office. Cohen has been speaking with federal investigators and is set to be sentenced on December 12. Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, received limited immunity for his cooperation in prosecutors' investigation of Cohen. Weisselberg's cooperation is limited to the Cohen investigation.\n\nWeisselberg, along with the company's longtime general counsel, Alan Garten, are among 30 people connected to the President and his business dealings that California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff would like to interview. Schiff, the likely incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has indicated that he will make investigating possible Russian money laundering a top priority. That includes potential money laundering through the Trump Organization, as well as foreign payments made to former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both of whom pleaded guilty to financial crimes in the special counsel's investigation.\n\nIf and when Democrats do launch new probes into the President's business, the Trump Organization plans to highlight previous cooperation with congressional committees as evidence of the good faith efforts it has made in the past, said the person familiar with its plans. The firm has turned over documents to various congressional committees for the last two years, providing documents to lawmakers probing Russian election meddling and answering requests for information about possible violations of the anti-corruption clauses in the constitution, known as emoluments clauses.\n\nExisting subpoenas\n\nWhen it comes to questions about ethics matters, including emoluments, the Trump Organization has responded to about 85 percent of the requests, the person said. Democratic staffers disagree with the characterization, pointing out that many of the responses didn't actually provide enough or even any information.\n\nIn a 2017 response to Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings' request for information on how the firm tracks foreign government payments, the company provided an outline of a system it had designed to monitor foreign government revenue and how to calculate profits from it. The lawmaker belittled the Trump Organization's plan, calling it a \"pamphlet\" that \"raised grave concerns.\"\n\nDemocrats have said that the hundreds of letters they've sent over the past two years \u2014 requesting documents themselves or pleading with Republicans to investigate various issues \u2014 provide an investigative roadmap for when they take the majority, and the Trump Organization has been a frequent target across multiple committees.\n\nDemocrats are still deciding which of those investigations they want to prioritize. Democratic aides say there's no master list yet of how investigations will be launched in the new Congress, but the sheer number of committees that want to probe the Trump Organization \u2014 there are at least five\u2014 signals that the company will be a top priority, particularly when it comes to issues such as foreign payments made to Trump, allegations of Russian money laundering, and gaining access to Trump's personal tax returns.\n\n\"I've always believed that the key here is follow the money,\" said Rep. Denny Heck of Washington, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"That would be my strongest desire: that we do something to get at some of the questions that were raised about whether or not the Russians had undue influence over President Trump because of some preexisting financial entanglements.\"\n\nTrump's relationship with Deutsche Bank, which was fined in a Russian money laundering scheme, is one topic multiple committees have said they want to examine, given the bank's history of lending to Trump-related businesses and projects. California Rep. Maxine Waters, who is expected to chair the House Financial Services Committee, has pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, and sent letters requesting information about its Russian operations and whether accounts Trump and his family members held had any ties to Russia.\n\nA spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the change in leadership and referred CNN to a previous statement, which said, \"Deutsche Bank takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.\"\n\nLooking for lawyers\n\nThe President's company is facing a situation not all that dissimilar from the President himself. With special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian election interference entering its final phase, and House Democrats preparing to unleash a barrage of investigations, the White House is seeking to hire as many as two dozen attorneys to fill out its counsel's office, whose ranks have been depleted in past months as staff attorneys have left.\n\nBut there's a difference between hiring lawyers for the White House and for the President's company. Taxpayers foot the bill for those White House attorneys, while the money to defend his company comes from the Trump family. Over the years, the company has been loath to spend big money on lots of expensive attorneys, deciding instead to rely on a small group of loyal people to handle the its legal issues.\n\nThe company's primary outside lawyer is Alan Futerfas, a New York-based criminal defense lawyer who represents not only the Trump Organization, but also the President's eldest sons, Donald Jr and Eric, who now head the company. Futerfas' firm of only three principal attorneys has been the front-line response team to multiple investigations by Mueller's office, Manhattan federal prosecutors and several congressional committees.\n\nFuterfas works closely with Garten, the company's general counsel. While Futerfas has handled the bulk of the inquiries for both the company and the sons, at some point the interests of those clients could diverge, opening up the need for another set of lawyers to represent just the company. Futerfas and Garten did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did The Trump Organization.\n\nThe lines separating the interests of Trump and those of his company were indistinguishable prior to his arrival at the White House. When he took office in January 2017, he put his assets in a trust and handed over day-to-day management of his business to Donald Jr and Eric. Over the years Trump has turned to a reliable set of outside law firms to represent both him and his company. That includes the firm Morgan Lewis, which has advised Trump on tax issues, as well as two lawyers in particular, Marc Kasowitz and Larry Rosen.\n\nKasowitz, a longtime attorney for Trump, continues to be involved in a variety of matters for the President, most notably defending him in the ongoing defamation lawsuit brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on \"The Apprentice.\" Kasowitz was an early member of the President's legal team handling matters arising from the Mueller investigation but in July 2017 he stepped aside and made way for John Dowd, who left in May 2018.\n\nRosen has represented Trump since the early 1990s, most recently handling campaign-related matters and a defamation lawsuit filed against the President by GOP strategist Cheryl Jacobus. He also represented Cohen in an arbitration dispute concerning payments made to Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump. The White House has denied her allegations.\n\nEarlier this year, following a shakeup of the President's private defense team, a few large law firms passed on the opportunity to defend him in the Mueller investigation. If the Trump Organization does decide it needs to hire more lawyers, it may face similar issues given the impression among some lawyers that the President and his company don't pay their legal fees. At least three defense attorneys based in New York and D.C. raised that as a concern to CNN-- though none had been approached by the company about representing it. One lawyer said his firm has a policy of not working with the company. Firms have also turned it down because their other clients have balked at the notion of being associated with the President, his family or his company.\n\nUltimately, the extent of the scrutiny that is brought on the company will become clear as Democrats take control of the House in January."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Analysis: This is a stress test of the US government", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/s4DuGOuuiTs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "\"Lock her up!\" and \"America First!\" are more than just slogans. He's stress-testing the government for ways to punish his rival Hillary Clinton and absolving Saudi Arabia for the way its titular leader dispatched with one of his critics in exchange for their participation in the US arms market.\n\nFreedom to dissent and the peaceful transfer of power between opponents are supposed to be what sets the US apart from undemocratic societies.\n\nBut when Trump shot back at Clinton during a 2016 presidential debate that if he were President she'd be in jail , it was a prelude to him actually targeting his former rival and pressuring the Department of Justice to actually \"lock her up.\"\n\nHe's tweeted as much since then, complaining that the DOJ wasn't doing enough to investigate her.\n\nBut his view on political rivals like Clinton and critics like former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired, is that the government -- HIS government, he believes -- should be mobilized against them.\n\nHis former White House counsel Don McGahn stood in the way, according to The New York Times . But he's also asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, then Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff who has since become acting attorney general, for updates on the investigation.\n\n\"We live in a democracy and you don't go after your political rivals,\" said Alberto Gonzales, who served as both White House counsel and attorney general for Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nBut Gonzales added during an interview with CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" Wednesday that so far, the people around Trump have kept his power dreams in check. The process, he argued, has worked.\n\n\"Sometimes I think this President in particular says things out of frustration but nothing comes of it, and so long as we have good people serving in these senior positions, both in the White House and in the Department of Justice, I have to be confident the rule of law is going to be respected,\" Gonzales said.\n\nThis is the place to point out that that particular counsel is gone and hasn't been replaced. Trump is also in the market for a new attorney general. The man stepping in temporarily is Whitaker, who has been publicly critical of the special counsel investigation that Trump calls a witch hunt. Nowhere has Trump's personal frustrations with the government around him and his desire to influence the Justice Department been more evident than on that government's ability to investigate possible collusion with Russia by his campaign.\n\nWhile his political grudges have influenced his interactions with justice officials, Trump has ignored the politically inconvenient determinations of his intelligence community.\n\nOne of Trump's main slogans since becoming President is \"America First!\" and that was the subhead of his stream-of-conscious-dictated statement meant to silence debate about how or whether the US should react to Saudi Arabia's official involvement in the death and dismemberment of Virginia resident and Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"Maybe they did or maybe they didn't,\" Trump said in the release, again contradicting his intelligence community. That line seems to be code for the fact that he doesn't care what Saudi Arabia does to its dissidents at long as the government there is buying US-made weapons.\n\nThe din in Trump's ear on Saudi Arabia, which the US has long backed as an ally in the Middle East, had grown as evidence grew in the eyes of US intelligence agencies that the operation against Khashoggi had the imprimatur of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nTrump, after inking a deal for Saudi Arabia to buy more US weapons doesn't want to hear that, so he affixed eight exclamation points in his statement to drive the point home.\n\nHe's also grown tired of the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election -- the one that gave him his current job -- so he's routinely tried to distract from the inquiry into whether his campaign was complicit in that interference by returning again and again to Clinton, the rival he vanquished and the person Russia tried to keep from winning.\n\nThe difference between Saudi Arabia -- a kingdom -- and the United States -- a representative democracy with checks and balances -- is that in Saudi Arabia, a prince can dispatch a team of agents to deal with an inconvenient public critic in a foreign land. They can arrest scads of political rivals and lock them up in the Ritz Carlton during a power grab\n\nTrump, despite his desires, is hemmed in by the system he leads, which puts us a long way from that kind of naked abuse of power in the US, where the institutions of government do not as easily allow for that moral flexibility.\n\nHis absolution of Saudi Arabia of any consequences for the killing of Khashoggi drew reactions from Republicans like Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul, as well as Sen.-elect Mitt Romney.\n\n\"America can't excuse & minimize the brutal & gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident & columnist. Our country is defined by human values, by principle above convenience, & by commitment to morality. We must subject the perpetrators of this outrage to withering sanction,\" Romney tweeted after the release of Trump's statement.\n\nNot that such admonitions are likely to influence Trump's thinking. They don't even signal new Republican opposition to the President after the party suffered losses at the ballot box that cost them control of the House and gave Democrats a new foothold in Washington.\n\nTrump has said he sees the election as a victory because Republicans picked up two seats in the Senate. And Republican control of that chamber means he is likely safe, for now, from serious censure or biting legislative counteractions.\n\nIt has long been a far different thing for Republicans to criticize Trump as opposed to voting against his policies, which means Trump will likely maintain a protective buffer in the Senate from anything the newly powerful House Democratic majority does to contain him.\n\nThe progression of Trump policy from tweet to slogan to action has become more familiar, even though his ideas and tweets seem designed for shock value.\n\nThe lasting legacy of the Trump administration will be very dependent on how the government -- whether in the form of the courts, the Congress, the special counsel or the bureaucracy and staff around him -- can contain his attempts to use the government as his own political tool.\n\nThe tension between powers is what keeps the US government in balance, but as he does with everything, Trump has supercharged the stress."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Analysis: Top Trump officials saved the President from himself", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/pyVrfCWQQck/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Had President Donald Trump been successful in launching prosecutions against Hillary Clinton and James Comey, it could have spelled the end of his presidency, as a clear-cut abuse of power.\n\nIt never happened, apparently thwarted by then-White House Counsel Don McGahn and other senior officials.

Quite the reverse.\n\nAt the very least, the latest developments underline how Trump's senior subordinates may have shielded a President unschooled in constitutional norms from disastrous steps that could have put his presidency in peril.\n\nAnd it leaves anyone on the outside wondering what other potential disasters top officials like McGahn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein might have prevented.\n\nThey also raise questions about the capacity of a now-understaffed White House and legal counsel's operation to protect the President from current or future transgressions.\n\nIt will be impossible to confirm, given the habitual silence from the special counsel's office, but the revelations hint at the possibility that Robert Mueller knows much more about what went on in the corridors of the West Wing than has been publicly revealed.\n\nThat will play into rising tensions in Washington amid expectations that the endgame of Mueller's probe is in sight and speculation about possible indictments targeting Trump world and the content of his final report.\n\nBombshell reports by CNN and The New York Times about the President's intentions emerged on another surreal day in Washington that saw shocking disclosures about Ivanka Trump's emails and a huge foreign policy pivot over Saudi Arabia\n\nThey will bolster perceptions that Trump views the Justice Department as an instrument of his personal power rather than an insulated government department responsible for the neutral administration of justice.\n\nTrump had forecast his intentions\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that the President, on multiple occasions, asked Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then chief of staff to the attorney general, how they were doing in investigating Clinton.\n\nEarlier, The New York Times reported that Trump had asked McGahn to get the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and fired FBI Director Comey but that he had been rebuffed.\n\nThe paper, lifting the lid on extreme pressure faced by top law enforcement officials in the US government, also said Trump had repeatedly criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray for failing to more aggressively investigate Clinton, calling him weak.\n\nIt is not surprising that Trump would call for such prosecutions. He has frequently said as much on the campaign trail and on Twitter and beamed as his crowds chanted \"lock her up,\" referring to his 2016 election foe.\n\nBut that he would actually believe he has the power to follow through on his demands and such action would be politically acceptable is the most alarming takeaway from the reports.\n\nA prosecution of Clinton -- possibly over her private email server or an Obama-era uranium deal struck with Russia, both while she was secretary of state -- would have challenged the fundamentals of the political system itself. American democracy since George Washington, the first president, has been assured by the peaceful transfer of power between often bitter rivals. In a saga that became embroiled in the 2016 election, the FBI investigated Clinton's email use, but declined to recommend charges.\n\nMobilizing the government's prosecutorial powers against Comey would represent a vindictive swipe against a political enemy, a worrying sign in itself.\n\nBut it could also have led Trump onto perilous legal ground because he fired Comey and then told NBC News he had done so because of the Russia investigation -- which Comey was then leading -- raising concerns that the President had obstructed justice.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far Replay More Videos ...

Using the federal government to target such a witness would risk playing into the obstruction of justice case that Mueller is investigating, since it could offer evidence for the question of whether the President had acted with malicious intent.\n\nJosh Campbell, who served as an aide to Comey at the FBI and is now a CNN analyst, said his former boss was shaking his head at reports that the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him.\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said on \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\nComey wrote in his book \"A Higher Loyalty,\" which came out earlier this year, that Trump often reminded him of a mafia boss and sent him back to his days prosecuting the mob, especially with the President's demands for personal loyalty.\n\nRenewed scrutiny of Matt Whitaker\n\nThe latest revelations also cast new scrutiny on Whitaker, who is now acting attorney general, after Trump fired Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's elevation, and past criticism of the Mueller probe, sparked concerns that he was put in place to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nA source told CNN's Pamela Brown that Whitaker, in his former role, came to meetings with Trump prepared to answer how the Justice Department was pursuing investigations against the Clinton Foundation and on the Uranium One issue, over a mining company whose sale to Russia's atomic energy agency had been approved by the Obama administration while Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe source said Whitaker tried to appease the President and there was no sign that he had crossed a line.\n\nWhitaker is now in a role in which he oversees the Mueller probe, and thus could face intense pressure from a President who has made no secret of his disdain for an investigation he has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhen Trump first requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, the Times said. The paper also reported that McGahn had gone so far as to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a request.\n\nIn many ways, the latest reports underline how Trump, a neophyte in Washington when he was inaugurated in January 2017, does not appreciate or respect normal boundaries between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nThey also suggest how if he is not constrained, the President could accidentally stumble into a position that contravenes the Constitution and puts his presidency in jeopardy.\n\nThat possibility seems to be exacerbated by Trump's increasing self-confidence in a White House that may be about to be deprived of many remaining restraining influences in a government reshuffle.\n\nTuesday's reports recalled an exchange in a Clinton/Trump presidential debate in 2016, when the Democratic nominee remarked that it was good that someone with her rival's temperament wasn't running the country.\n\n\"Because you would be in jail,\" Trump replied."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump raised investigating Clinton with Rosenstein, Whitaker and McGahn", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/EfHczYKL9uI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on multiple occasions raised with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then-chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, whether the Justice Department was progressing in investigating Hillary Clinton, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe President also wanted his previous White House counsel, Don McGahn, to ask the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton on numerous occasions, but McGahn rebuffed doing that, the source said.\n\nAnticipating the question about Clinton would be raised, Whitaker came prepared to answer with what Justice was doing on Clinton-related matters, including the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One investigations, the source said.

The FBI and federal prosecutors are looking into whether donors to the foundation were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state in exchange for donations to the charity's coffers, as well as whether tax-exempt funds were misused, the official said. A spokesman for Clinton dismissed the allegations as unfounded.\n\nWilliam Burck, a lawyer for McGahn, issued a statement following the Times report that said the President hadn't ordered prosecutions of Clinton or Comey.\n\n\"Mr. McGahn will not comment on his legal advice to the president.

Democrats have decried Whitaker's appointment in part because of his previous comments criticizing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which he now supervises.\n\nTrump said during his campaign that he would seek to use the presidency to direct an investigation against Clinton, and since taking office he has repeatedly railed against the Justice Department for the special counsel investigation's focus on his associates rather than investigations into his political opponents.\n\nTrump engaged in a war of words with Sessions several months before the Alabama Republican was fired, and the President said on Twitter that Sessions should investigate Democrats and \"Comey lies.\"\n\nCNN reported prior to McGahn's official exit that Trump was unnerved about the extent of McGahn's personal cooperation with Mueller's investigation -- cooperation that included some 30 hours of interviews with Mueller's team.\n\nBut McGahn's time in the White House also saw him in a central role shaping the federal judiciary and helping to shepherd Trump's picks for the Supreme Court through the Senate.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Chief Justice Roberts defends judiciary in rare statement after Trump criticism", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/tedeeUZMDD0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts made a rare statement on Wednesday pushing back against President Donald Trump after the President again went after federal judges.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.

So It's likely associated with end of season harvest in California,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different this year is that the FDA has higher confidence that it's romaine lettuce in both countries. \"This year, we're a month earlier, so we're earlier in the process, earlier in the throes of an outbreak,\" Gottlieb said. \"So we're able to actually get real-time information and conduct effective trace back and isolate what the source is.\"\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness.\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, according to the US Food and Drug Administration , which is also investigating the outbreak. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\n\"That's why we think it's critical to get this information out,\" Gottlieb said. \"We understand fully the impact this has, not just on the growers and the distributors but also on consumers -- consumers who are preparing meals for the holidays, who have product now that they're going to need to discard, maybe food that they've already cooked.\"\n\nHow does the US prevent foodborne illness?\n\nFoodborne illness hits one in six Americans every year, the CDC says, estimating that 48 million people get sick due to one or another of 31 pathogens. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die annually.\n\nPreventing foodborne illness in the United States is the job of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which oversees the meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and the FDA, responsible for domestic and imported foods.\n\nWith frequent news of outbreaks, which are investigated by the CDC, many people might wonder whether foodborne illness is on the rise -- and whether safety measures across the nation adequately protect our food supply.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the CDC has investigated 21 multistate foodborne illness outbreaks this year, more than any year in the past decade.\n\n\"I think that the issue isn't that there's more unsafe food,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think what's happening is that we have better technology than ever before to link outbreaks of human illness to a common pathogen.\"\n\nIn all 50 states, the CDC has the capacity to do genomic testing on samples from infected patients (such as blood samples).

The CDC announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported, though 21 people have been hospitalized, the public health agency reports. The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA.

But the night before Turkey Day, informally known as \"Friendsgiving\" and \"Drinksgiving,\" may, anecdotally speaking, see more pub patrons.\n\nWith nearly everyone taking off the next day, Thanksgiving Eve is basically Friday night times three. Friends arriving from distant places will converge on the local watering hole, while local singles throng the same bar in the hopes of meeting someone before the holidays officially lift off. Hello, stranger!\n\nYour unofficial high school reunion or pre-turkey rager isn't necessarily something to be embarrassed about.\n\nNothing in print (or on screen) is likely to stop you from texting friends to arrange a pre-Turkey hang session, so take pleasure in the fact that your natural social instinct is a healthy one.\n\nBe grateful for friendships\n\nRecent research has repeatedly shown that strong friendships and social ties extend our lives , generally keep us healthier and keep our brains active and synapses firing.\n\n\"People who are more socially connected live longer than people who are less socially connected,\" said Julianne Holt-Lunstad , a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University. Whether your social network is measured in terms of the size or the extent to which you feel supported by it, people who have a wealth of friends live longer than those more socially impoverished, she adds.\n\nThis is more or less the consensus within the social sciences.\n\n\"Social relationships can vastly promote health -- and the lack thereof would be vastly detrimental to health,\" said Yang Claire Yang , a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"It's tremendous.\"\n\nYang adds that the positive impact of social relationships can be assessed by \"objectively measured\" physiological markers across our cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems. In fact, the amount our social relationships influence our mortality and health are comparable to -- if not exceeding, Yang says -- well-known factors such as physical activity and smoking.\n\nThe ways social connectedness influences health are practical and even logical, Holt-Lunstad explains.\n\n\"It's not just this weird correlation,\" she said. \"Just the extent you have others around and can provide assistance and resources and a sense of companionship. ... Even basic things like if you were to fall or have a medical emergency can make a huge difference in your outcome.\"\n\nAnother example: If all your friends are vegetarians who do yoga, this \"social norm\" will probably influence you to exercise and eat right, says Holt-Lunstad. Relationships also help you manage stress. Friends help buffer us from the world and help us \"talk out\" our problems. In other cases, our social links to, say, a religious group can provide much-needed aid or financial assistance in times of need.\n\nThat said, Holt-Lunstad notes there's also a dark side. \"Humans are complex, social relations are complex, and it's just not simple,\" she said.\n\nSome relationships can be a source of stress, while others may be a combination of both positive and negative. The people we have mixed feelings about, even if we love them, can be associated with detrimental physiological effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure or increased anxiety, says Holt-Lunstad.\n\nBut what about an annual gathering with friends home for the holidays: Is this just social junk food or a nutritious social meal?\n\n\"Seeing someone we don't get to see often might strengthen our bonds and feelings of connectedness,\" Holt-Lunstad said.\n\nYang agrees, so long as the people we socialize with \"actually promote or provide the kind of support and connection that you need.\"\n\n\"Having any is better than having none,\" Yang said. \"And having more is always better.\"\n\nOf course, more social connection is one thing; more time spent in the bar is another.\n\nBeware 'Blackout Wednesday'\n\nBartenders have their own name for Thanksgiving Eve: \"Blackout Wednesday.\" The annual gathering is a time when some people throw caution to the wind.\n\nThanksgiving dinner may be the ultimate hangover cure, but too much booze is never a good thing. In particular, binge drinking is terrible for your health. Defined as five or more drinks (within two hours) for a man and four or more drinks for a woman , binge drinking can lead to accidents, cardiovascular disease and liver disease.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThere's another danger, too: Late nights and early mornings between Thanksgiving Eve through New Year's include some of the most dangerous on the nation's highways and byways. Overall, in 2014, just shy of 10,000 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . These fatalities accounted for nearly one-third of all traffic-related deaths in the United States that year. Meanwhile, drugs other than alcohol were involved in about 16% of the total car crashes.\n\nThanksgiving weekend contributed more car crash deaths than the holiday periods surrounding New Year's, Christmas, Fourth of July and Memorial Day, according to the safety administration. Only Labor Day weekend topped Thanksgiving in car crash deaths last year.\n\nAlthough Friendsgiving can be a healthy way to start the holiday season, it's also an important time to know your limits -- even if that means staying home."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "A healthier Thanksgiving in 8 traditional, simple courses", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Rj-zMqz6qEY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is a time for feasting, certainly not fasting or dieting. But if you're kicking off the holiday season with your health in mind, there are a few smart switches you can make on Turkey Day that will help boost your nutrition and lighten your calorie load.\n\nBelow are some savvy substitutions that can help you save nearly 1,200 calories for the entire meal.\n\nRed wine instead of White Russian\n\nCalories in cocktails can add up quickly, thanks to sugary mixers, tonic, juice, soda and syrups. What's more, depending on the pour, mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol (that is, more than 1.5 ounces of vodka or gin), which also boosts calories.\n\nAn 8-ounce White Russian can top 500 calories, thanks to Kahl\u00faa, vodka and heavy cream, but a 5-ounce glass of red wine has about 125 calories, or about a quarter of the amount. If you prefer the higher-calorie cocktails, limit yourself to one.\n\nCarrots and hummus instead of cheese and crackers\n\nA couple of multigrain crackers with cheddar cheese has 134 calories -- not calorie overload, but compare that with two baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus, which has only 62 calories, plus 2 grams of fiber.\n\nYou can have double the portion for fewer calories if you choose crudit\u00e9 over cheese. If you prefer dips to hummus, try substituting Greek yogurt for sour cream to shave calories and boost protein.\n\nDark-meat turkey without skin instead of with skin\n\nTruth be told, dark-meat turkey is delicious and is typically juicier and more flavorful than white meat. Plus, dark meat delivers more zinc and iron than white meat.\n\nThere's no need to forgo dark meat this Thanksgiving. But skip the skin to save some calories and saturated fat. Dark meat with skin is 175 calories per 3-ounce serving, and without skin is 147 calories. For portion control, keep your serving to 3 ounces, which is similar in size to a deck of cards or a computer mouse.\n\nVegan mushroom gravy instead of traditional gravy\n\nTurkey may not seem like \"turkey\" without gravy, as the sauce gives a flavor upgrade to any dish. But making your gravy with mushrooms instead of meat drippings. can give your bird a savory \"umami\" flavor while saving a significant amount of calories and fat.\n\nTraditional gravy is 63 calories per quarter-cup, and vegan mushroom gravy is only 35 calories. And here's another bonus to mushroom gravy: Because it is meatless, it's suitable for vegan guests. Whatever gravy you choose, try using a tablespoon when serving yourself, instead of pouring from a gravy boat, to help control your portion size.\n\nWhole-grain stuffing with kale instead of traditional stuffing\n\nStuffing is delicious, but using white bread as an ingredient is a missed nutritional opportunity, as it doesn't offer the fiber and vitamins that whole-grain bread does. Try a stuffing made with whole wheat bread, oats or quinoa to boost the nutrients.\n\nThe New York Times' whole-grain stuffing with kale, figs, dates and hazelnuts has 7 grams of fiber and about 60 fewer calories per serving than a traditional stuffing. Traditional stuffing is about 420 calories per cup, while whole-grain stuffing with kale and dried fruit is 357 calories.\n\nBaked sweet potato instead of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows\n\nSweet potatoes are nutritious and delicious and can help you achieve smooth, glowing skin, as they are loaded with vitamin A. However, when you add brown sugar, butter and marshmallows, you're pretty much eating dessert.\n\nOne serving of candied sweet potato casserole with marshmallows packs 405 calories, 19 grams of fat and 32 grams of sugar. A whole baked sweet potato has only 130 calories and only 9 grams of natural sugar. You can even add some toasted marshmallows for an extra 30 calories.\n\nLow-fat green bean casserole instead of traditional green bean casserole\n\nTraditional green bean casserole is a Thanksgiving staple that is about 24 calories per cup, but the healthier eatingwell.com version with breadcrumbs instead of French fried onions has only 188 calories per cup.\n\nIf you like the traditional green bean casserole recipe, you can use fresher, lower-fat ingredients that will improve the healthfulness of the dish and the flavor. Simply substitute the French fried onions with fresh onions (you can bake them after soaking them in buttermilk and coating with breadcrumbs and flour), and use low-fat condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular version. You can also substitute low-fat milk (like 1%) for whole milk, which saves calories and saturated fat.\n\nPumpkin pie instead of pecan pie\n\nThere's no need to skip dessert, but by choosing pumpkin pie over pecan pie, you can save over 200 calories. Pecan pie is about 541 calories per slice, and pumpkin is 323 calories. Apple pie is another lower-calorie choice compared with pecan, at 363 calories per slice. If you can't resist pecan pie (and who could blame you), take a thin slice, or go crustless and eat only the filling. And hold off on the whipped cream!\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMake all these substitutes, and your total calorie savings is 1,179.

Over the past five years, after deciding that she wanted to feel and look better, she changed her eating and exercise habits and finally lost that leftover weight, and then maintained her new physique. But it hasn't come without challenges.\n\n\"Holidays are tough, man, really tough,\" she said. Unlike work gatherings, family celebrations are not problematic for Sanderson, who allows herself to enjoy the occasional splurge meal for what it is.\n\n\"Holiday gatherings at work are the most troublesome,\" she said. \"People bring in all these fatty, calorie-heavy foods, lots of desserts, and when you're looking at a buffet of 20 different things and there's only one plate of fruit, what are you supposed to do?\"\n\nMalkani points out that \"one meal is not going to make or break a nutritious lifestyle or a weight loss goal. What's more important is the totality of the nutrition lifestyle.\"\n\nThere are strategies to put in place when you find yourself facing a food pusher or diet saboteur.\n\nOne of Malkani's favorites involves preparing yourself. \"It sounds so simple, but it is sometimes difficult to do unless you've practiced -- but to have your simple, 'No, thank you' statement prepared. It can be polite, it can be charming, it can be whatever makes you feel comfortable, but to be prepared to say, 'No, thank you' ... is very important,\" Malkani said.\n\nAnother tip is having a healthy and nutritious meal or snack before attending an event so you are less tempted to overeat. And if you do slip up, remember that it's not the end of the world, as long as you go back to your normal habits.\n\nNotes for hosts\n\nIt's not just those focused on weight and lifestyle who can face problems when it comes to food pushers. However well-meaning the host, there are sometimes health risks related to eating something you don't normally consume.\n\n\"We know they come from a position of love, and we love them for who they are, but it is important, especially for those who have food allergies or intolerances or sensitivities [or] an autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease, to be able to set firm boundaries around foods that will cause a reaction,\" Malkani said.\n\n\"I usually just go and don't eat,\" Kendra Chapman says of holiday parties.\n\nKendra Chapman knows that the holiday season can be a risky time. \"I get invited to all of these holiday parties, and of course I want to go, and I always feel like I don't get the full experience of having the food and drinking the drinks and doing all the things,\" she said.\n\nhas more than 20 food allergies, including peanuts and citric acid. Some are deadly and can cause her to go into anaphylactic shock; others will cause stomach issues, hives and itching. After being diagnosed with most them just over three years ago, she started a blog, Chapman, 28, of Los Angeles,has more than 20 food allergies, including peanuts and citric acid. Some are deadly and can cause her to go into anaphylactic shock; others will cause stomach issues, hives and itching. After being diagnosed with most them just over three years ago, she started a blog, Nope, Can't Eat That Either , chronicling her experience.\n\n\"I think that well-meaning hosts prepare these beautiful meals, and oftentimes, it includes things that some of the guests can't eat,\" said Diane Gottsman , national etiquette expert and founder of the Protocol School of Texas . \"I'm not talking about things that make you sick. If you have a gluten intolerance, if you have a serious nut allergy, you just have to let the host know and don't feel any remorse about not eating it.\"\n\nAlthough Chapman doesn't think people sabotage her diet in a malicious way, there are times when she must remind them about her dietary requirements.\n\n\"One thing that happens a lot is, people forget,\" she said. This often happens with co-workers and new acquaintances. \"It's harmless. They aren't trying to force me to eat things. It's literally just that they forget.\"\n\nAfter she spends some time with people, though, they often become as protective of what she eats as she is.\n\n\"My family [is] very accommodating to me, but going to friends' houses, like holiday parties for instance, it's a nightmare,\" she said. \"I usually just go and don't eat, because people don't really understand the gravity of allergies, which is unfortunate because you're in a room full of 50 people, and you're the only one not eating.\"\n\nBYO dish\n\nFor Gottsman, everyone at an event -- be it a Thanksgiving meal or a Christmas party -- must be conscious of how people with allergies or dietary requirements feel.\n\n\"A gracious guest is not going to make another guest feel uncomfortable. And a gracious host and a good host will never want their guest to feel uncomfortable by making them feel uncomfortable for not eating,\" she said.\n\nHosts should try to have options available for guests who may have food allergies or intolerances, Gottsman said.\n\n\"They should offer some alternatives, such as a fruit tray or even a cheese tray, if you are nut-allergic. They should prepare in advance for restrictions. But also, they should ask the guests if there is anything they should be aware of,\" she said.\n\nHowever, these alternatives come with their own risks. Chapman also has to be aware of issues such as cross-contamination when she attends events.\n\n\"You'll have a spread of food, and one thing might be completely safe, but they'll have something at the other end of the table that's not, and people will use the same spoon or the same fork, and now I really can't eat it,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Chapman often doesn't eat at parties, one way to increase the potential food options is to contribute, according to Gottsman.\n\n\"You can let [the host] know in advance, 'Listen, I'm going to come, but ... I have some severe allergies, and I would love to bring a casserole that I can share with everyone,' \" she said.\n\nBringing your own dish also can be helpful if you're a vegan or vegetarian.\n\n\"Bring enough food for everybody, or bring enough food for five or 10 people, for part of the party,\" said Len Torine , executive director of the American Vegetarian Association\n\nBringing enough to share means that you have something to eat, and it keeps you from standing out.\n\nAs with other dietary requirements, there are times when the families and friends of those who are vegan or vegetarian don't sabotage on purpose.\n\n\"I am not sure If they meant to, but during Thanksgiving, there was gravy sitting out, and I asked, 'Is this vegetarian?' They replied 'yes,' probably thinking 'there is not meat in this.' Turns out there was chicken broth in it, and I ate it,\" Emma Huehns, a vegetarian in Wisconsin, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nHuehns, 17, started her vegetarian diet about a year ago and is the only non-meat-eater in her family.\n\nThough they are generally supportive -- her dad even went vegetarian for a week with her -- she still has some struggles.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I have also been told many times by my grandparents that chicken and fish isn't meat. [My grandmother] even tried to tell me that I could have something she made when it had meat in it, because she said it wouldn't hurt if I had just a little,\" she said.\n\nAlthough you may face some resistance from family or have to avoid certain foods being served at parties, for Torine, the main point of the holidays is to enjoy yourself and have fun with friends and family. For him, this means not explaining your diet choices or making them the central focus.\n\n\"You don't want to spoil anyone's party. You don't want to pontificate.

There isn't a majority in the House of Commons for that to take place.\"\n\nAsked if she would back another referendum, like some of her fellow Remain-voting Tory MPs on the backbenches, Ms Rudd said: \"I don't think we are looking at another referendum.\"\n\nShe said MPs would \"take a careful look over the abyss\" and decide it was in the \"best interests of the country\" to vote for Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n\nWhat is the draft withdrawal agreement? The 585-page document focuses on the terms of the UK's departure and not on any permanent future relationship. It includes how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill), details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It also covers the so-called \"backstop\", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks. The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. Two cabinet ministers have resigned over the deal, others are believed to be trying to change its wording and there has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered. The EU will consider the agreement at its summit on 25 November, but it is yet to be approved by Parliament.\n\nMrs May appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least.\n\nHowever, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal - which will be put before European leaders this weekend.\n\nAll sides in the Commons have warned of a \"blind Brexit\" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements.\n\nThe withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\" and the controversial customs \"backstop\" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tory Remainer Ken Clarke MP tells Newsnight he will support the prime minister's Brexit deal to get us \"to the transition\".\n\nHowever, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments.\n\nAny binding trade deal would still have to be thrashed out in the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some UK ministers still believed there was time for a few \"nips and tucks\" to the withdrawal agreement reached in principle last week.\n\nWhy is May rushing to Brussels?\n\nBy Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor\n\nImage copyright Adrian Dennis/Getty Images\n\nCould this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics?\n\nGrumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend.\n\nThey're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Theresa May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nEngaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for Mrs May.\n\nA high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a (presumably planned) late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow the prime minister to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard won\u2026 in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.\n\nDiscussions in Brussels focus on the political declaration outlining relations from the scheduled end of the transition period in 2021.

It is a victory for the Supreme Court chief justice, Professor Malgorzata Gersdorf, her retired colleagues and the European Commission.\n\nBut it's not much of a defeat for the governing Law and Justice camp's judicial reforms. It has already managed the appointment of the majority of judges to the Constitutional Tribunal, which has the power to veto legislation. The justice minister, who also serves as the prosecutor general, now has the power to appoint and dismiss the deputies and heads of ordinary courts. And the governing camp also now controls the National Council of the Judiciary (NCJ), the body that nominates all judges in Poland.\n\nPlus, by reinstating the Supreme Court judges, the government will avoid the possibility of having to pay hefty daily fines for non-compliance with last month's ECJ ruling. In a few years time, those reinstated judges will retire. In the meantime, dozens of new judges for two new Supreme Court chambers created by Law and Justice will need to be appointed and they will be nominated by the newly politicised NCJ.\n\nWhat did the EU say?\n\nThe European Commission - the EU's executive arm - argued that the reforms undermined the rule of law because they gave the governing party political control of the judiciary.\n\nIt referred the matter to the Luxembourg-based ECJ which in October ordered Poland to \"immediately suspend\" the application of its law.\n\nThe court ordered Poland to reinstate the judges who had been forced to retire.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Malgorzata Gersdorf, head of Poland's Supreme Court, refused to step down\n\nThe ECJ said its decision was an interim measure in response to the commission's request and a final ruling would be issued at a later date.\n\nAt the time, the head of the PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said the government would comply with the decision.\n\n\"We are members of the European Union and we will abide by European Union law,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "American 'killed in India by endangered Andamans tribe'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46286215", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:00:25", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Indian coastguard/Survival International Image caption The Sentinelese have always resisted outside contact\n\nAn American man has been killed by an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands.\n\nFishermen who took the man to North Sentinel island say tribespeople shot him with arrows and left his body on the beach.\n\nHe has been identified as John Allen Chau, a 27 year old from Alabama.\n\nContact with the endangered Andaman tribes living in isolation from the world is illegal because of the risks to them from outside disease.\n\nEstimates say the Sentinelese, who are totally cut off from civilisation, number only between 50 and 150.\n\nSeven fishermen have been arrested for illegally ferrying the American to the island, police say.\n\nImage copyright Instagram/John Chau Image caption On 21 October, @johnachau posted that he was travelling to the region\n\nLocal media have reported that Chau may have wanted to meet the tribe to preach Christianity to them.\n\nBut on social media the young man presented himself as a keen traveller and adventurer.\n\n\"Police said Chau had previously visited North Sentinel island about four or five times with the help of local fishermen,\" journalist Subir Bhaumik, who has been covering the islands for years, told BBC Hindi.\n\n\"The number of people belonging to the Sentinelese tribe is so low, they don't even understand how to use money.

The 585-page document focuses on the terms of the UK's departure and not on any permanent future relationship. It includes how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill), details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It also covers the so-called \"backstop\", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks. The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. Two cabinet ministers have resigned over the deal, others are believed to be trying to change its wording and there has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered. The EU will consider the agreement at its summit on 25 November, but it is yet to be approved by Parliament.\n\nMrs May appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least.\n\nHowever, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal - which will be put before European leaders this weekend.\n\nAll sides in the Commons have warned of a \"blind Brexit\" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements.\n\nThe withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\" and the controversial customs \"backstop\" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tory Remainer Ken Clarke MP tells Newsnight he will support the prime minister's Brexit deal to get us \"to the transition\".\n\nHowever, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments.\n\nAny binding trade deal would still have to be thrashed out in the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some UK ministers still believed there was time for a few \"nips and tucks\" to the withdrawal agreement reached in principle last week.\n\nWhy is May rushing to Brussels?\n\nBy Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor\n\nImage copyright Adrian Dennis/Getty Images\n\nCould this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics?\n\nGrumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend.\n\nThey're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Theresa May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nEngaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for Mrs May.\n\nA high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a (presumably planned) late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow the prime minister to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard won\u2026 in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.\n\nDiscussions in Brussels focus on the political declaration outlining relations from the scheduled end of the transition period in 2021.

Instead, their reasoning challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online, with implications which go far beyond just Facebook, which is why we have chosen to appeal.\n\n\"For example, under the ICO's theory people should not be allowed to forward an email or message without having agreement from each person on the original thread.\n\n\"These are things done by millions of people every day on services across the internet, which is why we believe the ICO's decision raises important questions of principle for everyone online which should be considered by an impartial court based on all the relevant evidence.\"\n\nAn independent body, known as a General Regulatory Chamber tribunal, will consider the challenge.\n\nIf it is unhappy with the decision, Facebook can subsequently take the case to the Court of Appeal.\n\n\"Any organisation issued with a monetary penalty notice by the Information Commissioner has the right to appeal the decision to the First-tier Tribunal,\" said a spokesman for the ICO.\n\n\"The progression of any appeal is a matter for the tribunal. We have not yet been notified by the tribunal that an appeal has been received.\"\n\nThe appeal risks dragging out an affair that has undermined the public and politicians' trust in Facebook.\n\nHowever, the BBC understands that the US firm was concerned that the ICO's ruling would form the basis for decisions taken by other regulators, which could prove more damaging still.\n\nThe ICO has itself noted that the \u00a3500,000 fine would be \"significantly higher\" had the EU's General Data Protection Regulation been in force earlier.\n\nThe move has not, however, changed chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's mind about rejecting an invitation to be cross-examined by MPs.\n\nAnalysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/BBC Image caption The stakes are high for both Facebook's chief and the UK's Information Commissioner\n\nFacebook's decision to appeal against this fine is a move that Sir Humphrey, the civil servant in Yes Minister, would describe as \"brave\".\n\nAt a time when the social media firm is under fire and accused of using dodgy tactics to combat its critics, picking a fight with the UK regulator over an issue which was beginning to fade into the background seems reckless.\n\nAfter all, the social media giant admits that it got a whole lot of things wrong in the Cambridge Analytica affair, in particular allowing the data of friends of people who took part in a personality quiz to be scraped.\n\nBut Facebook feels that the Information Commissioner's Office moved the goalposts halfway through its investigation, deciding that one million UK users had suffered harm and then finding that the researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan did not pass their data on to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nSome data protection experts think the company has a point.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and his company appear determined to fight back against what they see as a flawed process but the appeal is a gamble.\n\nThe stakes are also high for the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.

There isn't a majority in the House of Commons for that to take place.\"\n\nAsked if she would back another referendum, like some of her fellow Remain-voting Tory MPs on the backbenches, Ms Rudd said: \"I don't think we are looking at another referendum.\"\n\nShe said MPs would \"take a careful look over the abyss\" and decide it was in the \"best interests of the country\" to vote for Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n\nWhat is the draft withdrawal agreement? The 585-page document focuses on the terms of the UK's departure and not on any permanent future relationship. It includes how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill), details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It also covers the so-called \"backstop\", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks. The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. Two cabinet ministers have resigned over the deal, others are believed to be trying to change its wording and there has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered. The EU will consider the agreement at its summit on 25 November, but it is yet to be approved by Parliament.\n\nMrs May appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least.\n\nHowever, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal - which will be put before European leaders this weekend.\n\nAll sides in the Commons have warned of a \"blind Brexit\" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements.\n\nThe withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\" and the controversial customs \"backstop\" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tory Remainer Ken Clarke MP tells Newsnight he will support the prime minister's Brexit deal to get us \"to the transition\".\n\nHowever, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments.\n\nAny binding trade deal would still have to be thrashed out in the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some UK ministers still believed there was time for a few \"nips and tucks\" to the withdrawal agreement reached in principle last week.\n\nWhy is May rushing to Brussels?\n\nBy Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor\n\nImage copyright Adrian Dennis/Getty Images\n\nCould this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics?\n\nGrumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend.\n\nThey're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Theresa May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nEngaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for Mrs May.\n\nA high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a (presumably planned) late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow the prime minister to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard won\u2026 in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.\n\nDiscussions in Brussels focus on the political declaration outlining relations from the scheduled end of the transition period in 2021.

Here's what happened.\n\nTheresa May got a taste of what is to come if she manages to return from Brussels with a Brexit deal, as she came under fire from every Brexit faction in the Commons - and faced calls from Jeremy Corbyn to stand aside and let Labour have a go.\n\nThe Labour leader zeroed in on comments by new Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who said MPs would prevent a no-deal Brexit, apparently putting her at odds with the PM's \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" stance.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: Has PM ruled out no-deal Brexit?\n\nHe asked: \"Does the prime minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal?\"\n\nMrs May replied \"no\" and said the alternative to her deal would \"either be more uncertainty, more division or it could risk no Brexit at all\".\n\n\"Isn't it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal,\" asked Mr Corbyn, \"and if the government can't negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.\"\n\nMrs May replied: \"He is opposing a deal he hasn't read, he's promising a deal he can't negotiate, he's telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever (Mr Corbyn) will do, I will act in the national interest.\"\n\nMr Corbyn then asked whether the withdrawal agreement was finalised or whether there will be changes to come.\n\nMrs May said it was \"part of a package\" with the political declaration on the future relationship with the European Union.\n\nMr Corbyn made time for a dig at new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, noting that Mrs May was heading to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, rather than him.\n\nHe called Mr Barclay another \"non-travelling\" Brexit Secretary and wondered whether the post was now \"entirely ceremonial\". Mr Barclay managed a grin.\n\nThen it was on to the transition period, that is due to kick-in after Brexit day in March, that the business secretary said earlier this week could be extended to 2022.\n\nMr Corbyn said it meant being outside of the EU and with no leverage. \"Does she think she is fooling anyone\" that she will get a free trade agreement by the end of 2020, asked the Labour leader.\n\nMrs May said the future relationship document, currently the subject of intense negotiations, will set out \"the structure and scope\" of the deal.\n\n\"He says there is a problem and he would do it differently,\" she went on, \"he is playing party politics, I am working in the national interest\".\n\nThe prime minister had said in February that \"a border down the Irish Sea is something no UK prime minister could ever agree to\", said Mr Corbyn, so why would the backstop do just that? It wouldn't, said Mrs May.\n\nThe pair repeated their attack lines before Mrs May brought their clash to an end with a declaration that \"the public gave us an instruction to leave the European Union\".\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nMrs May rejected a call from the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would \"frustrate the vote of the British people\".\n\nThe prime minister branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, \"absolutely ridiculous,\" saying the public had given this Parliament \"an instruction\" to leave the EU.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Caroline Lucas: \"Does PM think democracy ended on 23 June 2016?\"\n\nTory MP Bob Neill asked about Gibraltar.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption May: Gibraltar will not be excluded from Brexit talks\n\nEsther McVey, who quit the cabinet last week over the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement, asked whether the UK was definitely going to leave the EU on 29 March.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nTheresa May must have felt that she picked up today where she left off on Thursday, with another rolling interrogation on Brexit. And she quickly defaulted into her weary-but-resolute mode.\n\nBackbench Brexiteer Andrew Rossindell kicked off proceedings with a direct appeal for the PM to change course on Brexit, saying her plan was not the Brexit his Romford constituents voted for. Then Jeremy Corbyn piled in with a well-targeted question picking up comments from ministers that \"no deal\" was not an option, and asking if there were any circumstances where the UK would quit the EU without a deal - a question the prime minister didn't really answer.\n\nThe confusion deepened a little later, when the PM confirmed to her ex-colleague Esther McVey that the UK would leave on the appointed date of 29 March - which at least implied that this was possible without a deal, and also seemed to pull back from previous warnings that failing to back her proposed Brexit deal risked \"no Brexit at all\".\n\nAnother important moment came when the DUP Leader Nigel Dodds confirmed that his party's relations with the government remain in the deep freeze, when he asked a hostile question about the disappearance of a government promise that the people of Northern Ireland would have the final say on any divergence from the UK's single market.\n\nYou could hear the acid drip as he asked: \"Did she press the delete button?\"\n\nNo sign of kissing and making up there. And that matters because it is hard to see how the PM's deal gets through the Commons without Mr Dodds and his troops (now restored to full strength with the return from suspension of Ian Paisley Jr).\n\nIt was a noisy session but I was expecting it to be noisier still.\n\nPart of the reason may be that the big-name Brexiteers who have been trying to unseat the PM did not intervene, which would surely have produced cheers and jeers aplenty (Jacob Rees-Mogg was in the chamber, but did not attempt to speak and left before the end of the session).\n\nAnother factor is that neither of the two main players was able to sound a clear trumpet note to their troops.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was in an excellent position to call for a second referendum, but clearly had no intention of doing so, and his mainly-Remainer MPs were not, therefore, delighted.\n\nWe already know that Theresa May's deal has not exactly delighted Conservative MPs either (even the ones who support it) and a series of questions on the details (Bob Neill on Gibraltar, George Freeman on Northern Ireland, Neil Parish on agriculture) caught the wary mood on the Tory benches.\n\nIt seemed to me that the two leaders were both better at attacking each other than defending their own positions, which meant that a lot of time was taken up with accusations of \"more muddled than thou\".\n\nBut the bottom line is that it is now close to impossible - in the absence of any overriding mega-event - to talk about anything but Brexit at PMQs."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link":

The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people.\n\nHow did the charity work out the death toll?\n\nIt is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open.\n\nSave the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN.

In some Slavic languages the word \"jezero\" also means \"lake\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Mars 2020 rover is based on the design of the Curiosity robot\n\nHow does 2020 link to future missions?\n\nAnother of the robot's key objectives will be to select and \"cache\" in small canisters some rock samples that could, at a later date, be collected and returned to Earth labs for analysis.\n\nNasa is working with the European Space Agency (Esa) on this initiative, but exactly when the sample tubes might come home is uncertain.\n\nPlanning with Esa was at an early stage, said Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's science chief. \"Depending on how the details come out, it could be in the early 2030s,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The 2020 mission will again use a \"Skycrane\" to put the rover on the surface\n\nIs the 2020 rover a copy of Curiosity?\n\nThe 2020 rover is based on the one-tonne Curiosity robot that the agency landed in Gale Crater in 2012. Curiosity has been a great success, and Nasa wants to repeat it. Using the same \"template\" also saves money; some equipment spares were left over from 2012.\n\nThat said, instrument-wise, the new vehicle is quite a bit different. Yes, it will again feature cameras, a robotic arm, a drill and a laser - but there is a new suite of sensors and analysis tools, and there is even an experiment to demonstrate how future astronauts might make oxygen on the Red Planet.\n\nThe new robot will use the same \"Skycrane\" technology that put Curiosity down with such great precision six years ago - but with an add-on. Engineers have developed an on-the-fly mapping system called Terrain-Relative Navigation which ought to bring even greater accuracy to the landing process.\n\nWhat else can we look forward to on Mars?\n\nMissions to Mars can only launch inside a tight time window due to the alignment of the planets.\n\nThe 2020 venture will leave Earth in the July/August of that year and should land on 18 February 2021.\n\n\"Nasa has a long and successful track record at Mars. Since Mariner 4 flew by Mars in 1965, we've orbited, we've landed and we've roved across the surface of the Red Planet,\" said Lori Glaze, the acting director of Nasa's planetary science division. \"And we've got another opportunity to improve our track record a week from today when we land InSight on the surface. We're all looking forward to that.\"\n\nUnlike 2020 and Curiosity, Insight is a static lander. It will be the first mission dedicated to \"looking inside\" the planet. It will use seismometers to listen for \"Marsquakes\", to help build a picture of Mars' internal structure.\n\nEsa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 also. European scientists recently selected Oxia Planum as its destination. Satellite imagery suggests, as with Jezero and Gale, this ancient terrain came into prolonged contact with water.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Millipede so rare 'it doesn't even have a name' discovered", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46290108", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Liam Olds Image caption The millipede was first spotted in 2017 in Bridgend\n\nA millipede so rare it is \"new to science\" and does not even have a common name, has been found in Neath Port Talbot.\n\nYoungsters on a Halloween insect hunt found the bug at Craig Gwladus Country Park, near Cilfrew, on 30 October.\n\nIt has since been identified as the Turdulisoma cf turdulorum millipede, so rare it is only the third known site where it has been found.\n\nThe first was Aberkenfig, Bridgend, in 2017, by local expert Christian Owen.\n\nIt was subsequently confirmed as a new species by Dr J\u00f6rg Spelda at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Germany.\n\nAll findings have been in south Wales, with the Craig Gwladus discovery uncovered among leaf litter and under old wood along the former Gelliau Colliery Tramroad at the park.\n\nLiam Olds, from conservation group Buglife Cymru, said sites associated with Wales' coalmining heritage were \"very important places for rare and scarce animal and plant species, especially invertebrates\".\n\nHe added: \"Discoveries such as this highlight the importance of such sites and why they need to be conserved.\n\n\"As the species is new to science, we know nothing about it.\n\n\"It could be a native species that has been previously overlooked because so few people record invertebrates in south Wales, or it could have been an introduced species from abroad.\"\n\nMr Olds said scientists would probably never know for certain."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Elon Musk renames his BFR spacecraft Starship", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46274158", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright SpaceX\n\nElon Musk has changed the name of his forthcoming passenger spaceship from Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) to Starship.\n\nThe entrepreneur would not reveal why he had renamed the craft, which has not yet been built, but added its rocket booster will be called Super Heavy.\n\nIn September, Mr Musk's SpaceX company announced that Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa had signed up to be the first passenger to travel on the ship.\n\nThe mission is planned for 2023 if the spaceship is built by that time.\n\nIt is the craft's fourth name - it started out as Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT) and then became Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) before becoming BFR.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nOver the weekend, Mr Musk tweeted that the spaceship was being redesigned, saying the new version was \"very exciting.

cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

He added that Congress will consider \"all the tools at our disposal\" to determine the role of the crown prince in the Khashoggi killing.\n\n\n\nKhashoggi lived in the United States, writing opinion articles for The Washington Post that were critical of the crown prince and Riyadh's military involvement in Yemen.\n\n\n\nHis editor at the Post, Karen Attiah, described Trump's statement as \"full of lies and a blatant disregard for his own intelligence agencies.

Most here say they have no other health care option.\n\n\"I've never had health insurance - never,\" says Benny Cardenas, a construction worker who constantly worries he is an injury away from being in long-term debt. \"This here, it's free. It's worth the sacrifice - a couple hours of no sleep (rather) than paying thousands of dollars.\"\n\nSusan Stephenson, a truck driver from Houston, Texas, is already missing most of her upper teeth. Though she has medical insurance, she can't afford to go to the dentist. \"The copay is so outrageous, it's like not having insurance at all,\" says Stephenson, who drove four hours to attend the RAM Clinic.\n\nInsurance problems persist\n\nStephenson's story is common. Most Americans get health insurance through their employers, or through government-provided insurance for older and lower-income people. Millions of other people have received health insurance in recent years under the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. But many still cannot afford basic dental or vision services.\n\nSince the 2010 passage of the legislation known as \"Obamacare,\" the uninsured rate has fallen from 16 percent to less than 9 percent, according to figures by the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut 23 percent of Americans have no dental coverage, according to the National Association of Dental Plans.\n\nEven with insurance, costs can be prohibitive. Over 44 percent of Americans report difficulty paying for dental care and 11 percent of adults age 18-64 have foregone needed dental work altogether because of costs, according to a recent CDC study.\n\nAshley Bowman, who needs two cavities filled, has a state-subsidized health care plan, but it doesn't include dental coverage. \"I'm not sure why,\" she says. \"It just doesn't.\"\n\nSo she's huddled under an awning with several of her friends in the middle of the night - a small price to pay, she insists. \"Just for one filling, that's already half your rent! That's a lot just for one tooth.\"\n\nPartisan deadlock over voters' top issue\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, health care is a major priority for U.S. voters. According to exit polls taken during midterm elections, 41 percent of voters identified health care as their top concern - beating out every other issue, including immigration and the economy.\n\nIt's not hard to see why. The U.S. spends approximately twice what other high-income nations do on health care, yet has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest life expectancy, according to a March study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe high costs are not because Americans are getting more medical care. Rates of doctor visits are roughly equal to the 10 other countries in the study. Instead, it concluded health spending is being driven by factors including the steep costs of prescription drugs, administrative tasks, and physician and nurse salaries.\n\nBut any legislative movement on health care appears more unlikely than ever after the election, which saw Democrats take back the House of Representatives, creating a divided Congress.\n\nMany Republicans have called for a complete repeal of Obamacare, but would not be able to get such a plan through the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nMore liberal-leaning Democrats have increasingly proposed a \"Medicare for All\" program to expand government-run health care plans to cover all Americans. But Republicans fiercely oppose the proposal, saying it amounts to an inefficient government takeover of health care.\n\nRAM filling the gap\n\nAmid the partisan deadlock, privately-funded clinics like the one in West Virginia continue to provide free health care to as many people as they can across the country.\n\nEach year, Remote Area Medical operates more than 60 mobile medical clinics. About 90 percent are in the U.S., mostly in rural areas.\n\nRAM founder Stan Brock started holding the clinics in the 1980s in developing Latin American countries, such as Guyana, Mexico, and Haiti. It didn't take long before he realized one of the biggest needs was at home.\n\n\"You can blindfold yourself and put your finger on the map of the U.S. and we could go there and this will happen there,\" says RAM's Robert Lambert. \"The need is just huge.\"\n\nAt this two-day clinic in Charleston, RAM provided about $300,000 worth of free medical care to 775 patients. That figure may be small when compared to the vastness of U.S. health care problems. But for people here, it's a lifesaver.\n\n\"If I didn't have a place like this to get my glasses, I'd be totally lost,\" says Rosemary Pauley, a retiree who says she's \"blind as a bat.\"\n\n\"I'd be sitting at home doing nothing,\" she says."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Free Clinics Fill Huge Gaps in US Health Care System", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/free-clinics-fill-huge-gaps-in-us-health-care-system-/4667726.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "The most important issue for many U.S. voters in this month\u2019s midterm elections wasn\u2019t the economy.

Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the likely incoming chairman of the Oversight panel, said Tuesday that he will resume that bipartisan investigation, which was dropped by Republicans. And he will pressure President Donald Trump's administration to turn over records about the use of private email for public business by Ivanka Trump, Kushner and other senior officials.\n\n\"My goal is to prevent this from happening again \u2014 not to turn this into a spectacle the way Republicans went after Hillary Clinton,\" Cummings said. \"My main priority as Chairman will be to focus on the issues that impact Americans in their everyday lives.\"\n\nThe issue resurfaced this week when The Washington Post reported that the president's daughter, while a top White House adviser, sent hundreds of emails about government business from a personal email account last year. The emails were sent to White House aides, Cabinet members and Ivanka Trump's assistants, many in violation of public records rules, according to the Post.\n\nIn comments to reporters, the president, who has spent years railing against Clinton's use of private email for public business while secretary of state, sought to downplay \u2014 and differentiate \u2014 his daughter's email use from his former opponent's.\n\n\"They aren't classified like Hillary Clinton. They weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton,\" Trump said, adding: \"What Ivanka did, it's all in the presidential records.

The spokesman, Peter Mirijanian, said no classified information was transmitted in the messages, no emails were deleted and the emails have since been \"retained'' in conformity with records laws. He also said Ivanka Trump did not set up a private server for the account, which he said was \"never transferred or housed at Trump Organization.\"\n\nMirijanian said that while transitioning into the government, Ivanka Trump \"sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family.\"\n\n\"When concerns were raised in the press 14 months ago, Ms. Trump reviewed and verified her email use with White House Counsel and explained the issue to congressional leaders,\" he said. He did not say which congressional leaders were briefed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a fierce defender of the president as the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, also downplayed the matter.\n\n\"There are over 30,000 BleachBit reasons why the Hillary Clinton email scandal isn't even close to the Ivanka email issue,\" Meadows tweeted, referring to a computer program used to delete emails from her server.\n\nThe House Oversight investigation into private email used by Trump White House officials was launched in early 2017 with the support of then-Republican chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz. After Chaffetz retired from Congress, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina joined with Cummings in demanding that the White House provide the identities of staff members who had used their personal emails to conduct official business.\n\nIn October 2017, the White House dispatched counsel's office lawyers Stefan Passantino, Uttam Dhillon and Daniel Epstein to brief bipartisan committee staff, but the attorneys refused to identify any officials who had used private email for official business. The lawyers only said that several White House employees had \"confessed\" to failing to following the Presidential Records Act, according to a letter summarizing the briefing released by Cummings earlier this year.\n\nThe White House lawyers said they couldn't provide additional information on specific employees while an internal review was under way, according to the letter.\n\nBut the White House lawyers said they would share the findings of the internal review with the committee once it concluded, according to a separate letter sent to the White House by Gowdy.\n\nCummings has said the committee never received that information, and Democrats have said Gowdy dropped the issue and never followed up.\n\nThe discovery of the extent of Ivanka Trump's email use was prompted by public records requests from the liberal watchdog group American Oversight. The group's executive director, Austin Evers, said in a statement that \"The president's family is not above the law,\u2019\" and he called on Congress to investigate.\n\n\"For more than two years, President Trump and senior leaders in Congress have made it very clear that they view the use of personal email servers for government business to be a serious offense that demands investigation and even prosecution, and we expect the same standard will be applied in this case,\" he said.\n\nThe emails the group uncovered include correspondence between Ivanka Trump and Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Poll Gives Trump High Marks Only on Economy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/poll-gives-trump-high-marks-only-on-economy/4666784.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "A new Quinnipiac University poll shows most American voters approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the economy.\n\nFifty-three percent of the voters surveyed approved of the way he has overseen the economy, his most favorable rating ever on the issue, the poll found.

The lawmakers and other critics of the investigation have contended that the nomination of Whitaker, as head of a Cabinet-level agency, was subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is denying senators our constitutional obligation and opportunity to do our job: scrutinizing the nomination of our nation\u2019s top law enforcement official,\" Blumenthal said in a statement. \"The reason is simple: Whitaker would never pass the advice and consent test. In selecting a so-called 'constitutional nobody' and thwarting every senator\u2019s constitutional duty, Trump leaves us no choice but to seek recourse through the courts.\u201d\n\nSenator Whitehouse said, \"The stakes are too high to allow the president to install an unconfirmed lackey to lead the Department of Justice \u2013 a lackey whose stated purpose, apparently, is undermining a major investigation into the president.

It's worth the sacrifice - a couple hours of no sleep (rather) than paying thousands of dollars.\"\n\nSusan Stephenson, a truck driver from Houston, Texas, is already missing most of her upper teeth. Though she has medical insurance, she can't afford to go to the dentist. \"The copay is so outrageous, it's like not having insurance at all,\" says Stephenson, who drove four hours to attend the RAM Clinic.\n\nInsurance problems persist\n\nStephenson's story is common. Most Americans get health insurance through their employers, or through government-provided insurance for older and lower-income people. Millions of other people have received health insurance in recent years under the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. But many still cannot afford basic dental or vision services.\n\nSince the 2010 passage of the legislation known as \"Obamacare,\" the uninsured rate has fallen from 16 percent to less than 9 percent, according to figures by the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut 23 percent of Americans have no dental coverage, according to the National Association of Dental Plans.\n\nEven with insurance, costs can be prohibitive. Over 44 percent of Americans report difficulty paying for dental care and 11 percent of adults age 18-64 have foregone needed dental work altogether because of costs, according to a recent CDC study.\n\nAshley Bowman, who needs two cavities filled, has a state-subsidized health care plan, but it doesn't include dental coverage. \"I'm not sure why,\" she says. \"It just doesn't.\"\n\nSo she's huddled under an awning with several of her friends in the middle of the night - a small price to pay, she insists. \"Just for one filling, that's already half your rent! That's a lot just for one tooth.\"\n\nPartisan deadlock over voters' top issue\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, health care is a major priority for U.S. voters. According to exit polls taken during midterm elections, 41 percent of voters identified health care as their top concern - beating out every other issue, including immigration and the economy.\n\nIt's not hard to see why. The U.S. spends approximately twice what other high-income nations do on health care, yet has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest life expectancy, according to a March study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe high costs are not because Americans are getting more medical care. Rates of doctor visits are roughly equal to the 10 other countries in the study. Instead, it concluded health spending is being driven by factors including the steep costs of prescription drugs, administrative tasks, and physician and nurse salaries.\n\nBut any legislative movement on health care appears more unlikely than ever after the election, which saw Democrats take back the House of Representatives, creating a divided Congress.\n\nMany Republicans have called for a complete repeal of Obamacare, but would not be able to get such a plan through the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nMore liberal-leaning Democrats have increasingly proposed a \"Medicare for All\" program to expand government-run health care plans to cover all Americans. But Republicans fiercely oppose the proposal, saying it amounts to an inefficient government takeover of health care.\n\nRAM filling the gap\n\nAmid the partisan deadlock, privately-funded clinics like the one in West Virginia continue to provide free health care to as many people as they can across the country.\n\nEach year, Remote Area Medical operates more than 60 mobile medical clinics. About 90 percent are in the U.S., mostly in rural areas.\n\nRAM founder Stan Brock started holding the clinics in the 1980s in developing Latin American countries, such as Guyana, Mexico, and Haiti. It didn't take long before he realized one of the biggest needs was at home.\n\n\"You can blindfold yourself and put your finger on the map of the U.S. and we could go there and this will happen there,\" says RAM's Robert Lambert. \"The need is just huge.\"\n\nAt this two-day clinic in Charleston, RAM provided about $300,000 worth of free medical care to 775 patients. That figure may be small when compared to the vastness of U.S. health care problems. But for people here, it's a lifesaver.\n\n\"If I didn't have a place like this to get my glasses, I'd be totally lost,\" says Rosemary Pauley, a retiree who says she's \"blind as a bat.\"\n\n\"I'd be sitting at home doing nothing,\" she says."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Free Clinics Fill Huge Gaps in US Health Care System", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/free-clinics-fill-huge-gaps-in-us-health-care-system-/4667726.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The most important issue for many U.S. voters in this month\u2019s midterm elections wasn\u2019t the economy.

The vast majority have type 2 diabetes, the kind linked to obesity and lack of exercise, and cases are spreading particularly rapidly in the developing world as people adopt more Western, urban lifestyles.\n\nResearchers said the amount of insulin needed to effectively treat type 2 diabetes would rise by more than 20 percent over the next 12 years, but insulin would be beyond the reach of half the 79 million type 2 diabetics predicted to need it in 2030. The shortfall is most acute in Africa, where the team led by Dr Sanjay Basu from Stanford University estimated supply would have to rise sevenfold to treat at-risk patients who had reached the stage of requiring insulin to control their blood sugar.\n\n\"These estimates suggest that current levels of insulin access are highly inadequate compared to projected need, particularly in Africa and Asia,\" Basu said.\n\n\u200b\"Despite the U.N.'s commitment to treat non-communicable diseases and ensure universal access to drugs for diabetes, across much of the world insulin is scarce and unnecessarily difficult for patients to access.\"\n\nGlobal insulin supply is dominated by three companies \u2014 Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Eli Lilly-- which have various programs to try to improve access to their products.\n\nInsulin, however, remains costly and prices can be especially out of reach in poorer countries where tortuous supply chains and high mark-ups by middlemen often make it unaffordable for many patients.\n\nOverall, Basu and colleagues calculated that global insulin use was set to rise to 634 million 1,000-unit vials by 2030 from 526 million in 2018.\n\nTheir study, published in the Lancet Diabetes; Endocrinology journal and funded by the Helmsley Charitable Trust, was based on projections of diabetes prevalence from the International Diabetes Federation.\n\nDr Hertzel Gerstein from Canada's McMaster University wrote in an accompanying commentary that it was important to estimate and ensure insulin supplies, but added the forecasts should be treated cautiously as they were based on mathematical models."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "U.S., Canada Warn About E.coli in Romaine Lettuce", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/u-s-canada-warn-about-e-coli-in-romaine-lettuce-/4667001.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Public health officials in the United States and Canada on Tuesday warned against eating romaine lettuce while they investigate an outbreak of E. coli that has sickened 50 people in the two countries, including 13 who were hospitalized.\n\nThe alerts, issued as millions of Americans plan their Thanksgiving Day menus, covered all forms of romaine, including whole heads, hearts, bags, mixes and Caesar salad.\n\nOfficials were uncertain of the source of the tainted lettuce.\n\n\"Consumers who have any type of romaine lettuce in their home should not eat it and should throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one has gotten sick,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said in its food safety alert.\n\nRefrigerator drawers and shelves where romaine lettuce had been stored should be sanitized, the CDC said.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada, which is investigating 18 of the E. coli cases, directed its romaine lettuce alert at consumers in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nIn the United States, the CDC said the outbreak affected 32 people in 11 states between Oct. 8 and Oct. 31.

Meanwhile, only 4 of 31 wild birds in a forest in the western town of Maricao survived, along with 75 out of 134 wild parrots living in the Rio Abajo forest in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, scientists said.\n\nAnd while several dozen new parrots have been born in captivity and in the wild since Maria, the species is still in danger, according to scientists.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Gustavo Olivieri, parrot recovery program coordinator for Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources.\n\nFederal and local scientists will meet next month to debate how best to revive a species that numbered more than 1 million in the 1800s but dwindled to 13 birds during the 1970s after decades of forest clearing.\n\nThe U.S. and Puerto Rican governments launched a program in 1972 that eventually led to the creation of three breeding centers. Just weeks before Maria hit, scientists reported 56 wild birds at El Yunque, the highest since the program was launched.\n\nBut the population decline is now especially worrisome because the parrots that vanished from El Yunque were some of the last remaining wild ones, said Marisel Lopez, who oversees the parrot recovery program at El Yunque for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\n\"It was devastating. After so many years of having worked on this project...,\" she stopped talking and sighed.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Amazon is Puerto Rico's only remaining native parrot and is one of roughly 30 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. The red-foreheaded birds grow to nearly a foot in length, are known for their secrecy and usually mate for life, reproducing once a year.\n\nMore than 460 birds remain captive at the breeding centers in El Yunque and Rio Abajo forests, but scientists have not released any of them since Hurricane Maria. A third breeding center in a forest in the western rural town of Maricao has not operated since the storm. Scientists are now trying to determine the best way to prepare the parrots for release since there are such few birds in the wild they can interact with, and whether Puerto Rico's damaged forests can sustain them.\n\nOne proposal scientists will consider is whether to capture some of the remaining wild parrots in the Rio Abajo forest and place them in the same cage as birds that will be released to the wild, so they can learn to emulate their social behavior to ensure their survival, said Jafet Velez, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\nScientists are tentatively planning to release 20 birds next year in Rio Abajo.\n\nAnother proposal is to release more parrots in Maricao, which was not as heavily damaged by Maria.\n\n\"Our priority now is not reproduction. ... it's to start releasing them,\" Lopez said, adding that breeding centers can hold only so many parrots.\n\nBut first, scientists need to make sure the forests can offer food and safe shelter.\n\nJessica Ilse, a forest biologist at el Yunque for the U.S. Forest Service, said scientists are collecting data about the amount of fruit falling from trees and the number of leaves shed. She said the canopy still has not grown back since Maria and warned that invasive species have taken root since more sunlight now shines through. Ilse said that many of the large trees where parrots used to nest are now gone and noted that it took 14 months for El Yunque's canopy to close after Hurricane Hugo hit Puerto Rico in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.\n\nScientists also are now collecting new data on the number of predators at El Yunque, including el guaraguao, a red-tailed hawk that hunts Puerto Rico parrots. Without a canopy and proper camouflage, wild parrots have become an easy target.\n\nIlse said local and federal scientists plan to help the forest recover through planting. By the end of November, they expect to have a map detailing the most damaged areas in El Yunque and a list of tree species they can plant that are more resistant to hurricanes.\n\n\"People keep asking us, 'How long is it going to take?'\" Ilse said.\n\nBut scientists don't know, she added.\n\n\"The damage is more extensive than [hurricanes] Hugo and Georges. ...

Questions these days aren't so much about whether she'll run for the Senate or even president, but whether she ought to keep her job at Facebook.\n\n\u201cHer brand was being manicured with the same resources and care as the gardens of Tokyo,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor. \u201cAnd unfortunately a hurricane has come through the garden.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been dealing with hurricanes for the past two years: fake news, elections interference, hate speech, a privacy scandal, the list goes on. The company's response \u2014 namely, Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's \u2014 has been slow at best, misleading and obfuscating at worst, as The New York Times reported last week. That report, and one from The Wall Street Journal , underscored Sandberg's influence at the company, even as Zuckerberg has borne much of the criticism and anger. There have been calls for both to be ousted.\n\nBut because of the way Facebook is set up, firing Zuckerberg would be all but impossible. He controls the majority of the company's voting stock, serves as its chairman and has \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 the support of its board of directors. Essentially, he'd have to fire himself. Firing Sandberg would be the next logical option to hold a high-level executive accountable. Though the chances are slim, the fact that it has even come up shows the extent of Facebook's \u2014 and Sandberg\u2019s \u2014 troubles.\n\nAs chief operating officer, Sandberg is in charge of Facebook's business dealings, including the ads that make up the bulk of the company's revenue. She steered Facebook from a rising tech startup into a viable global business expected to reap $55 billion in revenue this year. The company is second only to Google in digital advertising.\n\nBut she's also gotten the blame when things go wrong, including Facebook's failure to spot Russian attempts to influence U.S. elections by buying U.S. political ads \u2014 in rubles. Though Sandberg has denied knowing that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to discredit activists, she created a permissive environment through what the Times called an \u201caggressive lobbying campaign\u201d against critics. Facebook fired the firm, Definers, after the Times report came out.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Sandberg or make her available for an interview. A representative instead pointed to Zuckerberg's remarks that overall, \u201cSheryl is doing great work for the company. She's been a very important partner to me and continues to be, and will continue to be. She's leading a lot of the efforts to improve our systems in these areas.\u201d\n\nSandberg, 49, who was hired away from Google in 2008, has been a crucial \u201cheat shield\u201d for Zuckerberg, as Galloway put it, as lawmakers and the public crank up criticism of the 34-year-old founder. In September, Facebook sent Sandberg to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, eliciting a warmer response than her boss did three months before.\n\nSandberg, former chief of staff for treasury secretary Larry Summers, appears more comfortable in Washington meeting rooms than Zuckerberg, who can seem robotic. Her profile is high enough that lawmakers don't feel stilted when she shows up. She's written (with help) two books, including 2013's \u201cLean In\u201d about women and leadership. Her second book, \u201cPlan B,\u201d is about dealing with loss and grief after her husband died unexpectedly. She was the lone chief operating officer among a who's who of tech CEOs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 to meet with Donald Trump a month after his election.\n\n\u201cIt's both who she is and how bereft Silicon Valley is of strong, powerful female voices,\u201d crisis management expert Richard Levick said. \u201cShe has positioned herself as one of those strong voices with \u2018Lean In.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nBut her high profile also makes her more susceptible to criticism.\n\nThe chorus for Sandberg to leave is getting louder. CNBC commentator Jim Cramer predicted Monday that Facebook's stock would rise if Sandberg leaves or gets fired. NYU's Galloway believes both Sandberg and Zuckerberg should be fired for allowing Facebook to turn into an entity that harms democracy around the world.\n\n\u201cEvery day executives are fired for a fraction of infractions these two have committed,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides elections interference, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been criticized for their slow response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining firm accessed millions of users' private information without their permission. The pair were silent for days after the news came out.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Zuckerberg told Sandberg this spring that he blamed her and her teams for the \u201cpublic fallout\u201d over Cambridge Analytica. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Sandberg at one point wondered if she should be worried about her job (though that appears to no longer be the case, based on Zuckerberg's public support).\n\nGalloway said it would look bad for Facebook to fire one of the only top female executives in an industry where women \u201cface inordinately high obstacles to get to leadership positions.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Sandberg has also been a positive force on Facebook. She was hired to be the \u201cadult\u201d in the room and has filled that role well. She moves comfortably outside tech circles and in public speaking, countering Zuckerberg's shortcomings in that area.\n\nIf anything, Sandberg's departure from Facebook would likely be on her own terms. While Zuckerberg has spent all of his adult life at Facebook, Sandberg had a career before Facebook and even tech, so it is plausible that she would have a life after Facebook, perhaps back in politics.\n\nBut first, she has Facebook's own troubles to deal with. The task seems daunting because its problems might never go away. But Levick believes she can begin to restore her image by acknowledging her role in causing Facebook's problems instead of blaming external forces beyond her control: \u201cThe knee jerk response \u2018poor, poor\u2019 me\u2019 is not the solution.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Where Did North Korea\u2019s Cyber Army Come From?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-cyber-army/4666459.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "North Korean hackers continue to circumvent protections and compromise computer systems around the globe.

But without real-world trials, he says they can\u2019t obtain the knowledge needed to test systems or prevent hostile attacks.\n\n\u201cBasically, you should teach basic computer knowledge, and then try to solve some hacking problems,\u201d he said, adding that the best way to improve one\u2019s computer infiltration skills is with real-time and real-world practice.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea acquires [their] knowledge by invading other systems,\u201d said Kim.\n\nHe added that because North Korea can directly attack other countries, that effort has enabled Pyongyang to quickly develop their world-renowned hacking skills.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s cyber army\n\nExperts assert there are between 6,000 and 7,500 members of North Korea\u2019s cyber army, split into a number of divisions to carry out cyberterrorism against state infrastructure, financial institutions, and the latest hijacking of defense technology.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea was inspired by the Chinese cyberwar units and learned from them,\u201d said NK Intellectuals Solidarity director Heung Kwan Kim, \u201cRecognizing their power, North Korea set up the first unit within the central government in 1993.\u201d\n\nWhile Pyongyang\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau is comprised of six divisions and overseas operations in South Korea, the United States, and Japan, it\u2019s another bureau that is responsible for the bulk of North Korea\u2019s cyber warfare.\n\n\u201cUnit 121 oversees Unit 180, Unit 91, and lab 110,\u201d Heung Kwan Kim told VOA.\n\nA 500-person strong Unit 121 was created in 1998, and in 2009 the group successfully carried out 77 attacks by overwhelming computer networks through unleashing an onslaught of Internet traffic.\n\nThis led Pyongyang to conclude that cyber-warfare was \u201cthe most suitable form of war\u201d for North Korea in the modern era, according to Heung Kwan Kim.\n\nAttacks continued throughout 2014, and in 2015. When North Korea reorganized their divisions, Unit 121 was given the mission of attacking a foreign nation\u2019s infrastructure, such as transportation networks, telecommunications, gas, electric power, nuclear power, and aviation systems.\n\nUnit 91\u2019s focus was shifted to acquiring \u201cadvanced technologies needed for nuclear development and long-range missiles from developed countries.\u201d\n\nFinally, the role of Unit 180 was changed for it to target financial systems and to focus on block chain technology.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchains\n\nWith international sanctions crippling Pyongyang\u2019s coffers, Heung Kwan Kim said North Korea shifted their cyberattacks to private systems, rather than government networks, because the smaller entities weren\u2019t as well protected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem of North Korea\u2019s high ability and low security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe numerous attacks on small and private companies have led to allegations that Pyongyang is hacking into cryptocurrency exchanges to steal virtual money, like Bitcoin, said Seungjoo Kim. Stolen cryptocurrencies are attractive because they are difficult to trace back to their original owner.\n\nIn 2017, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus was accused of attacking South Korea cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. The cyber thieves made off with nearly $7 million in digital currencies.\n\nThe hackers also obtained personal information of users stored on the compromised servers. The BBC reports North Korea was later able to ransom additional funds from the owners in exchange for deleting the data.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is easy to steal because it moves in cyberspace,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo earn cryptocurrency in a legitimate way, cutting-edge computers are required, but North Korea doesn\u2019t have them, so they attack computers abroad and hack mining programs.\u201d\n\nThe hacked computers then send any virtual coins it uncovers to North Korean digital wallets they can convert to hard currency.\n\nTo curtail North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks, he advocates a detente in the virtual world that\u2019s similar to the easing of tensions taking place on the peninsula.

According to three separate testimonies obtained by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch, the torture included electric shock, whipping, sleep deprivation tactics and sexual misconduct including forcible kissing, touching and sexual assault.\n\nThe activists showed physical evidence of torture that included red marks on the body, uncontrollable shaking in the hands; some were unable to walk or even stand. One testimony alleged that a woman was hung from the ceiling for a long period of time, and at least one activist attempted suicide multiple times while detained. The activists were also reportedly kept in solitary confinement for at least several months.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported that it was \u201cunclear whether [Saudi officials] were seeking to force the women to sign confessions or merely to punish them for their peaceful advocacy.\u201d\n\nThe reports come just weeks after Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and resident of the U.S., disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.

They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some members of the Saudi royal family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king\u2019s death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nPrince Ahmed, King Salman\u2019s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.\n\nPrince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family\u2019s senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom\u2019s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA\u2019s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cvery premature\u201d but \u201cpossible,\u201d and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \u201cnothing else to add at this time\u201d.\n\nThe Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry \u201cfocus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\u201d and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. ROLE KEY\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi\u2019s security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \u201cwould not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\u201d because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\u201cThey (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \u201croll some heads to appease the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role \u2013 including one of MbS\u2019s closest aides.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi King Salman expressed support for his son, the crown prince, who is accused or orchestrating the slaying.\n\nALLEGIANCE COUNCIL\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman\u2019s wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi\u2019s killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Tamara O\u2019Neal Was Almost Erased From The Story Of Her Own Murder", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tamara-oneal-chicago-shooting-domestic-violence_us_5bf576a6e4b0771fb6b4ceef", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Chicago Tribune via Getty Images The mother of Tamara O'Neal holds a picture of her family, Nov. 20. O'Neal was fatally shot by her former fiance in Chicago the day before.\n\nTamara O\u2019Neal had just finished up her emergency room shift at Mercy Hospital in Chicago on Nov. 19 when Juan Lopez, her ex-fiance, materialized in the parking lot. He knew where to find her. Earlier in the day, he rang the hospital trying to get her on the phone. She told the clerk who took the call to tell him she was busy.\n\nAs recently as September, O\u2019Neal, 38, had planned to marry Lopez. But something caused her to change her mind, and a few weeks before the wedding, she broke off the engagement. On Monday the sight of him scared her enough to dial 911.\n\nIn the parking lot, he claimed to want his engagement ring back, but that was an excuse, another attempt to control her. He revealed his true intentions when he pulled out his gun and shot her six times. Afterward, he ran into the hospital and kept shooting, killing Dayna Less, a 24-year-old pharmacy resident, and Samuel Jimenez, 28, a rookie officer with the Chicago Police Department, before being killed by officer gunfire.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, when the facts were still being sorted, the media latched onto the policeman who was killed in the line of duty. His death \u2015 understood as the most newsworthy component of the incident \u2015 became the story. Headlines, captions and mobile alerts (including HuffPost\u2019s), focused on him. In The New York Times, for example, O\u2019Neal was not named until the fifth paragraph, as one of the \u201cother victims,\u201d and her relationship to the shooter wasn\u2019t explained until later in the story.\n\nSomehow, a mass shooting rooted in gendered violence was framed as a random act. Even Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a news conference said the mass shooting was \u201cthe consequence of evil.\u201d\n\nBut the shooting was not random at all. It was the consequence of domestic violence. And by relegating O\u2019Neal to a supporting part in the story, the media fundamentally misrepresented the nature of the attack. The massacre was a result of her ex-partner\u2019s final attempt to control her.\n\n\u201cWe are not connecting the dots correctly,\u201d said Monica McLaughlin, the director of public policy at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n\nThe erasure of O\u2019Neal from the narrative obscures the motivation behind the attack, McLaughlin added, making it harder for the public to recognize the undercurrent of toxic masculinity in American gun violence.\n\nMonte Gerlach Photography via AP Tamara O'Neal in September 2017. Although her killing was the consequence of domestic violence, many news outlets at first minimized her in their reports about a mass shooting.\n\n\u201cViolence against women is a common denominator in many, many, many of these shootings,\u201d she said.\n\nAs HuffPost has reported, most mass shootings in the U.S. involve a man targeting his intimate partner or another family member. And among mass shooters who target the public in random acts of violence, many have histories of abusive behavior toward women. (See: Pulse, Parkland, Sutherland Springs.)\n\nDavid Adams, a domestic violence expert who has studied men who kill their partners, said many homicidal abusers feel a sense of ownership over their wife or girlfriend.\n\n\u201cThey blame their partners for their own problems and, in general, see themselves as victims of unappreciative, selfish partners,\u201d he said. Men who kill their partners as part of a mass shooting may simply want a larger audience to advertise their grievances, he added.\n\nLike many mass shooters before him, Lopez had a history of abusive behavior toward women. He was fired from the Chicago Fire Academy in 2014 after he was accused of inappropriate conduct with female cadets. The same year, his then-wife filed an emergency protective order against him. \u201cI fear that my safety is in jeopardy,\u201d she wrote, stating that he was acting erratically with his firearm and had threatened to go to her job and cause a scene.\n\nFour years later, he followed through on his threat to cause a scene at a workplace, only this time it was to confront O\u2019Neal. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d her father, Tom O\u2019Neal, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t let go and he took her away from us.\u201d\n\nRuth Glenn, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said she understood the gut instinct among media outlets to emphasize the police officer\u2019s death. Unfortunately, when it comes to gun violence, there is a hierarchy of newsworthiness. A police officer killed in the line of duty makes headlines far more often than a woman slain by her intimate partner. Especially, Glenn said, if she is a woman of color.\n\n\u201c[Police officers] put their lives on the line every day,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you think about it, so does a victim when she has decided that she needs to be away from the violence.\u201d\n\nA mass shooting rooted in gendered violence was framed as a random act.\n\nWomen are at the highest risk of being killed when they leave their partners, said Maureen Curtis, the vice president of criminal justice programs for the nonprofit group Safe Horizon. For many women, their workplaces can become a place of heightened danger, as their partners know when and where they work.\n\nIn 2017, Karen Elaine Smith was teaching an elementary class in San Bernardino, California, when her husband, whom she had recently left, walked in with a handgun and began shooting, killing her and an 8-year-old student.\n\n\u201cThis is one reason why we need to recognize that domestic violence is not just a personal matter and that helping and supporting a victim not only can save her life but the lives of others,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nErasing domestic violence from the story also does a disservice to the police officer slain, said Mark Wynn, a retired Tennessee officer who now travels the country training police on issues related to violence against women.\n\nCalls related to domestic disputes are the most dangerous for police, he said. In a strange coincidence, Wynn was just a few miles from Mercy Hospital, training Chicago police officers how to respond to domestic violence incidents, with a focus on officer safety, when the shooting happened."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Massive 14-Year Oil Spill Ordered To Be Cleaned As Leaks Continue", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oil-spill-ordered-to-be-cleaned_us_5bf557d5e4b0771fb6b47f5d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "A massive oil spill that\u2019s feared to become the largest marine disaster of its kind in the nation\u2019s history is receiving attention from the U.S. Coast Guard after steadily leaking off Louisiana\u2019s coast for more than 14 years.\n\nThe military branch has ordered Taylor Energy Company to \u201ccapture, contain or remove oil\u201d from the toxic site located 13 miles from the mouth of Mississippi River or face a $40,000 per day fine, The Washington Post reported.\n\nSince the company\u2019s oil platform was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, the Justice Department estimates that it leaks up to 29,400 gallons, or 700 barrels, of oil per day, which would equate to roughly 150 million gallons total.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS An oil sheen from the site of the former Taylor Energy oil rig is seen in the wake of a supply vessel off the coast of Louisiana in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe worst-case estimate of the daily volume of release far exceeds previous estimates and is in the order of hundreds of barrels per day,\u201d the Coast Guard told Taylor Energy in a letter obtained by The Times-Picayune.\n\nTaylor Energy has disputed that amount, claiming that at the most it leaks 55 barrels per day.\n\nThe Coast Guard\u2019s order follows a number of environmental groups demanding more attention for the spill that is now feared to rival the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that leaked roughly 200 million gallons of crude oil in what was then a record-setting disaster.\n\nThe Coast Guard\u2019s order also follows an investigation by The Associated Press in 2015 that revealed that the amount of oil leaking from the Taylor Energy site is significantly higher than claimed.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The oil sheen from the former Taylor Energy oil rig site, pictured here in 2015, has reached up to 30 miles in length.\n\nSatellite imagery taken over the Gulf Coast has since captured oil slicks in the area ranging up to 30 miles in length, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nScientists employed by Taylor Energy have argued that the oil sheens are caused by oil and gas that is on the oil-saturated seafloor, and not from its wells, The Times-Picayune reported.\n\n\u201cTaylor Energy\u2019s greater concern is that the government is leading the response down a dangerous path that will create an environmental impact that currently does not exist,\u201d a Taylor spokesperson told The Washington Post. \u201cIf there were anything legally permissible and effective that Taylor Energy could do in an environmentally responsible manner to stop the sheen, we would have already done it.\u201d\n\nTaylor Energy, which the AP reported sold all its offshore leases and oil and gas interests in 2008, had been ordered to create a $666 million trust to cover the costs of the cleanup.

While it\u2019s easy to blame it on your last viewing of \u201cThe Shining\u201d or some other terrifying film, the true culprits of our nightmares are the seemingly mundane activities we do every day.\n\nNightmares are different from regular not-so-great dreams because they wake us up suddenly, often during the early hours when we\u2019re well into our rapid eye movement sleep. Nightmares are also not to be confused with night terrors, which typically happen soon after we fall asleep, and which feel very real \u2015 so waking up feels even more terrifying.\n\nNightmares are more common among children than adults, but that doesn\u2019t mean adults don\u2019t experience them. An estimated 50 percent of adults have occasional nightmares, according to psychology experts. Women have them more frequently than men.\n\n\u201cIn general, nightmares aren\u2019t a threat to sleep quality or health,\u201d said Ginger Houghton, a licensed clinical social worker and owner of Bright Spot Counseling in Michigan. \u201cHowever, if the nightmares are consistent and severe enough that a person struggles at work, home or school or if they want to avoid sleep, it\u2019s time to find a board-certified sleep medicine doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the nightmares are consistent and severe enough that a person struggles at work, home or school or if they want to avoid sleep, it\u2019s time to find a board-certified sleep medicine doctor.\u201d - Ginger Houghton, licensed clinical social worker\n\nChances are good this doesn\u2019t describe you: Only about 1 percent of adults have nightmares frequent enough that they need to seek professional help. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should just brush off your bad dream. Dina Merhbi, a registered dietitian in Montreal and founder of the Body Balance Method, said that even one nightmare can increase your fatigue, which may lead to unhealthy habits the next day.\n\n\u201cSleep is a time for the body to relax and reboot for the next day,\u201d Merhbi said. \u201cHowever, nightmares cause a high anxiety state that actually prevents the body from relaxing, and will cause changes in the next day like increased fatigue, heightened senses, [and] increased caffeine and sugar intake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long term,\u201d she said, \u201cwith recurrent nightmares, this will impact the energy and mental health of the person and might become a catalyst for depression, anxiety and even health issues such as glucose intolerance and high blood pressure.\u201d\n\nAnd while the link is not fully understood, experts have found a connection between frequent nightmares and mental health problems. Studies have found that people experiencing regular nightmares are at a higher risk of self-harm and suicide.\n\nSo how do you get control over your nightmares? One way is to look at what could be contributing to them. Below are a few things that could be adding to the problem, according to experts:\n\nYou\u2019re dealing with mental health problems.\n\nLuis Alvarez via Getty Images\n\nAccording to John Mayer, a clinical psychologist practicing in Chicago, negative thinking and unresolved issues play a huge role in determining what kind of nightmares, and how many of them, you might have.\n\n\u201cOur brains work like a computer; what goes in equals what comes out,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cSo, if you go to bed with negative thoughts or you\u2019re replaying negatives from your day, boom! Your brain is going to be loaded with negative thoughts to recycle while you sleep.\u201d\n\nOne Finnish study found that people who have severe depression or even just a negative self-attitude were likely to have more nightmares. In fact, 28 percent of their participants who had severe depression also reported having frequent nightmares.\n\nWhile depression is definitely a factor, general stress from everyday life can also have a significant impact on bad dreams and sleep quality. Common circumstances, such as moving, having an upcoming test or changing roles at work, can trigger a nightmare. Grief and other serious issues can also increase your risk.\n\n\u201cStress, unresolved conflicts and personal tragedies all contribute toward generating nightmares,\u201d said Damian Sendler, a clinician who specializes in treating patients with psychological and psychiatric conditions in New York. \u201cNightmares are \u2014 in a way \u2014 the pimples of our imagination. Just as with pimples that show up after there is an excessive accumulation of dirt and bacteria in the skin, nightmares are the byproduct of the mind corrupted by troubles and worries.\u201d\n\nYou have certain personality traits.\n\nSome research has indicated that character traits may contribute to bad dreams. A 2001 study looked at people who were experiencing around two nightmares a month and found that those who are more sensitive are more likely to have frequent bad dreams. Another study discovered that people with artistic and creative interests are also more likely to experience nightmares on a regular basis.\n\nAustrian-American psychoanalyst and sleep researcher Ernest Hartmann found that people with thinner personality boundaries \u2014 those who are open-minded, sensitive and creative \u2014 are more likely to have longer, vivid, detailed and emotional dreams. And that dream content usually \u201cshowed a trend towards correlation with aggressive interaction and nightmare-likeness.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re processing a trauma.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, nightmares are a major symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. This can make it difficult to fall asleep again, which can in turn make the whole next day more challenging.\n\n\u201cSome people wake with a sad or scared feeling after nightmares, which can be a difficult start to the day,\u201d said Alex Dimitriu, a physician and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine. \u201cIf this occurs rarely, it is quite normal. However, regular frequent nightmares can be a sign of either some repressed memory, trauma, or possibly sleep apnea or sleep disturbance.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople with PTSD are most commonly known to experience recurring nightmares, often around the traumatic event,\u201d Dimitriu said. \u201cIn these instances, we always advise seeking professional help.\u201d\n\nYou ate before bed.\n\nAJ_Watt via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s pretty well understood that late-night snacking isn\u2019t the best thing for your health, but you might not realize it could be the source of your nightmares. Eating a big meal, or even just a snack, increases your metabolism and body temperature. This causes your brain to be more active, and thus could lead to more nightmares.\n\nA 2015 study by the University of Montreal found that 9.5 percent of people had bad dreams after indulging in a late-night meal. Another 2015 study surveyed almost 400 students and had them keep a record of their dreams, and of what they ate, for two weeks. About 44 percent of people reported that ice cream and other dairy products caused bizarre and disturbing dreams. And there\u2019s even some evidence to suggest spicy foods can lead to nightmares.\n\nYou had a nightcap.\n\nWhile drinking alcohol might initially help you fall asleep, your night is going to be anything but restful. At some point, the alcohol metabolizes and the sedative effect wears off, creating fragmented sleep and nightmares, according to the Cleveland Clinic. And thanks to that vodka tonic, your dreams and nightmares will be way more vivid than usual. There\u2019s even a chance you\u2019ll \u201cact out\u201d your dreams or sleepwalk.\n\nYour medication is messing with your sleep.\n\nCertain drugs may also affect nightmares. According to the Mayo Clinic, blood pressure medications, antidepressants, antihistamines (found in sleep aids and allergy medicines) and steroids are some of the typical offenders. Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and cholesterol-lowering medications can also contribute to disturbed sleep and bad dreams.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the 1 to 5 percent of people who take these medications and have nightmares \u2015 and it\u2019s affecting your quality of life \u2015 check in with your doctor.\n\nHow can you prevent nightmares?\n\nAdene Sanchez via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to treating any mental health issues, watching your eating habits before bed and talking to your doctor about medication intake, there are a few things you can do to make sure you get a good nightmare-free sleep. Healthy lifestyle habits like meditation, therapy, exercise and journaling can help improve sleep, which in turn may help with your nightmares.\n\nAlex Tran, a wellness expert and yoga teacher in California, said that meditation helped her clear negative thought patterns from her abusive childhood that she believed were contributing to her frequent nightmares.\n\n\u201cI grew up having nightmares two to three times a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI found yoga in my early 20s, and the physical practice introduced me to the meditative practice. This has allowed me to clear my thoughts while drifting into sleep, get rid of my nightmares and enjoy a peaceful sleep.\u201d\n\nBecause nightmares can sometimes be a sign of an unresolved issue or conflict in your life, Dara Bushman, a licensed clinical psychologist practicing in South Florida, said acknowledging the problem before you fall asleep could also help with prevention.\n\n\u201cFrequent nightmares are often the result of the mind processing a prior event,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mind does not respond to \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 think of something. In fact, when you drive by a car accident, and someone tells you not to look, the first thing someone does is look. You can prevent nightmares by thinking of the uncomfortable stimulus.\u201d\n\nDream expert and author Lauri Loewenberg suggests that nightmares are not something to be feared. Rather, they\u2019re a tool to help you manage and assess your overall well-being.\n\n\u201cThe occasional nightmare may keep you from being able to fall back asleep and have you a bit upset the following day but is typically not harmful,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it can be very good for you because it is the subconscious alerting you to something that is wrong in your life [like] a difficult, ignored or mishandled issue that needs attention and correction.\u201d\n\nSo next time you find yourself jolted awake after being chased by a monster in your sleep, ask yourself what that monster might represent. It could be the first step to put it \u2014 and the rest of your nightmares \u2014 away for good."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "What To Know About The Romaine E.

The reported E. coli infections began between Oct. 8 and Oct. 31, but officials said there may be even more because it takes an average of two to three weeks for illnesses to be reported.\n\nNo deaths have been reported, although 13 of those affected were sick enough to be hospitalized and one person developed kidney failure.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the outbreak:\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with romaine lettuce, exactly?\n\nThe CDC is still investigating, but the agency announced that E. coli O157:H7, a strain of E. coli that produces a harmful toxin, has been linked to romaine lettuce.\n\nThe bacterial strain comes from cow feces and was first recognized as a pathogen in 1982. It contaminates the human food supply several ways, such as through unsanitary irrigation or spraying, flooding, or animals who carry the bacteria onto farmland. A 2006 E. coli outbreak linked to spinach \u2015 which sickened hundreds \u2015 was caused by wild pigs wandering between cow pastures and spinach fields in California.\n\nHow do I know if I\u2019m infected?\n\nPeople who become sick with E. coli experience stomach cramps or pains, mild to severe diarrhea, and sometimes nausea or vomiting.\n\nA fraction of those affected \u2015 5 to 10 percent \u2015 also experience kidney failure, or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms include a lower frequency of urination, feeling very tired and losing the pink color in your cheeks, the CDC says.\n\nMost people begin feeling sick three to four days after eating or drinking something that has the bacteria in it, although illness can begin anywhere from one to 10 days after consuming the contaminated food.\n\nUsually, symptoms clear up within five to seven days, but the most severe cases can lead to death.\n\nI think I have an E. coli infection. What do I do?\n\nCall your doctor, who may ask you to confirm the diagnosis with a stool sample. You are also asked to report your illness to state health departments, which in turn report to the CDC. A list of state health departments can be found here.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Romaine lettuce at a California grocery store. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends you throw away any romaine lettuce you have.\n\nWhat should I do with the romaine lettuce I have?\n\nThrow it away, the CDC said, even if people in your household have eaten some of it and no one seems to be sick. Baby romaine, spring mixes and Caesar salad mixes could all be affected, too.\n\nDon\u2019t order it at a restaurant, either, although restaurants have already been advised not to serve romaine or any lettuce mix containing romaine.\n\nThe CDC also recommends sanitizing your refrigerator by removing all the food, washing and drying removable parts, and cleaning the interior. A guide can be found here.\n\nWhere did the outbreak start?\n\nOfficials aren\u2019t sure yet. That\u2019s why the warning covers romaine all over the country.\n\nWhen can I eat romaine again?\n\nThe CDC has yet to identify any grower, supplier, distributor or brand of romaine lettuce common between those infected.

It\u2019s for that reason I must speak out against acting Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler\u2019s pending proposal, misleadingly named the \u201cAffordable Clean Energy Rule,\u201d to dismantle the Obama-era 2015 Clean Power Plan, which set the first and only federal limits on carbon pollution from power plants.\n\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand how air pollution harms our communities\u2019 most vulnerable populations. During my pediatrics rotation last year, half of the patients on our ward were young children with asthma from Chicago\u2019s South Side. Some of these kids had been to the hospital so many times they\u2019d lost track, rushed by their parents into the emergency room when they could barely breathe.\n\nWe were thankfully able to successfully treat these children, but their terrifying experiences left a lasting impression on me, and I continue to be deeply troubled by the knowledge that a large number of my cases could\u2019ve been prevented if these kids only had cleaner air to breathe. Study after study has shown the connection between dirty air and asthma exacerbations and that improving air quality has a clear and positive impact on children\u2019s health.\n\nDuring my pediatrics rotation last year, half of the patients on our ward were young children with asthma from Chicago\u2019s South Side. Some of these kids had been to the hospital so many times they\u2019d lost track.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s proposed ACE Rule doesn\u2019t set limits on how many tons of carbon existing coal-fired power plants can emit. Emission standards, set by individual states, would instead be based on making coal-fired power plants somewhat more efficient without specifying any actual emissions targets. This rule will consequently fail to achieve any meaningful reduction in the amount of pollution coming from these power plants. In fact, it could actually increase total pollution if coal-fired power plants that improve their efficiency were to run more frequently.\n\nUltimately, the EPA plans to allow old, failing coal plants that should be shut down entirely to continue operating, thus emitting more dangerous carbon pollution into our air. And this will disproportionately harm the more than 26 million Americans with asthma \u2013 including 6 million children. Indeed, the EPA\u2019s own analysis of its own rule concluded ACE could result in up to 1,400 more premature deaths, 48,000 more asthma exacerbations and at least 21,000 missed days of school annually by 2030. And the EPA doesn\u2019t even attempt to address this discrepancy.\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler testifies before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Aug. 1, 2018.\n\nOne of the very first lessons a medical student learns when you get your white coat is the Hippocratic oath, which includes the promise to \u201cdo no harm.\u201d And while Wheeler isn\u2019t a doctor, the agency he heads similarly states that its mission is \u201cto protect human health and the environment\u201d \u2013 a mission that\u2019s explicitly undermined by this new proposed rule.\n\nWhen children come into the emergency room in the midst of a severe asthma attack, the scene is uniformly terrifying: chests heaving, eyes bulging and tiny neck muscles straining, all to get just an ounce more air into their lungs. The ACE Rule will ensure these events don\u2019t just continue to happen but that they will increase, and it will be up to those of us in the medical profession to mitigate the EPA\u2019s mistakes. But doctors aren\u2019t perfect, and we will inevitably fail at some point to reopen a child\u2019s airway. The death of even one additional child due to this ill-informed policy will be not just a tragedy but a callous and preventable crime.\n\nThe EPA is currently reviewing comments submitted on its proposal. The timing for a final, official rule is uncertain, but will most likely come in mid- or late 2019. I implore the EPA to carefully review the input provided by groups like Physicians for Social Responsibility and the American Lung Association.\n\nThe death of even one additional child due to this ill-informed policy will be not just a tragedy but a callous and preventable crime.\n\nACE is neither clean nor affordable. It will increase rather than decrease the amount of pollutants in the air \u2015 pollutants that will inevitably lead to greater adverse health effects and their attendant costs. And it will only exacerbate climate change, slow the transition to cleaner, safer energy sources, and cost thousands of lives.\n\nAs the federal government attempts to undermine our critical environmental and health laws, we can and must take action at the state and local level, pushing leaders to fill the void by putting strong climate and clean energy policies in place so we can finally get a handle on the growing climate emergency.\n\nThe American people deserve an EPA that is focused on its stated mission, and that starts with Wheeler and the Trump administration strengthening lifesaving health and climate protections like the Clean Power Plan, not gutting them.

It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions.\n\nHere is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place!\n\nWell, indeed it is! But not so dangerous, perhaps, that one should expect to be assassinated in a consulate while going to collect paperwork for a wedding.\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more.\n\nMr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nLikewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has created the worst famine the country has seen. Despite calls from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a cease-fire, Saudi Arabia has stepped up its military operations. The Saudi military\u2019s lack of discipline and planning in its airstrikes has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, according to American officials. Regional experts say the Trump administration\u2019s most decisive action against Saudi Arabia so far has been to cut off aerial refueling flights for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\n\nThis is a prime example of Mr. Trump\u2019s brutally transactional foreign policy. He is supporting Saudi Arabia because he thinks it is critical for the United States\u2019 defense industry. Saudi Arabia spends huge amounts on its military, and the United States is a beneficiary. However, the president\u2019s numbers are exaggerated. Trouble in the Saudi economy has led the government to slow roll some of the pledges to buy high-ticket items, including the missile defense system known as Thaad.\n\nIf we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nBaloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States.\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nHere, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime.\n\nMr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded.\n\nKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nWho knows! Can we ever really know what happened behind closed doors? Mr. Trump is clearly waiting for the kind of evidence shown on television: a recording of the crown prince giving the order or a confession of one of the kill team members. But former intelligence officers say that is not how it works. The puzzle pieces are never all present. Even without the smoking gun, enough evidence has emerged for C.I.A. officials to conclude that Prince Mohammed gave the order, according to current and former officials.\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nRemember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed.\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.\n\nOther presidents have often shied away from talking about what lies at the heart of the strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil production and low gas prices. Not Mr. Trump. And, surprising as it may seem, he is correct about the United States being the world\u2019s largest oil producer.\n\nAs President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\nIn 1979, William Safire, the New York Times columnist and former presidential speechwriter, offered readers of this newspaper some sage advice: \u201cDon\u2019t overuse exclamation marks!!!\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Wanted to Order Justice Dept. to Prosecute Comey and Clinton", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/politics/president-trump-justice-department.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B.

Mr. Whitaker became acting attorney general this month after Mr. Sessions was forced out.\n\nThe group provided the overwhelming majority of his income since at least 2016, according to the filings released Tuesday by the Justice Department."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "In Extraordinary Statement, Trump Stands With Saudis Despite Khashoggi Killing", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-khashoggi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump defied the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and a growing body of evidence on Tuesday to declare his unswerving loyalty to Saudi Arabia, asserting that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s culpability for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi might never be known.\n\nIn a remarkable statement that appeared calculated to end the debate over the American response to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, the president said, \u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nHis statement, which aides said Mr. Trump dictated himself and reflected his deeply held views, came only days after the C.I.A. concluded that the crown prince, a close ally of the White House, had authorized the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and columnist for The Washington Post."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "Interpol Rejects Russian as President, Electing South Korean Instead", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/world/europe/interpol-russia-south-korea.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 19:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "Interpol\u2019s tepid response to that highly unusual action sparked criticism that it was too quick to yield to influence from an authoritarian government.

It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions.\n\nHere is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place!\n\nWell, indeed it is! But not so dangerous, perhaps, that one should expect to be assassinated in a consulate while going to collect paperwork for a wedding.\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more.\n\nMr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nLikewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has created the worst famine the country has seen. Despite calls from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a cease-fire, Saudi Arabia has stepped up its military operations. The Saudi military\u2019s lack of discipline and planning in its airstrikes has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, according to American officials. Regional experts say the Trump administration\u2019s most decisive action against Saudi Arabia so far has been to cut off aerial refueling flights for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\n\nThis is a prime example of Mr. Trump\u2019s brutally transactional foreign policy. He is supporting Saudi Arabia because he thinks it is critical for the United States\u2019 defense industry. Saudi Arabia spends huge amounts on its military, and the United States is a beneficiary. However, the president\u2019s numbers are exaggerated. Trouble in the Saudi economy has led the government to slow roll some of the pledges to buy high-ticket items, including the missile defense system known as Thaad.\n\nIf we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nBaloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States.\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nHere, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime.\n\nMr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded.\n\nKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nWho knows! Can we ever really know what happened behind closed doors? Mr. Trump is clearly waiting for the kind of evidence shown on television: a recording of the crown prince giving the order or a confession of one of the kill team members. But former intelligence officers say that is not how it works. The puzzle pieces are never all present. Even without the smoking gun, enough evidence has emerged for C.I.A. officials to conclude that Prince Mohammed gave the order, according to current and former officials.\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nRemember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed.\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.\n\nOther presidents have often shied away from talking about what lies at the heart of the strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil production and low gas prices. Not Mr. Trump. And, surprising as it may seem, he is correct about the United States being the world\u2019s largest oil producer.\n\nAs President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm.

The letter was an unmistakable message to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California that she may not have the votes to reclaim the speakership she lost in 2011.\n\nTheir ideological leanings and political profiles are diffuse \u2014 certainly not the Democratic equivalent of the Freedom Caucus, the group of ultraconservative Republicans that often acts as a thorn in the side of G.O.P. leadership. What the group shares is a determination to shake up the top echelons of the House Democratic Caucus, whose leaders have remained unchanged for more than a decade, with Ms. Pelosi, 78, at the helm; Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, 79, as the No. 2, and Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, 78, as the third ranking.\n\nSo far, no lawmaker has been willing to come forward to challenge any of them directly, and the list of signatories to the letter is limited, representing fewer than 10 percent of House Democrats. In fact, their ranks may be shrinking as Ms. Pelosi pulls them to her one at a time.

He recruited obese people to stay at the hospital and subsist on a 600-calorie a day liquid diet until they reached a normal weight.\n\nThe subjects lost 100 pounds on average, and they were thrilled. But as soon as they left the hospital, the pounds piled back on.\n\nDr. Hirsch and Dr. Rudy Leibel, now at Columbia University, repeated the study again and again, with the same result. Eventually, they found that when a very fat person diets down to a normal weight, he or she physiologically comes to resemble a starving person, craving food with an avidity that is hard to imagine.\n\nThe lesson never really penetrated the popular consciousness.
