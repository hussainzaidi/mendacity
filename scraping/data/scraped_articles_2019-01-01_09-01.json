The temporary measure would maintain the current $1.3 billion in border security money, which can be used for fencing and repairs of current barriers.\n\n\"The President is using the government shutdown to try to force an expensive and ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown,\" incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday in a statement.\n\nYet as the shutdown moves through its 10th day, it is clear that the House Democrats' plan to take the first legislative action since the start of the shuttering of roughly a quarter of the federal government remains a nonstarter for Republicans, who still control the chamber on the other side of the US Capitol.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has made clear he will not move forward on any legislation until President Donald Trump signs off on it. Trump, for his part, hasn't wavered on his position that the fight is something he'd promised during the campaign -- and one he was telling advisers and friends he was willing to continue.\n\n\"I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall,\" Trump tweeted Monday.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Monday, Trump said that he was ready to end the shutdown.\n\n\"I'm here, I'm ready to go. It's very important,\" he told Fox News' Pete Segseth. \"A lot of people are looking to get their paycheck, and so I'm ready to go anytime they want.\"\n\n\"No, we are not giving up,\" Trump added. \"We have to have border security and the wall is a big part of border security, the biggest part.\"\n\nOne of the President's closest allies, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the House Democratic proposal \"doesn't represent a serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise.\"\n\nMeadows, who speaks frequently with the President by phone, called the proposal \"a nonstarter\" and said it \"will not be a legitimate answer to this impasse.\"\n\nPelosi and Schumer, citing the bipartisan nature of the full-year funding measures and the unanimous Senate support before the partial shutdown of a stopgap bill to fund the government to February 8, attempted to ramp up the rhetorical pressure on Republicans in advance of the House votes. They said Senate Republicans would be \"complicit with President Trump\" in continuing the shutdown if they choose not to move forward with the House Democratic plan.\n\n\"It would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,\" the Democratic leaders said.\n\nDemocratic leaders mulled several proposals to re-open the government over the course of the last week before deciding to move forward with the full funding package. The move by House Democrats, however, is seen by Democratic aides as having the effect of jamming Senate Republicans and the White House as talks for a compromise agreement to reopen the government remain at an impasse.\n\nSenate Democrats support the House Democratic plan, and Schumer, D-New York, and Pelosi, D-California, have been in constant contact and are on the same page on the plan, a senior Senate Democratic aide said. Democratic appropriators and leaders discussed the idea with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, who urged them to move forward with the bipartisan Senate-approved measures.\n\nDemocrats believe it's smart to separate Department of Homeland Security funding -- and the wall fight -- from the other six bills because they think it puts Trump and the Republicans in the position of holding the other agencies and furloughed workers hostage for the wall, the aide said. Democrats believe pressure will mount on Republicans as the shutdown drags on, the aide said.\n\nThe negotiations on a deal to open the government have sat frozen for days, according to people involved, as lawmakers in the House and Senate have deserted the Capitol for the holidays and, with no votes scheduled, likely won't return until the start of the next Congress. That, according to several aides involved in the process, has been viewed as the unofficial moment talks may begin, but there still remains no clear pathway forward for an agreement.\n\nFor that to occur, aides in both parties acknowledge, one side is going to have to move off of positions they've proclaimed to be exceedingly comfortable in holding.\n\nFor Democrats, that means they will not put anything on the table beyond the current $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nFor the White House, the final position is more ambiguous: Vice President Mike Pence put a proposal for $2.5 billion for a combination border security and immigration priority funding on the table last week, but was rebuffed by Schumer. For his part, the President hasn't publicly endorsed that proposal or any other beyond his initial request for $5 billion.\n\nBut Trump has made clear, repeatedly on both Twitter and in private conversations, that he isn't backing down on a fight that has support from his base, top allies in the House Republican conference and top supporters in conservative commentary circles.\n\nTo some degree, both Democratic and Republican aides on Capitol Hill say, that has left them with little idea of what the President would actually support in a final deal.\n\n\"No idea,\" one senior GOP aide said. \"We just need to let this play out a bit more at this point.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump freezes federal workers' pay in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/6A5_2So5CAU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump issued an executive order Friday freezing federal workers' pay for 2019, following through on a proposal he announced earlier in the year.\n\nThe move, which nixes a 2.1% across-the-board pay raise that was set to take effect in January, comes as hundreds of thousands of federal employees are expecting to begin the new year furloughed or working without pay because of a partial government shutdown.\n\nTrump told lawmakers he planned to scrap the 2019 pay bump for federal workers in August, saying the federal budget couldn't support it.

Progressives are pushing for a \"Green New Deal\" -- a comprehensive package that would reimagine the US economy and the government's place in it -- that has been met with skepticism, and a few notes of hostility, by party centrists. Other fights are brewing over raising the national minimum wage, trade and Middle East policy.\n\nThese internal disputes will play out on two stages over the coming year -- the floor of the newly Democratic-controlled House, and in the 2020 primary debates, which begin in June\n\nParty angst over how to beat Trump in 2020 will fuel these fights, with establishment forces worried about alienating the suburban moderates who powered the party's 2018 wave while the insurgent progressives make the case that only bold new initiatives can renew -- and turn out -- its working class base.\n\nHere is a look ahead at some of the debates that will animate the coming year.\n\nGetting real about 'Medicare for all'\n\n\"Medicare for all,\" a form of single-payer health care, is the party's most popular big-ticket proposal for delivering on its promise of universal health care -- a solution to the ongoing challenges facing the Affordable Care Act that even former President Barack Obama seemed to endorse in a speech this past fall\n\nLawmakers and liberal think tanks began to sketch out the narrower terms of the debate in 2018, rolling out a variety of plans that would either chart a path to universal government-backed care or expand coverage by allowing Americans to \"buy in\" to programs like Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nThe push for a \"buy in\" offer, which would effectively create some form of the \"public option\" scuppered by Congressional Democrats during the Obamacare negotiations in 2009, was given a boost during the party's leadership scramble after New York Rep. Brian Higgins, secured an assurance last month from Nancy Pelosi to prioritize a plan to allow people 50 and older to buy into Medicare.\n\nBut with Democrats still in the Senate minority and shut out of the White House, proponents of more comprehensive reform are unlikely to accept compromise terms.\n\nLast year, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a likely 2020 candidate who caucuses with the Democrats, secured 16 cosponsors to his latest and most detailed legislation, which introduced a four-year plan for gradually moving millions of Americans onto the rolls of a beefed-up version of Medicare.\n\nAt least five of the names on the bill, in addition to Sanders', are considering runs in 2020 -- New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who helped write the transition plan, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley.\n\n\"There's going to be a question if any of those (other potential presidential candidates) take power: Do they actually want to create a single-payer program or is it just a messaging strategy to win people over with big ideas?,\" Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the progressive group Justice Democrats, told CNN. \"Do they support the end of private health insurance in the United States of America. Because that is what the bill is proposing to do. We're going to get way more into the specifics than we did in 2016.\"\n\nRaising worker wages\n\nSince Democrats last held the House in 2010, a movement for higher minimum wages has swept through the states, making $15 an hour the new benchmark for a livable income. A bill to move the national minimum wage to that level by 2024 is on the Democratic to-do list \u2014 but already, some on the left think that's too timid.\n\nThe proposals attracting the most attention, if not votes, are those that super-size the federal safety net and provide a public option for employment meant to raise wages by creating more competition for workers.\n\nHarris' LIFT Act would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to so many people that it resembles a \"universal basic income,\" an idea that has gained momentum over the past year. Alternatively, Sanders and Gillibrand have proposed a federal \"job guarantee,\" which would provide employment on public works projects to whomever wants to work.\n\nBut the bulk of the caucus probably won't go that far. Members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition are coalescing behind a proposal from Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell that would create regional minimum wages pegged to the variable costs of living, from midtown Manhattan to Beckley, West Virginia. According to a framework devised by the centrist think tank Third Way, wage floors would range from $9.80 in the cheapest places to $13.25 in the most expensive.\n\nThe debate is playing out against a difference of opinion around the root causes of stagnant wage growth.\n\nCentrists see the problem as a failure to help workers adapt to the trends of automation and globalization, which demands fixes such as more job training, apprenticeships, and vocational programs to equip them for high-demand careers like nursing, advanced manufacturing, and data science.\n\nOn the progressive left, however, a consensus is emerging that the real challenge is the rise of corporate consolidation and the decline of worker bargaining power. That in turn has allowed businesses to funnel excess profits to shareholders rather than higher wages, which would incentivize workers to pursue the type of education that made the most sense for them financially.\n\nIn order to take aim at that issue, Democrats like Booker and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin have introduced bills that would restrict companies' ability to buy back their own stock as well as direct federal regulators to scrutinize corporate mergers more carefully.\n\n\"We think what's really important is that policymakers are articulating a diagnosis of the economy that really centers the role of outsized corporate power, and the role of government to curb that power,\" says Stephanie Sterling, vice president for advocacy and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. \"We're not going to upskill our way to an economy where working people are getting a fair share.\"\n\nHooking infrastructure money to the end of fossil fuels\n\nPretty much everybody in Washington agrees that America's deteriorating roads, bridges, train tracks, transit networks and utilities need a surge of investment. But some Democrats argue those fixes should be wrapped into a plan to phase out fossil fuels entirely and massively scale up capacity for renewable energy generation in an effort to address global warming and lingering joblessness in one fell swoop.\n\nAn energized grassroots coalition led by freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez waged a campaign against House leadership to set up a select committee focused on crafting a \"Green New Deal,\" which would decarbonize the economy and provide universal employment.\n\nThe campaign for a committee failed, and there are still parts of the Democratic Party \u2014 such as transportation and building trade unions, whose members currently depend on continuing investment in highway construction and natural gas pipelines \u2014 who remain skeptical. But activists have vowed to keep fighting for the proposal as infrastructure plans surface in the next session, and they already have the support of 43 current or incoming members of Congress.\n\n\"The more momentum there is for a Green New Deal, the more that pulls the entire infrastructure debate in a bold direction,\" says Adam Green, co-director of a left-wing advocacy group called the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"It's not crazy to think that we could leave this year with 100 or even 150, 200 members who believe the Green New Deal is a North Star for when we have more power in 2021.\"\n\nA delicate line on trade\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic establishment was blindsided by how much anger Trump channeled by invoking the harsh legacy of trade deals in the industrial Midwest. Now they have to figure out how to heed that anger, while also avoiding Trump's chest-thumping rhetoric on tariffs, which turns off voters in both agricultural and urban districts.\n\n\"I think there's a danger with agreeing too much with Donald Trump on trade,\" said Third Way policy vice president Jim Kessler. \"We've seen the price that we're paying for tariffs. There's a difference between getting tough on China and igniting a trade war.\"\n\nThe new Congress will be forced to confront trade issues by way of a vote on the update to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Few Democrats are completely happy with the re-branded U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement, but enough of them view it as a step in the right direction \u2014 curtailing corporations' right to sue nations over restrictions on investments, for example \u2014 that it has a chance of passing, with some tweaks.\n\nThe problem is, the changes demanded by trade-skeptical Democrats may lose votes among more conservative Democrats, not to mention Republicans. A band of progressives led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut have demanded stronger enforcement mechanisms for the new labor and environmental standards, as well as a rollback of the intellectual property protections that grant pharmaceutical companies years-long monopolies on drugs.\n\nWhat happens in this fight will matter in 2020, as Democrats try to avoid letting Trump claim victory on trade while also dropping the established position that globalization creates more winners than losers.\n\nA new direction for the Middle East?\n\nDemocratic leaders have rushed to embrace their historically diverse slate of nominees. But as those newly elected voices enter Congress, a vexing question hangs on the horizon: When it comes to Israel, the Palestinians and the Middle East, does the party establishment really want to hear what they have to say?\n\nTrump's own renewed focus on the Middle East -- including his withdrawal from Syria, his reaction to the killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing war in Yemen -- have returned focus to the region generally at a time when peace negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians have collapsed.\n\nIncoming lawmakers like Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar are all challenging mainstream Democratic orthodoxy over the US' relationship with Israel.\n\nThe first two Muslim women elected to Congress, Tlaib and Omar have expressed support for the movement to boycott Israel over its activities in the West Bank and Gaza. BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, is a controversial program that has been met with harsh opposition by Israel and its supporters \u2014 particularly elected officials in the American government. A Senate bill called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would ban US companies from taking part in international boycotts like BDS, pits sponsors from both parties against progressive rivals and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes it on free speech grounds.\n\nThe bill remains in limbo for now, stalled after Sanders and Caifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated their opposition in a letter addressed to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"While we do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, we remain resolved to our constitutional oath to defend the right of every American to express their views peacefully without fear of or actual punishment by the government,\" Feinstein and Sanders wrote.\n\n\"Straight up, the party is not ready for the debate that is coming,\" one senior Democratic Senate aide told CNN. \"It is an overdue debate and my strong sense is that no, the party is not ready to have it \u2014 look who the foreign policy leaders are. But that doesn't matter because it's coming.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the most current wage ranges proposed by Third Way."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Are the wheels coming off China's Belt and Road megaproject?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/arRZffxhwbc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Hong Kong (CNN) Kenya is the latest country where China is frantically defusing a public relations storm over President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road megaproject .\n\nIn a statement Friday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed as \"not true\" numerous reports that a key port in Mombasa was at risk of being seized by Beijing over unpaid debts.\n\n\"The Chinese government themselves say this (it) is nonsense,\" Kenyatta said, while the AG's office denied publishing any such letter, copies of which circulated widely online.\n\nDespite Beijing and Nairobi's vehement denials, concerns over the loans speak to a growing fear in many developing countries that their governments, in rushing to cash in on China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), have left themselves overextended, with Chinese state-owned companies ready to snap up ports, railways and other key infrastructure across the globe should debtors default.\n\nFive years into the BRI, the sheen is also coming off the project in Beijing, amid an ongoing -- though temporarily paused -- trade war with the US, and concerns over future funding and returns on an increasingly unwieldy list of overseas investments.\n\nDebt fears\n\nFor critics of the BRI, Sri Lanka's Hambantota port is the perfect example of the risks developing countries are taking on with their Chinese loans.\n\nIn December 2017, Beijing acquired a 99-year lease to the port -- located in a key strategic position on the Indian Ocean -- in return for forgiving some of the billions of dollars the South Asian country owed China.\n\nThe move sparked fears China would use similar defaults in other countries to acquire a host of new infrastructure, with both potential economic and military benefits -- leapfrogging rivals in the region such as India and the US.\n\nIn mid-2018, the Zambian government had to deny reports it was preparing to hand over control of multiple public assets, including the state broadcaster and Lusaka's Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, to China.\n\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta (left) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the welcome ceremony for the Belt and Road Forum, near Beijing in May 2017.\n\nKenya's own issues date to 2014, when Nairobi signed a multi-billion-dollar deal with the state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation to fund a new rail link between the Kenyan capital and Mombasa, on the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe train line, known in Kenya as the standard gauge railway (SGR) project, was completed in 2017, slashing the transport time between the country's two largest cities. It is now in its second phase, with the Kenyan government reportedly borrowing a further $1.6 billion from China to fund a line from Nairobi to Naivasha.\n\nBut while the SGR has been a boon to residents of Nairobi and Mombasa, it has yet to generate half the revenues anticipated in feasibility studies, according to The East African newspaper -- raising fears over the country's ability to repay the loan. It has also been criticized for being vastly overpriced, reportedly costing about three times the international standard.\n\nRepayments are due to start in mid-2019, when a five-year grace period expires. On Friday, Kenyatta insisted that \"we are ahead of our payment schedule.\"\n\n\"We are not tied to any country,\" he added.\n\n'Land grab'\n\nIn the first half of 2018, Chinese companies provided overseas loans of about $50 billion, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), adding to the more than $8 trillion of investment previously announced.\n\nHowever, that figure was down on the same period the year before as concerns grew over the BRI both overseas and back in China.\n\n\"(Late 2018) saw a number of high-profile projects suspended ( including in Malaysia ) or scaled back ( including in Myanmar ) amid growing concerns over debt sustainability and transparency,\" the EIU report said.\n\nMany countries that were initially willing to take Beijing's money have expressed concern over what could happen should they default on debt payments, particularly after the Sri Lanka deal.\n\nPart of the problem stems from Beijing's \"ad hoc approach\" to settling debt issues, according to a report by the Center for Global Development (CDG), which pointed to a lack of consistency in dealing with defaulting nations. In the past, China has been willing to write off or restructure debts and extend further lines of credit, while at other times it has demanded assets to service the loans.\n\n\"Without a guiding multilateral or other framework to define China's approach to debt sustainability problems, we only have anecdotal evidence of ad hoc actions taken by China as the basis for characterizing the country's policy approach,\" the CDG report said.\n\nThis creates significant uncertainty, and forces governments borrowing from China to rely on maintaining strong bilateral ties above all else to ensure future lending policies.\n\nA rail link between the Kenyan cities of Mombasa and Nairobi has been a boon to passengers, but critics say it cost too much and leaves the country exposed to China.\n\nAfrican leaders heaped praise on President Xi after the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing in September, with Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi telling state media \"we admire and hold you in very high regard! Keep the innovation, friendliness and international outlook as bright as the Chinese spirit!\"\n\n\"Your friends in Botswana wish the very best for a successful One China!\" he added, an apparent reference to Beijing's policy regarding Taiwan, a key element in its approach to Africa, where numerous countries have dropped diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing in recent years\n\nElsewhere, however, concerns and uncertainty over the BRI have sparked a backlash against China -- particularly in the Maldives and Malaysia, where opposition parties critical of Beijing have recently taken power.\n\nIn January 2018, former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed accused Beijing of staging a \"land grab\" in his country. After his Maldivian Democratic Party took power this November, it pledged to end \"China's colonialism\" and renegotiate loans agreed by former strongman Abdulla Yameen with Beijing.\n\nIn August, recently elected Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad shelved two Chinese-funded projects over fears they could \"bankrupt\" the country.\n\nChina has vigorously pushed back against such criticism, saying it is subjected to a double standard.\n\n\"It is unreasonable that money coming out of Western countries is praised as good and sweet, while coming out of China it's sinister and a trap,\" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in September\n\nFork in the road\n\nWhile the loudest criticism of the Belt and Road Initiative has come from overseas, there are also growing doubts over the project within China.\n\nSince the BRI was launched , critics have warned the scheme could leave China overextended, with billions of dollars wasted on projects that never pay off. While Beijing may acquire control of certain projects in return for forgiving debts, any strategic wins could be outweighed by a host of white elephant investments that offer little benefit to China.\n\nrecent survey conducting by Peking University and the Beijing-based Taihe Insitute found that nearly half of 100 countries evaluated were not a good fit for BRI projects due to weaknesses in financing and infrastructure, adding that the government should \"assess and prevent the risks\" before pushing ahead with them.\n\nThe BRI is also facing pressure from Washington -- despite the temporarily paused trade war -- and other rival nations keen to restrain China from supplanting their influence over developing countries, as well as a potential funding shortfall for future projects.\n\nWhile boosters for the BRI remain plentiful, and the project is not on the verge of failing any time soon, there are signs that a shift is underway. The number of contracts signed in 2018 was down on previous years, and country's big development banks have reportedly been told to partner with the World Bank and other international lenders on future projects.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative was supposed to be Xi's signature project, one that would drive China back to its traditional position of power and dominance both in Asia and wider afield."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Kim Jong Un: Nuclear tyrant or global statesman?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/UV5b7oUfsgc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Kim Jong Un shocked the world in 2018 by transforming his image from nuclear-armed tyrant to global statesman.\n\nSo what does he have up his sleeve for 2019?\n\nAnalysts believe that key clues will emerge during his annual New Year's Day speech -- essentially North Korea's version of the State of the Union in the United States.\n\nExperts will be watching for any mention of a second summit with US President Donald Trump or anything on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. Kim could also reveal key decisions on economic policy and inter-Korean relations.\n\nIn a sign of his new diplomatic push, Kim sent a letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday. In it, Kim said he regretted not being able to visit Seoul in 2018 but expressed a strong will to travel to the South Korean capital in the future.\n\nFew expect Kim to rock the boat dramatically in Tuesday's speech.

Most do not expect Kim to risk his standing in a speech that's largely intended for a domestic audience.\n\n\"He's got the United States and South Korea where they want them right now,\" said Evans Revere, a former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and current senior director with the Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nNorth Korea's diplomatic achievements in 2018 would have been unthinkable a year earlier. In the lead up to Kim's 2018 New Year's speech, Pyongyang had tested its most advanced long-range missile to date and its most powerful nuclear bomb, after months of similar weapons tests and saber-rattling between North Korea and the US.\n\nFew would have predicted that the following year, Kim would meet Moon three times, leave his country for the first time since taking power in 2011 and become the first North Korean leader to sit face to face with a sitting US President.\n\nJUST WATCHED South Korean train heads North for first time in decade Replay More Videos ...

The two leaders agreed to start rebuilding the bilateral relationship and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. In terms of nuclear weapons, North Korea committed \"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" a vague term that experts say Washington and Pyongyang interpret differently.\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea expert says nuclear threat remains Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea expert says nuclear threat remains 11:43\n\nCritics accuse the Trump administration of failing to get Pyongyang to sign on to anything specific. North Korea has not agreed to any timeline to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nor has it committed itself to declaring its weaponry and key weapons facilities -- steps that experts say are crucial in any disarmament talks.\n\nExperts will be watching for any mention of the nuclear program in next year's speech, especially if it strikes the defiant tone of this year's address -- when Kim declared that \"no force and nothing\" could reverse the gains his country had made in nuclear weapons development.\n\n\"He said that this January, but he's engaged in this diplomatic process with the US,\" said Duyeon Kim, a adjunct fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see how Pyongyang negotiates going forward because Kim Jong Un claimed this year that nobody could reverse their nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nEconomics\n\nClues about what Pyongyang sees as the speech's key passages often come in the form of rhetorical devices, such as when Kim switches to a first-person voice, according to John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Affairs in Seoul.\n\nDelury said he'll watch closely for comments about the country's economic development, something likely to be highly scrutinized inside North Korea and which could prove to be the most important part of the speech.\n\nIn the 2018 speech, Kim acknowledged that the moribund economy was in need of a boost and committed himself to improving it. However North Korea does not make its economic statistics available internationally, making it difficult to precisely track its economic performance and determine what proportion of its population works in more modern fields.\n\nJust days before his first summit with Moon in April , Kim took the drastic step of declaring that North Korea had successfully completed its nuclear weapons program and would suspend nuclear and missile tests. It would now solely focus on effort to \"dramatically raise people's lives\" by developing a \"strong socialist economy.\"\n\nThe two-pronged strategy of nuclear and economic development, known as \"byungjin,\" had been in place since shortly after Kim took the reins from his father in 2011. Abandoning it represented a significant policy shift.\n\nHowever, the regime has yet to articulate a coherent vision or plan with respect to development.\n\n\"There's some pressure in this year's New Year's speech to articulate a vision of a real focus on economic development,\" Delury said.\n\n\"How does Kim Jong Un reflect this strategic shift to economic development?\"\n\nIn recent months, North Korean state media has focused heavily on economic issues, often touting the importance that people inside the country work vigorously to increase production.\n\nBut that hardly constitutes a plan. Investors see North Korea as a land ripe with opportunities, and they're looking for a strategy that would allow for infrastructure investments connecting South Korea to Russia by rail or opening up North Korea's relatively well-educated, low-wage workforce to manufacturers from the region.\n\nAll of that, however, is off-limits at the moment due to the sanctions levied on Pyongyang as punishment for its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd Delury says it's unlikely for Kim to come out and just announce a detailed strategic shift. As is everything with North Korea, the devil will be in the details.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect a kind of revolutionary statement of a new economic concept, but you kind of have to look within their language for what are progressive ideas by North Korean standards,\" Delury said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Venice to charge up to $11 for day visits", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/J7GopJvuV98/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) \u2014 A trip to the already pricey city of Venice, Italy , will now leave your wallet even emptier than before.

Beijing has begun pushing for a greater stake in the region with a view to opening new trade routes, exploring for oil and gas and conducting research on climate change, experts say.\n\nGeographically, China is nowhere near the Arctic Circle, which puts the Asian powerhouse at a major political disadvantage compared to eight countries that make up the Arctic Council, all of whom have territory inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nCouncil members are divided on China's growing interest in the region. Some smaller economies like Iceland and Norway see an opportunity, others with a strategic interest like Russia and Canada are growing wary.\n\nChina isn't the only non-Arctic state interested in the region but it is by far the biggest, China and polar region expert Marc Lanteigne of Massey University in New Zealand told CNN.\n\nIn 2013 it joined India, South Korea, Japan and Singapore in gaining non-voting observer status on the Council.\n\n\"Overall, there's been the acceptance that China is going to be a player there, but there is still some concern about the ambiguity to what China's endgame is,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nArctic Council foreign ministers with then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on May 11, 2017.\n\nPolar silk road\n\nIn January, Beijing published its first Arctic strategy white paper, claiming a vested interest in the region while attempting to allay fears over its territorial ambitions.\n\nIt defines itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in the document, saying environmental changes in the Arctic have a \"direct impact on China's climate system and ecological environment.\"\n\nThe white paper details Beijing's plans for a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure program, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping whose government has spent big to build vast trade corridors across the world.\n\nWhile the Belt and Road initiative has drawn criticism in the West due to concerns that China is ensnaring developing countries in debt, Lanteigne says it's welcomed by some of the smaller Arctic players keen on building economic ties with Beijing.\n\n\"It has excited quite a few of the Nordic states who see the possibility of expanded Chinese sea traffic and potentially new ports,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nThe idea of a mutually beneficial partnership is exactly the reassuring message China sought to drive home in its Arctic policy, with repeated references to \"cooperation.\"\n\nMelting sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast on March 30, 2017 above Greenland.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to Arctic Council concerns before China's admission, when members feared it could seek to repeat its South China Sea territorial grab in the Arctic Circle.\n\nBeijing claims an enormous swath of territory in the South China Sea, and has created heavily fortified artificial islands to help assert its position in the Spratly and Paracel island chains.\n\nIn comparison, the situation in the Arctic is relatively peaceful, according to experts, with no serious territorial disputes. And the Arctic states are eager to keep it that way.\n\n'Brimming with economic potential'\n\nBeijing claims the main reason for its interest in the Arctic is scientific research.\n\nIn the white paper, it detailed a desire to investigate the effects of climate change to \"resolve global environmental issues.\"\n\nBut skeptics have argued that China's Arctic ambitions are largely fueled by the economic and political appeal of dominating a resource-rich area.\n\nIt is estimated that the Arctic may hold nearly one-third of the world's natural gas and 13% of global oil reserves, according to a report by Rachael Gosnell at the University of Maryland.\n\nAnd as rising temperatures melt the region's ice, shipping routes that were once impassible are now an attractive and feasible alternative for the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The Arctic is brimming with economic potential,\" said Gosnell, who estimates that the annual economy of the region exceeds $450 billion.\n\nAccording to NASA, some global climate models predict the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months by the middle of this century, likely making its waters an important shipping route.\n\n\"China really wants to put itself in a position whereby, should there be some kind of scramble or push for Arctic resources, China would be very well placed to take advantage of that,\" said Lanteigne, the polar region expert.\n\nTo secure that position, it is strengthening its Arctic capabilities. In September, China launched a second icebreaker known as Xue Long 2, or Snow Dragon 2, with an expedition scheduled for the first half of 2019, according to state-run media.\n\nThe newly minted vessel is the first Chinese-built icebreaker. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation claims it will be more capable of cutting through ice and carrying out advanced research than its foreign-built predecessor.\n\nChina's first domestically-built icebreaker, Xuelong 2, during a launch ceremony at a shipyard in Shanghai in September.\n\nWashington's loss, Beijing's gain\n\nChina has been quick to recognize the importance of investing in the Arctic at a time when there are few participants and even fewer laws, so that it can eventually restructure Arctic governance in its favor, said Harriet Moynihan, associate fellow at the UK think tank Chatham House.\n\nChina's increasing involvement in the Arctic Circle has also coincided with a growing lack of interest from Washington.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to eliminate a special envoy and representative for the Arctic region in 2017, as climate change dropped down the list of priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet. In 2018 only two functioning icebreakers remain, one of which is a heavy-duty vessel overdue for an update.\n\nThe Obama administration pursued an ambitious Arctic strategy to ensure the US remained a strong power in regional affairs, including plans to replace the heavy icebreaker by 2020.\n\nBut it's unclear where the US now stands on those plans. The US Coast Guard, which runs the icebreakers, faces significant budget cuts as more and more funding is reconsidered for border security.\n\n\"Because of the fact that the Arctic is not a priority for the Trump government, this has allowed China to take the steering wheel and accelerate their own Arctic policies,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nRussia is arguably the most active Arctic state, with a fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, and it is reluctant to allow non-Arctic countries to develop the region.\n\nBut facing mounting Western sanctions, Moscow's attitude toward China has warmed considerably. \"Russia realized that China was one of the few countries left that could really help with Siberian development,\" Lanteigne said.\n\n\"The two countries have cooperated in a number of Arctic ventures, including a liquefied natural gas project.\"\n\nWith large parts of the Arctic still difficult for China to reach, it remains less important to Beijing than investments in other parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia.\n\nBut China's presence in the far north is only likely to grow -- whether the Arctic states are pleased about it or not."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "From paychecks to pups: Get ready for new laws in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/b4HCliszX6E/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) When the New Year's confetti comes down at midnight, so will a wave of new laws across the country.\n\nFrom jury duty to pet purchases, here's a look at some of the changes for 2019:\n\nMinimum wages will get a boost\n\nAt least 19 states will increase their minimum wages on or around New Year's Day, according to the National Employment Law Project\n\nThe group's executive director, Christine Owens, said the increases come after years of frustration by hard-working, lower-income Americans.\n\n\"Working people are struggling to pay their bills, but they see that it's the corporations and the wealthy CEOs who are getting the tax breaks.

He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of solicitation to commit murder in the first degree, District Attorney Dan May said.\n\nProsecutors filed two murder charges because they have different theories. One is that he acted alone to kill Berreth, the other says he alone or with other people killed her during a robbery.\n\nThe three solicitation charges refer to soliciting the murder in three separate incidents. It could mean he allegedly solicited the same person three times or three people on different occasions.\n\nFrazee's arrest came almost a month after Berreth vanished on Thanksgiving near Woodland Park, a city between Denver and Colorado Springs.\n\nAuthorities do not believe Berreth is alive, but they have not found her body.

Berreth's mother has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nFrazee was at Freeman's home two days before his arrest, she said. She recalls him being concerned about what would happen to Kaylee if he was arrested, she said.

Our beautiful, intelligent, passionate Alex had worked, unpaid, at several animal-related ventures, most recently at Wolf Park in Battleground, Indiana. This was her fourth internship, because she really wanted to make a career of working with animals,\" they said.\n\nBlack was a native of New Palestine, Indiana, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nShe had started working at the Conservators Center -- her first out-of-state internship -- 10 days ago, her family said. The young woman was working in husbandry, or the care of animals.\n\n\"She was a beautiful young woman who had just started her career, there was a terrible accident, and we are mourning,\" the family said.\n\nThey asked that people consider donating to Wolf Park to honor Black.\n\nConservators Center 'devastated'\n\nThe Conservators Center said that a husbandry team was cleaning the enclosure when the attack took place.\n\n\"One of the lions somehow left a locked space and entered the space the humans were in and quickly killed one person,\" the center said on its Facebook page\n\n\"When our husbandry teams clean big cat enclosures they follow a safety protocol that involves moving the cats into a separate space and securing them before humans enter the adjacent space,\" the center said in a statement. \"The specifics of what happened are still under investigation.\"\n\nBlack was working under the supervision of a staff member, the center's executive director, Mindy Stinner, said, according to CNN affiliate WNCN\n\nMale lion was shot and killed\n\nStinner said all large cats are locked in a separate area from humans during the routine cleanings.\n\n\"At no time did the lion ever enter a space that was not enclosed by the park's perimeter fence,\" she said.\n\nCenter officials said Matthai, 14, was born at the facility shortly after his mother was placed there as the result of a government-assisted confiscation in 2007. He was euthanized by first responders \"by necessity,\" officials said.\n\nStinner said visitors were at the park but officials safely and quickly got them out.\n\n\"This is not a situation we've ever had before. Safety is a very, very important feature of running any zoological park,\" she said.\n\nNo one else was injured in the attack.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Division is investigating the incident, said department spokeswoman Dolores Quesenberry.\n\nCenter is closed until further notice\n\nThe zoological park houses more than 80 animals, including tigers, small wild cats and other small carnivores, according to its website. It offers guided walking tours near the animal enclosures. The park is regulated by the US Department of Agriculture, according to Stinner.\n\nNo problems were identified during routine inspections in January 2017 and April 2018, according to Agriculture Department records. The 2018 inspector counted 16 lions out of 85 animals.\n\nStinner, an educator, co-founded the center in 1999 in Mebane as an educational nonprofit to provide a home for select carnivore species, according to the center's website. It relocated to a 45-acre swath in 2001, the website said.\n\nStinner said it first started doing rescue and sanctuary work, but moved away from that emphasis and worked with more species, trying to involve the community more. \"We like to think of ourselves as kind of a community zoo,\" she said.\n\nThe center is closed until further notice, officials said.\n\n\"We need to assess our situation, and we need to make sure that everyone here is safe and feels safe,\" Stinner said, \"because this is a very scary thing.\"\n\nThe center said it appreciated the outpouring of concern for the Black family and traumatized staff members.\n\n\"Although Alex was with us for a very short time, she made an impact on our community.

Elizabeth Warren's announcement in the dying hours of 2018 that she is launching an exploratory committee -- the first step toward a campaign for the party's nomination.\n\nThere was an ominous feel to the holidays given the dark cloud hanging over Trump because of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose findings could take the nation down the bitter road to impeachment in the year to come.\n\nBut the President doesn't just have to worry about Mueller. Democrats are days away from taking control of the House of Representatives and inaugurating a novel challenge for Trump's presidency -- congressional oversight.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 265 points to close 2018, in a sleepy session compared to the stomach-wchurning instability that produced the worst year for stocks in a decade and could fuel economic uncertainty that could play into the 2020 race.\n\nAnd as always, there are signs of instability and chaos in the White House, with confusion over Trump's exact position on a border wall and his planned Syria troop withdrawal, while key staff vacancies were unfilled.\n\nShutting government to please the base\n\nTrump stayed at home, often largely alone in the White House over the Christmas and New Year's break, tweeting at Democrats but with no real political movement evident over the shutdown. Often the aim seemed to be to talk solely to his political base -- a trend that is likely to go on all year.\n\n\"I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!\" Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon.\n\nIt's unclear how Trump plans to get out of the partial shutdown that has hit hundreds of thousands of federal workers, since Democrats are disinclined to grant funding for his border wall.\n\nHe could have avoided the shutdown altogether had he agreed to sign on to a stopgap measure that passed the Senate last month and would have kept government open in the short term, but would not have funded the wall.\n\nBut the President backtracked under pressure from conservatives in the House and right-wing media commentators like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nSo to climb down now would risk similar condemnation and the possibility of a weakening of support among base voters on whom he depends for political viability, given his decision not to try to broaden his 2016 coalition.\n\nWith a weak but stable political standing -- between 40% and 45% approve of the job he's doing in most polls -- the President clearly understands that he needs to engineer a series of base-pleasing fights this year to keep his political foundation intact.\n\nBut as Democrats take over the House, they have little incentive to bail the President out -- at least until there is evidence that his tactic of branding them weak on border security is causing them political damage.\n\nAfter all, Trump won election by saying Mexico, not US taxpayers, would pay for the wall. And he said he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall in a notorious Oval Office clash with Democratic leaders.\n\nThe next move in the saga will come later in the week, when Democrats put the ball back in the Republican court.\n\nThe soon-to-be Democrat-controlled House is expected to vote on six Senate spending bills and a stopgap measure to reopen the Homeland Security Department at its current funding levels until February 8, a Democratic aide told CNN Monday.\n\nAlthough the temporary measure would maintain the current $1.3 billion in border security money, Senate GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't move any legislation until Trump signs off.\n\nSo both sides are staring at a dead end.\n\nThe calendar says 2019 -- but it's already 2020\n\nWarren took the first plunge of the front-running Democratic pack, giving her a head start on the first quarter fundraising race that will be used to assess the viability of the top contenders. She is likely to find the field crowded very soon.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator carved out populist economic ground with her opening message, stressing her humble roots and wholesome family background and accusing billionaires and corporations of attacking the middle class.\n\nWarren's strengths include long crusades against big banks and Wall Street titans, as Democrats seek a candidate that can loosen Trump's hold on working-class voters in the industrial Midwest in 2020.\n\n\"Corruption is poisoning our democracy,\" Warren said in a web video filmed in her kitchen, and then hit out at \"bigotry and fear\" in a sidelong reference to Trump.\n\nPundits are already questioning, however, whether Warren has missed her moment, will be viewed as too old at 69, or will be seen as too white at a time when a youthful and ethnic transformation is taking place in the Democratic Party.\n\nHer effort to defuse Trump's attacks over her claims to Native American heritage last year with a DNA test was widely seen as botched and damaging to her candidacy by Beltway insiders.\n\nStill, Warren has a jump on other rivals, possibly including California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe stirring Democratic race will also give Trump something he has long lacked, but loves -- a new enemy that he can use to define his own re-election bid and a genuine opening onto the campaign trail, where he excels.\n\nThe jockeying for position among Democrats and how the candidates respond to withering fire from Trump will define the first year of the 2020 campaign.\n\nIt's always Mueller time\n\nA reminder of where we were before the holiday.\n\nTrump's campaign, transition, inaugural committee and presidency are under active investigation. So are his business, the Trump Organization, and his defunct charity, the Trump Foundation. The President was indirectly implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws.\n\nPredictions that Mueller would wrap up his investigation into alleged election collusion with Russia and possible presidential obstruction of justice by the end of 2018 turned out to be wide of the mark.\n\nBut every week that went by late last year brought more bad news for Trump and signs Mueller is closing in on the President following a flurry of legal filings, court moves and convictions, and guilty pleas against close Trump associates.\n\nQuestions swirl around Trump's longtime political adviser Roger Stone, about, among other things, what he knew about WikiLeaks email dumps and when he knew it. And people even closer to Trump, such as his son Don Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner, cannot be sure they are in the clear, although all, including the President, profess innocence and downplay Mueller's investigation.\n\nRising pressure on the White House may have prompted Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to escalate the effort to discredit the special counsel over the holiday.\n\n\"My ultimatum is put up or shut up, Bob,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox and Friends\" on Sunday.\n\n\"What do you have? There are those of us who believe you don't have anything on collusion,\" he continued. \"And by the way, it's not a crime. So what the heck are you doing?\"\n\nDespite such defiance, Mueller could have the most fateful impact on the political year if he concludes that Trump has something to answer for in a report that could put the entire presidency in peril.\n\nTurmoil in the West Wing\n\nThe first half of Trump's term has generated unprecedented turmoil, turnover and chaos in the West Wing. There's no reason to think that changes now.\n\nThe President enters the new year more liberated from \"adults in the room\" than ever, and freer to follow his impulses. What that means became clear late last year, with his sudden Twitter announcement of a full troop withdrawal from Syria with the words \"they are coming back now.\"\n\nThe President's willingness to follow his gut was also reflected in his lurch into a government shutdown.\n\nYet in the days since, his improvisational governing style has sparked strategic confusion about his intentions on both issues.\n\nAfter meeting the President for lunch on Sunday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared to signal that Trump was having a change of heart at least about the pace of withdrawals from Syria.\n\nOn Monday, Trump hit out at comments by his departing chief of staff, John Kelly, who had suggested in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that the concept of a concrete wall had been abandoned long ago.\n\nBut before Christmas, the President tweeted that the wall would in fact be made up of \"artistically designed steel slats\" that border agents could see through.\n\nThe confusion is yet another sign that the President's often shifting positions and goals -- which he sees as the key to keeping his foes off balance -- will mean another year of political whiplash in Washington."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The 5 House chairs who are about to make life much harder for Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ovdbzUYj138/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump will face an intensified level of scrutiny in the new year, with Democratic House committee chairs poised to comb through every corner of his administration, subpoena his Cabinet and investigate his personal finances, associates and business interests.\n\nWhile Trump has directed his political attacks at Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi , it's the committee chairs who will soon become his greatest foes.\n\nThe President -- no stranger to name calling or political swipes -- has already begun jabbing some of the incoming chairs on Twitter over the past two years, and he has decades of history with one of the new leaders. But despite Trump's declarations that he's prepared to play hardball with the Democratic investigators, there's a new crew of Democrats in Washington -- rising from the party's return to the majority in the House of Representatives -- who have subpoena power and are prepared to use it.\n\n\"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

Jerry Nadler of New York dates to the 1980s, when they battled over Manhattan real estate while Nadler was in the New York State Assembly before he was elected to Congress. In his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump called Nadler \"one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.\"\n\n\"This guy wanted to put a railroad yard on the same property where I wanted to build a park and create the best middle-income housing in New York,\" Trump wrote in his book.\n\nNow Nadler is set to lead the Judiciary Committee, which would put him i n charge of any Democratic impeachment effort. His committee will also be in charge of handling a report from special counsel Robert Mueller and any fights that may arise about making it public.\n\nNadler's committee also has jurisdiction over Trump's signature issue: immigration, an area Nadler is poised to conduct rigorous oversight on -- from family separation to changes to asylum laws -- in the new Congress.\n\nNadler has said it's too soon to talk impeachment , even though there's a sizable chunk of Democratic advocates -- not to mention some House lawmakers -- who already want to move forward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nadler: Impeachable offense doesn't mean impeachment Replay More Videos ...

Schiff is expected to chair the House Intelligence Committee starting in January. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAdam Schiff\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is no stranger to Trump's Twitter tongue lashings . As the top Democrat on the Republican-led House Russia investigation in 2017 and 2018, Schiff was a constant television presence breaking down the newest revelations about Russia and Trump's team.\n\nThe President has used multiple nicknames on Twitter for the California Democrat -- Sleazy Adam Schiff, Liddle' Adam Schiff and most recently \"little Adam Schitt\" -- a sign of his prominence among Trump's Democratic critics.\n\nSchiff has accused Republicans of failing to investigate the ties between Trump's team and Russia, and he's promised to restart his committee's Russia investigation in several areas.\n\nAmong them: Schiff wants to investigate questions about Russian money laundering, to learn who Donald Trump Jr. was calling as he set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and to interview officials the committee has yet to speak to, like Michael Flynn.\n\nSchiff is a soft-spoken lawmaker, but he's shown a willingness provide headline-grabbing quotes.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first President in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time,\" Schiff said earlier this month on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal criticizes the Republican tax plan during at the US Capitol in November 2017 in Washington, DC. Neal will chair the House Ways and Means Committee in January. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRichard Neal\n\nIn the new Congress it will be Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a deal-focused Democrat, who will have the job of asking for Trump's tax returns . While modern presidential nominees have publicly released their returns, Trump has defied the norm, which Democrats argue must be remedied.\n\nUnder IRS rules, there are only three people on Capitol Hill who can ask the Treasury Department for the President's tax returns: the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal is the only Democrat.\n\nWhile Neal has said he wants to ensure that requesting the returns doesn't distract from his committee's work on infrastructure, health care and oversight of the GOP's tax bill, a source close to the process told CNN that Neal has largely given up hope that Trump will turn over his tax returns willingly, given comments from the President's allies. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN that the President would be prepared to fight in court over any formal request.\n\nThe source familiar with the process told CNN that Neal is prepared to ask the Treasury Department for the returns in the new year. When exactly he would do it is still under discussion.\n\nTrump's tax returns aren't of interest just to Neal, however. Other incoming committee chairs have said the information within the returns could advance their own oversight.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what ... has been the sources of income for this President,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the expected chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nCummings continued, \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia, we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\"\n\nElijah Cummings\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the minority, Cummings has perhaps the broadest authority to investigate the Trump administration of any Democrat on Capitol Hill. Cummings -- even with his deep and focused voice -- is reserved, but strategic about the plans for his committee.\n\nA foil to Republican chairs like Rep. Darrell Issa of California, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, Cummings has argued he plans to be in search of answers, not headlines -- although with his gavel, it's unlikely he will be able to avoid them.\n\nCummings has laid out a very clear path for his committee. Earlier this month, he re-sent 51 letters he'd sent while in the minority, asking the administration to comply by January 11. The letters ranged from questions about Cabinet secretary travel to immigration to security clearances to hurricane recovery efforts by the administration. But Cummings has also warned that he doesn't want his committee to only zero in on Trump's perceived failings.\n\n\"I believe that what we do in this Congress over the next year or so will have impact for the next 50 to 100 years,\" Cummings said. \"We're going to cautiously go about with subpoenas. ... There would have to be something that has a compelling interest to the citizens of the United States, and would have to be something that comes under our jurisdiction. So there's certain criteria that has to be met. I do not expect to be issuing subpoenas -- even the 64 that we've asked for because there are so many things that are backed up. And we'll never get a chance to do everything.\"\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, looks on before speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC in January. Waters will chair the House Financial Services Committee in January.\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nRep. Maxine Waters of California was pushing for impeachment back in 2017 , and she's been among the most vocal and well-known Democrats to do so. Now she'll run the Financial Services Committee, which will give her an avenue to probe the finances of Trump and the Trump Organization.\n\nThat's also made her a target for the President, who went after Waters during the 2018 campaign in tweets and at campaign rallies as a way to fire up his base. He's also attacked Waters as a \"low IQ person,\" which she has said is a racist attack.\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\" Trump tweeted in June. \"She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nWaters has made controversial statements of her own, including her call for supporters to publicly harass members of the administration in response to Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to family separations at the border.\n\nWhile in the minority, Waters pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, a lender to Trump that was separately implicated in a Russian money laundering operation in 2017. She's also pushed the Treasury Department to divulge financial ties between Russia and the Trump family.\n\nThe jurisdiction of Waters' committee makes it likely she'll clash with Trump in a way that particularly hits home for him: his finances."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump unwilling to compromise on deal for border security funding even as allies float potential solutions", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/YNu3KBshKWQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) In the midst of a government shutdown caused by a budget battle over border security funding, chances of a resolution remain slim as President Donald Trump is privately telling officials and lawmakers he won't sign a bill that comes to his desk with only $1.3 billion allotted for border security, according to sources involved in the negotiations.\n\nDemocrats take over the House this week and have shown no signs of budging.\n\nTrump, who shelved plans to travel to Florida and remained in Washington over the Christmas holiday, has continued to dig in, even as lawmakers floated potential compromises Sunday. After a two-hour lunch with Trump, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters the President had not committed to a resolution but Graham was hopeful a compromise could be reached in the coming days.\n\n\"(The) President didn't commit but I think he's very open minded,\" the South Carolina legislator said after their lunch.\n\nGraham proposed providing $5 billion for border security \"in areas that make sense\" in exchange for legislative changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and immigrants with temporary protected status. Graham said Trump called the idea \"interesting.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Democrats have any interest in Graham's proposal, and none voiced support for it publicly Sunday.\n\nBut even as Trump signals willingness to hear ideas from his allies on Capitol Hill, officials and allies close to the President said it is still not clear what he would sign. Asked on Sunday if the President will sign or veto a bill that Democrats pass, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that \"it depends what's in it,\" but added that Trump is \"ready to negotiate.\" As far as the type of border security Trump is looking to get funded in a deal goes, Conway did not offer specifics, but told Bash that \"it's anything -- it's all of the above.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Mitch McConnell has said he will not bring a vote to the floor unless the President has endorsed it.\n\n\"We pushed the pause button,\" McConnell said the day the government was scheduled to partially close, \"until the President, from whom we will need a signature, and Senate Democrats, from whom we will need votes, reach an agreement.\"\n\nThe White House made an offer to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer last Saturday night that included more than $1.3 billion but less than the $5 billion Trump initially wanted. A White House official said Schumer did not immediately reject the proposal of $2.5 billion, but during a call this week, Schumer informed the White House that Democrats do not expect to accept or counteroffer the White House's proposal, according to a second official. A Schumer spokesperson said Thursday that the White House and Democrats were \"still very far apart,\" but the spokesperson said Schumer made it clear at the time of last Saturday's meeting that Democrats would not accept the offer.\n\nAs the President has continued to watch television coverage of the shutdown and phone allies in recent days, he has told them he will not give up his signature campaign promise. But there are now questions about whether or not he will follow through on his promise to supporters to build a concrete wall. During her appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Conway repeatedly referred to it as \"border security\" and not a wall. And Trump's outgoing chief of staff John Kelly, who has been largely uninvolved in the shutdown negotiations, said in an interview published Sunday that the wall Trump is hammering Democrats over is not actually a concrete wall and hasn't been since the early days of the administration.\n\n\"To be honest, it's not a wall,\" Kelly told the Los Angeles Times. \"The president still says 'wall' \u2014 oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\"\n\nGraham said he pitched Trump on a possible deal \"that would include around $5 billion for border security slash wall slash fencing -- whatever you want to call it, in areas that make sense -- and deal with another problem that's looming.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Chief Pentagon spokeswoman announces departure", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/FQITjyvn_8k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Chief Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White is leaving her post, a move that coincides with Secretary of Defense James Mattis stepping down but also comes amid an internal Defense Department investigation into her conduct.\n\n\"I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by this administration to serve alongside Secretary Mattis, our Service members and all the civilians who support them,\" White tweeted Monday. \"It has been my honor and privilege.

It's legal to sell to anyone,\" he said.\n\nYet in recent years, more attention has turned to how much alcohol young people are drinking, not necessarily the age at which drinking starts.\n\nResearch suggests that the greater economic wealth a country has , the more alcohol is consumed and the higher the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking.\n\nWhere teen drinking is highest and lowest\n\nBinge or heavy episodic drinking can be measured as consuming at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. Worldwide, about 16% of drinkers 15 and older engage in heavy episodic drinking, according to WHO.\n\n\"Ten grams of alcohol is a standard drink , which is approximately almost a bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a standard drink of spirits,\" Rekve said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a standard drink as equal to 14 grams of pure alcohol.\n\nIn 2016, the country with the highest percentage of 15- to 19-year-olds reporting heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days was Luxembourg, with 54%, according to WHO. Equatorial Guinea followed with 53.7% and then Lithuania with 53.2%.\n\nNo other countries had more than half of teens in that age group report heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days.\n\nCountries where no 15- to 19-year-olds reported heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days were Mauritania, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"Europe usually is really high, both for the adult population and for 15- to 19-year-olds,\" Rekve said. More than one-fifth of the European population 15 and older has reported heavy episodic drinking at least once a week, according to WHO.\n\nHe added, however, that many European countries have recently seen a drop in alcohol use that mirrors the number of adolescents abstaining from drinking altogether.\n\nOne study, published in the journal BMC Public Health in October, found that 29% of 16- to 24-year-olds in England were non-drinkers in 2015, up from 18% in 2005.\n\nWHO report published in September found that, across 15 European countries and regions, more than 1 in 5 15-year-old girls reported weekly drinking in 2002, with the highest prevalence in England, Scotland, Malta and Denmark. But by 2014, only Malta had a prevalence greater than 20%.\n\nAmong 15-year-old boys, more than 1 in 5 reported weekly drinking across 24 European countries and regions, with the highest prevalence in Malta, Denmark, England, and Wales. But by 2014, only nine countries and regions had a prevalence greater than 20%, with the highest prevalence in Croatia, Malta, and Italy, according to the report.\n\nIn the United States, rates of binge drinking among teenagers also have been on the decline.\n\nThose percentages were down from 2013, when it was reported by 10.2%, 25.7% and 39.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the report.\n\nOverall, the percentage of teenagers in America who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases,\" she said\n\nHow heavy drinking can affect young people's health\n\nStudies have varied, but some researchers say no amount of alcohol is good for your health, and binge drinking can damage the body and brain, especially in a young person. Evidence suggests that heavy exposure to alcohol can be tied to brain impairment and cognitive deficits , including memory problems.\n\nJUST WATCHED How alcohol affects your health Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How alcohol affects your health 01:16\n\nIn general, excessive alcohol consumption ranks as the leading risk factor for an early death or disability in 15- to 49-year-olds, Rekve said.\n\nIn other words, of all the factors that could raise your risk for death or disability -- such as tobacco use or physical inactivity -- too much drinking was the leading risk factor globally among that age group in 2016, according to a study published in The Lancet in August.\n\nThe study, based on an analysis of data for 195 countries and territories, found that alcohol use was associated with 3.8% of deaths in girls and women in that age group and 12.2% of deaths in boys and men in the same age group.\n\n\"At the same time, we know that almost 60% of the world's population are not currently drinkers who are 15 years and older. That means that there might be a lot of changes in the future that we need to be aware of,\" Rekve said, referencing how in 2016, 57% of men and women worldwide reported abstaining from drinking alcohol in the past 12 months.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn September, WHO launched an initiative called SAFER in an effort to help governments around the world reduce the harmful impacts of excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nThe initiative features five strategies : enacting and enforcing policies related to alcohol, advancing and enforcing measures to reduce drunken driving, facilitating access to interventions or treatment for alcohol problems, enforcing restrictions around alcohol advertising and considering alcohol taxation and pricing policies."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "American doctor will be monitored in US after possible exposure to Ebola in Congo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/WwbbbIFHnsc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An American was possibly exposed to Ebola while recently providing medical assistance in Congo, according to a release from the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n\nThe person, who has not been identified, is headed to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha for monitoring, the release states, adding the Nebraska Medical Center is home to one of the nation's few dedicated biocontainment units.\n\n\"This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,\" said Ted Cieslak, infectious diseases specialist with Nebraska Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health. \"Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Medicine/UNMC team is among the most qualified in the world to deal with them.\"\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo is going through one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history.

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open .

Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima.\n\nWith the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New Horizons' chief scientist Alan Stern: \"It's pure science and pure exploration\"\n\nBut assuming all turns out well, New Horizons can begin to downlink the gigabytes of stored data, with the first close-up images set for release on Wednesday.\n\nUltima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @plutoport New Horizons just completed all radio science uplinks and released the DSN stations. Next up is the Phone Home Jan 1 10:30am EST. Ultima ready for close up! \u2014 Alice Bowman (@plutoport) January 1, 2019 Report\n\nNew Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images.\n\nMission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima.\n\n\"It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,\" he said. \"But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing.\"\n\nWhen the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface.\n\nMission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May.\n\nThe rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images.\n\n\"This mission is about human curiosity. The need of mankind to explore and see what makes the Universe tick. My song is an anthem to the human endeavour,\" he said.\n\nWhy is New Horizons visiting Ultima Thule?\n\nNasa wanted to explore something beyond Pluto and this object was reachable.\n\nRemarkably, it was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nIt's a Latin phrase that means something like \"a place beyond the known world\".\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its size, it is likely to be composed of a lot of ice, dust and maybe some larger rock fragments, which came together at the dawn of the Solar System.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobate form. Think potato or peanut. The latest image from Dr Spencer would seem to bear this out, but time will tell.\n\nDistant telescopic observations have suggested Ultima's surface is very dark, with a bit of a red tinge. That darkness (it reflects only about 10% of the light falling on its surface) is probably the result of having been \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, rotation, geology, composition and environment.\n\nScientists want to know how these far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized grains.\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. As we've already seen, this flyby isn't like the one at Pluto where the images became increasingly - but also gradually - resolved on approach. Ultima will flash by and the best pictures will be obtained in a very narrow window.\n\nThe much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed, but this does all depend on accurate pointing.\n\nAnd, remember, because New Horizons has to swivel to train its instruments on a target, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nThe \"hey, I'm healthy and I've got a treasure trove of data\" message should be sent about four hours after closest approach.\n\nImage copyright NASA / JHUAPL / SWRI Image caption The detail in the highest resolution pictures should be better than New Horizons achieved at Pluto\n\nJust how big a challenge is this flyby?\n\nIn some ways, this event is more difficult than New Horizons' pass of Pluto.\n\nFor one thing, the object in the viewfinder is almost a hundred times smaller.\n\nNew Horizons really must get its pointing right or it could be sending back pictures of empty space.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of doing everything at a separation from Earth of 6.62 billion km (4.11 billion miles).\n\nIt takes radio signals six hours and eight minutes to traverse that space.\n\nWhat is more, the distance combined with a 15-watt transmitter on the probe means the data rates are glacial - around 1,000 bits a second.\n\nIt will be late on Tuesday before the first selected images are downlinked, and it will be September 2020 until every last scrap of data from the flyby is pulled off New Horizons.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "New Year celebrations: UK welcomes in 2019", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46725268", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:20", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption London counts down to new year fireworks\n\nThe UK has welcomed in 2019 with a flurry of new year fireworks.\n\nIn London, Big Ben's customary bongs marked midnight, cheered on by an estimated gathering of 100,000 people.\n\nThe words \"London is open\" were spoken in seven languages during the display, which London mayor Sadiq Khan said sent a message that its EU citizens were Londoners and would always be welcome.\n\nIn Edinburgh, the city's street party was a 60,000 sell-out, with Franz Ferdinand the headline musical act.\n\nCardiff saw crowds gather in the city's Winter Wonderland outside the Civic Centre for fireworks and music, while in Belfast, City Hall was illuminated in a raft of colours for the event.\n\nIn central London, the soundtrack to the midnight show, which celebrated the capital's links with Europe, featured musical artists from the continent.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Tickets to London's fireworks display sold out in advance\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Songs by artists including Dua Lipa, Rita Ora, U2 and Coldplay accompanied the display\n\nWe Are Your Friends, Stay and Don't Leave Me Alone were some of the songs played during the 11-minute soundtrack.\n\n\"London is open\" was spoken around two minutes into the display in Spanish, Polish, French, Romanian, German, Italian and then in English by the capital's mayor.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Big Ben's traditional bongs welcomed in the new year\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption About 70,000 fireworks were set off from three barges and the London Eye\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Revellers head home from central London following the fireworks display\n\nBBC One's New Year's Eve concert at Central Hall Westminster - either side of the fireworks - featured ska-pop legends Madness and was presented by this year's Strictly Come Dancing champion Stacey Dooley and finalist Joe Sugg.\n\nJoe's Strictly partner Dianne Buswell joined him at the event, delighting fans of the show.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @lucybreivogelll we was literally 10 minutes into 2019 & already was blessed with the Joe Sugg & Dianne Buswell content we ALL deserved.

the US.\n\nMr Kim met US President Donald Trump to discuss denuclearisation in June 2018 but with few results so far.\n\nLast year's rapprochement came after a turbulent 2017 marked by North Korea testing missiles that could reach the US mainland and an escalation in rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington with both sides trading insults and threats of nuclear destruction.\n\nThe annual New Year's address is a tradition Mr Kim picked up from his grandfather, founder of the communist country, Kim Il-sung.\n\nThe speech is aimed primarily at a domestic audience and, like in previous years, focussed largely on the economy, but international observers scan every line for clues to Pyongyang's international agenda as well.\n\nIn this year's speech, broadcast on state television early on Tuesday, Mr Kim said \"if the US does not keep its promise made in front of the whole world... and insists on sanctions and pressures on our republic, we may be left with no choice but to consider a new way to safeguard our sovereignty and interests\".\n\nThe BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says this could mean that North Korea is waiting for the US to act in 2019 and unless it does, the current pause on nuclear weapons testing could be over.\n\nNorth Korea is subject to various sets of United Nations Security Council sanctions related to its banned nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programmes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea for now has stopped its nuclear and missile testing\n\nMr Kim said that North Korea had already pledged not to make, use or spread nuclear weapons and had taken concrete steps to implement this.\n\nHe also said he was ready to meet Mr Trump again at any time.\n\n\"The tone was what many had expected,\" Oliver Hotham of news site NK News, told the BBC.\n\n\"In all, a speech that boosts his standing at home on key issues while sending a conciliatory but firm message to the US, all the while continuing to woo Seoul with the prospects of renewed cooperation.\"\n\nIt was in last year's New Year's message that Mr Kim announced North Korea would take part in the Winter Olympics hosted by the South, which led to a thaw in relations.\n\nAfter a flurry of diplomatic activity, in April Kim Jong-un met South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a summit at the inter-Korean border.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption This was

President Donald Trump in Singapore in June.\n\nIn what was the first time a North Korean leader met a sitting US president, the two signed a vaguely phrased agreement to improve ties and work towards denuclearisation.\n\nSince the Trump-Kim summit though, less progress has been made than at least optimists had been hoping for.\n\nWhile the North has stopped missile and nuclear testing, there's been little indication that Pyongyang is working towards complete and verifiable denuclearisation as the US has called upon it to do.\n\nThe North has dismantled some testing facilities but there are allegations it is continuing its weapons programme.\n\nPresident Trump has said he expects a second summit to take place as early as February but there has been no confirmation yet.\n\nThere are also plans for Kim Jong-un to travel to the South's capital Seoul for another inter-Korean summit but again, those plans have not been confirmed yet."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link":

BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains\n\nThe American space agency's New Horizons probe is in the midst of an encounter with a giant ball of ice and dust nicknamed Ultima Thule.\n\nThe flyby, taking place 6.5 billion km from Earth, is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System object.\n\nNew Horizons should be filling its memory banks right now with a swathe of photos and other scientific data.\n\nOnce the probe has gone past Ultima, it will turn to radio home a status report that should arrive at 15:28 GMT.\n\nThis initial contact ought to give controllers a good idea of how New Horizons performed as it swept over the 30km-wide world just 3,500km from its surface.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption Ultima appears elongated: One of the last pictures returned to Earth before the flyby\n\n\"Go New Horizons!\" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence.\n\n\"Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away.\"\n\nEarlier, he said: \"I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out.\n\n\"We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima.\n\nWith the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New Horizons' chief scientist Alan Stern: \"It's pure science and pure exploration\"\n\nBut assuming all turns out well, New Horizons can begin to downlink the gigabytes of stored data, with the first close-up images set for release on Wednesday.\n\nUltima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @plutoport New Horizons just completed all radio science uplinks and released the DSN stations. Next up is the Phone Home Jan 1 10:30am EST. Ultima ready for close up! \u2014 Alice Bowman (@plutoport) January 1, 2019 Report\n\nNew Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images.\n\nMission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima.\n\n\"It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,\" he said. \"But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing.\"\n\nWhen the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface.\n\nMission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May.\n\nThe rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images.\n\n\"This mission is about human curiosity. The need of mankind to explore and see what makes the Universe tick. My song is an anthem to the human endeavour,\" he said.\n\nWhy is New Horizons visiting Ultima Thule?\n\nNasa wanted to explore something beyond Pluto and this object was reachable.\n\nRemarkably, it was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nIt's a Latin phrase that means something like \"a place beyond the known world\".\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its size, it is likely to be composed of a lot of ice, dust and maybe some larger rock fragments, which came together at the dawn of the Solar System.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobate form. Think potato or peanut. The latest image from Dr Spencer would seem to bear this out, but time will tell.\n\nDistant telescopic observations have suggested Ultima's surface is very dark, with a bit of a red tinge. That darkness (it reflects only about 10% of the light falling on its surface) is probably the result of having been \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, rotation, geology, composition and environment.\n\nScientists want to know how these far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized grains.\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. As we've already seen, this flyby isn't like the one at Pluto where the images became increasingly - but also gradually - resolved on approach. Ultima will flash by and the best pictures will be obtained in a very narrow window.\n\nThe much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed, but this does all depend on accurate pointing.\n\nAnd, remember, because New Horizons has to swivel to train its instruments on a target, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nThe \"hey, I'm healthy and I've got a treasure trove of data\" message should be sent about four hours after closest approach.\n\nImage copyright NASA / JHUAPL / SWRI Image caption The detail in the highest resolution pictures should be better than New Horizons achieved at Pluto\n\nJust how big a challenge is this flyby?\n\nIn some ways, this event is more difficult than New Horizons' pass of Pluto.\n\nFor one thing, the object in the viewfinder is almost a hundred times smaller.\n\nNew Horizons really must get its pointing right or it could be sending back pictures of empty space.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of doing everything at a separation from Earth of 6.62 billion km (4.11 billion miles).\n\nIt takes radio signals six hours and eight minutes to traverse that space.\n\nWhat is more, the distance combined with a 15-watt transmitter on the probe means the data rates are glacial - around 1,000 bits a second.\n\nIt will be late on Tuesday before the first selected images are downlinked, and it will be September 2020 until every last scrap of data from the flyby is pulled off New Horizons.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Jair Bolsonaro: Brazil's far-right leader to take office", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46720899", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:30", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Jair Bolsonaro will govern Brazil for the next four years\n\nA far-right former army captain will be sworn in as Brazil's new president later on Tuesday.\n\nJair Bolsonaro, 63, won the presidential election by a wide margin against Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party on 28 October.\n\nMr Bolsonaro was propelled to victory by his campaign promises to curb Brazil's rampant corruption and crime.\n\nBut he has proven a deeply divisive figure whose racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks have angered many.\n\nWho is he?\n\nDespite portraying himself as a political outsider during his campaign, Mr Bolsonaro served seven terms in Brazil's lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, before being elected president.\n\nHe has been a member of several political parties but is currently in the Social Liberal Party (PSL), which has grown from having a tiny presence in Congress to becoming the party with the second largest number of deputies in the lower house.\n\nBefore becoming a politician, Mr Bolsonaro served in Brazil's military, where he was a paratrooper and rose to the rank of captain.\n\nHow close are his ties to the military?\n\nVery. During his time as a lawmaker, Mr Bolsonaro represented the interests of the armed forces and since his election he has named seven former military men to key ministries.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Bolsonaro has chosen ex-military officers for many key government posts\n\nHe has also expressed nostalgia for the time when Brazil was under military rule and the hard-line policies enforced during the period in which thousands were jailed and tortured.\n\nHe has praised that era as a \"glorious period\" in Brazil's history.\n\nWhy has his election caused such a stir?\n\nBrazil only returned to democracy in 1985 after more than 20 years under military rule and some critics see his election as a threat to the country's democracy.\n\nSince being elected, Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly stated that he he is committed to democracy and that he will abide by Brazil's constitution.\n\nBut previous comments he has made endorsing the use of torture and disparaging women, gay people and Afro-Brazilians have left many Brazilians worried.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why are same-sex couples in Brazil rushing to get married?\n\nThe election campaign which brought him to power has left the country deeply divided into those who see him as the man to put Brazil onto the right track after massive corruption scandals rocked the country and those who fear he could lead Brazil into an authoritarian future.\n\nWhat are his key policies?\n\nMr Bolsonaro's key campaign promises were to drive down crime and to stamp out corruption, which has seen scores of top businessmen and high-ranking politicians, including former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, jailed.\n\nIn order to achieve the former, he wants to loosen laws on gun ownership so that \"honest citizens\" can carry arms and \"protect themselves\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Bolsonaro has a strong following among Brazilians who favour relaxing gun ownership laws\n\nOn Saturday, he tweeted that he would issue a decree to allow citizens who do not have a criminal record to own guns.\n\nDays after being elected, he picked Brazil's most famous anti-corruption judge, Sergio Moro, as his minister of justice.\n\nMr Moro, who has been the key force behind the massive Car Wash corruption investigation, accepted despite having said in the past that he would never enter politics.\n\nWhile the move was welcomed by some who see Judge Moro as a relentless fighter against corruption others criticised the judge for \"abandoning\" his corruption investigation.\n\nWhy are environmentalists worried?\n\nEnvironmentalists were aghast when Mr Bolsonaro announced that as part of his drive to streamline Brazil's government, he would merge the ministry of agriculture and that of the environment.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Ricardo Salles has been chosen as the new environment minister by Mr Bolsonaro\n\nMr Bolsonaro argued that such a move would cut down on the red tape farmers faced but environmentalists feared that it would erode the protection of the Amazon rain forest.\n\nDays after his election and in the face of severe criticism by the then-ministers of the environment and agriculture he backtracked on the issue.\n\nJust days before the second round of the election, he also revoked a pledge to quit the Paris climate accord, which sets targets for cutting greenhouse gases.\n\nThe man he has named as his environment minister has since confirmed that Brazil will remain part of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWhat does it mean internationally?\n\nMr Bolsonaro has been very clear about who he considers to be his international allies and those he views as foes.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is \"an example\" to him and Mr Bolsonaro has promised to follow the US lead and relocate Brazil's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Bolsonaro visited a synagogue with Benjamin Netanyahu in Rio\n\nFollowing a meeting with Mr Bolsonaro on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was only a matter of \"when, not if\" Brazil would make the move.\n\nMr Bolsonaro has been scathing in his criticism of the left-wing governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela and cancelled invitations to their leaders to his inauguration.\n\nHe also accused Cuba of holding back some of the salaries paid to Cuban doctors working in Brazil, prompting Cuba to pull out their doctors in retaliation.\n\nBut his harshest words have been for those \"reds\" he accuses of corruption within Brazil.\n\nSpeaking to his supporters ahead of the second round, he said he would \"purge\" the country of such criminal elements and they would face either jail or leaving Brazil

However, while people on default tariffs should now be paying a fairer price for their energy, they will still be better off if they shop around,\" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.\n\n\"People can also make longer-term savings by improving the energy efficiency of their homes. Simple steps, such as better insulation or heating controls, are a good place to start.\"\n\nHow the cap works\n\nHouseholds in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs - such as standard variable tariffs - should be better off after the cap is introduced. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. Those on a prepayment meter already have a price cap in place. Those who chose their tariff are ineligible.\n\nSavings depend on how much energy is used in the household and how the bill is paid. The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less.\n\nThe cap is on the unit price of energy, and the standing charge. So the cost of electricity - for those on default tariffs - is capped at 17p per kWh. Gas is capped at 4p per kWh.\n\nDual fuel users will pay no more than \u00a3177 a year for a standing charge; electricity-only users will pay no more than \u00a383, and gas users \u00a394.\n\nOfgem will review the tariff in February, and then adjust it in April and October each year. It has said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower than \u00a376.\n\nThe regulator will then judge the effect on the energy market in 2020, and the secretary of state will then decide whether to extend it by another year, or whether to end it at that time.\n\n\"The energy price cap can only be a temporary fix - what is now needed is real reform to promote competition, innovation and improved customer service in the broken energy market,\" said Alex Neill, from Which?.\n\nWhat do the suppliers think?\n\nSome have already changed the way they organise their tariffs.\n\nCentrica - which owns the largest UK supplier, British Gas - has said that it will mount a legal challenge to the way the cap has been calculated.\n\nIt is applying for a judicial review against Ofgem, saying the regulator had set the threshold too low.\n\n\"Through this action Centrica has no intention to delay implementation of the cap, and does not expect the cap to be deferred in any way,\" the company has said in a statement.\n\n\"As we have previously said, we do not believe that a price cap will benefit customers but we want to ensure that there is a transparent and rigorous regulatory process to deliver a price cap that allows suppliers, as a minimum, to continue to operate to meet the requirements of all customers.\"\n\nWill the cap lead to less switching?\n\nThose who have argued against the introduction of a price cap have said it will be counter-productive, as it will lead to fewer people switching - where the potential savings are greater.\n\nWhich? has argued that some of the cheapest deals on the market have already disappeared, as suppliers needed to make up some of the money lost as a result of the cap.\n\nIt analysed deals priced at \u00a31,000 a year or less for a medium energy user at the beginning of the year compared to now, and found there had been a sharp drop in availability."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "UK can 'turn a corner' if MPs back Brexit deal, says May", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46721508", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA\n\nThe UK can \"turn a corner\" and start to \"put its differences aside\" if Parliament backs the proposed Brexit deal, Theresa May has said.\n\nIn her new year message, the prime minister said 2019 would mark a new chapter for the country outside the EU.\n\nShould MPs approve the exit terms later this month, she said the UK could \"move forward together\" and concentrate on other issues like housing and health.\n\nLabour has said the Brexit process is a \"complete mess\" due to Tory divisions.\n\nThe UK is scheduled to leave the union on 29 March, but it is unclear what will happen if MPs reject the withdrawal agreement and the framework for future relations.\n\nMPs are due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the proposals reached with the EU.\n\nDowning Street has said there is \"still work to do\" - as the PM seeks to persuade sceptical Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the agreement does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016.\n\nThe prime minister is continuing to seek further assurances from European leaders about aspects of the agreement, notably the controversial Irish border \"backstop\", designed to prevent physical customs checks on the island of Ireland.\n\nNo 10 said the prime minister had been in contact with European counterparts during the Christmas break and that would continue in the coming week.\n\nIn her message, Mrs May said MPs had an \"important decision to make\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\n\"In 2019 the UK will start a new chapter.

The second time they got close to the English coast and phoned 999, seeking assistance from UK coastguards, but he said a French vessel turned up instead and they were returned to France.\n\nThe reason refugees are increasingly trying the sea crossing, we were told, is that heightened security around French ports and the Channel tunnel has made it almost impossible to stow away on lorries and trains.\n\nIt is in desperation that people are turning to boats instead.\n\nMr Javid, who returned from a family holiday in South Africa after coming under pressure to act, earlier agreed an \"enhanced action plan\" with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to be put in place in the coming week.\n\nIt includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokeswoman said Theresa May supported the home secretary's work to tackle the \"deeply concerning rise\" in migrants crossing the Channel on small boats.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Two more cutters will be deployed in the Channel\n\nDover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was important illegal migrants were not allowed to stay in the UK.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"What we need to see now is this Dover patrol work hand in glove with the French authorities in a new Channel compact, so that anyone found in the English Channel in one of these unseaworthy craft can be helped carefully and safely back to the French coast - so that they know there is no chance of getting into Britain.\"\n\nBut Ben Bano, from the Seeking Sanctuary migrant support group, warned migrants should not be demonised.\n\nHe said: \"We have to hold on to the fact that people, however desperate they are, are our brothers and sisters in humanity, and that is what we need to keep reminding people about.

But what I've been discovering recently has shaken me to the core.\n\nI can barely look a Babybel in the face. A half-eaten halloumi squeaklessly lies yellowing in the fridge. My cheese dreams are shattering.\n\nFor, after a lifetime of unfettered devotion, could it possibly be that cheese is more foe than friend? That I am addicted to something that is not so good for my body? That cheese should be toast?\n\nThese are questions that began surfacing a couple of months ago when I began making an episode for my new podcast for the BBC, All Hail Kale, looking into whether dairy was scary.\n\nFor some time, I'd increasingly been questioning the logic of adults drinking milk.\n\nWhile milk and dairy products, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein and calcium and can form part of a healthy, balanced diet, as Dr Michael Greger, from NutritionFacts.org, put it to me: \"There's no animal on the planet that drinks milk after weaning - and then to drink milk of another species even doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nHe then reeled off a series of studies showing the life-shortening potential of drinking this \"hormonal stew\".\n\nI'd always blithely assumed cheese was a more mature - perhaps benign or even more beneficial - form of dairy. It fitted a mental picture of spritely, long-living Greeks and Italians liberally sprinkling around feta and pecorino; yet in reality, only a low to moderate amount of cheese figures in the hallowed Mediterranean Diet.\n\nI'd also unilaterally decided that a childhood diagnosis of lactose-intolerance should in no way impede me from mainlining paneer when in India or, when skiing, spending more time forking bread into fondue than bothering with the slopes.\n\nDe-cheese?\n\nPerhaps this sense of denial-cum-delusion stems from an actual addiction. One US doctor controversially (and not supported by any of the professors I spoke to) refers to cheese as \"dairy crack\" - for apparently containing addictive, opiate-like chemicals - and even suggests a three-step programme to de-cheese.\n\nStep One: know why you want to break away.\n\nWell, I don't know that I do want to break away.\n\nBut in the journalistic pursuit of seeing whether cheese is a less scary form of dairy than milk, I took my head out of the sand (under which a special Turkish cheese is apparently fermented) and contacted three heavy-hitters in nutrition. They all agreed the milk secretion of another species is a strange thing for us to have latched onto - and adult humans have no need to drink it. But could a cheese consensus be reached?\n\nDr Michael Greger took a hard line: cheese, with its combination of sodium and concentrated butterfat, should not be part of our daily diets. \"Make it for a special occasion rather than the day-to-day.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDr Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health - took a more semi-hard view of cheese. \"It does not seem to have the same growth-promoting effects as milk does. Have your Brie in moderation and enjoy it.\" He said we should have only one portion of dairy a day.\n\nOver at Cornell University, its Nutrition professor David Levitsky took a distinctly softer stance on the perils of dairy - and confessed to having a small cheese plate before dinner every night. \"I enjoy it, but I don't eat masses of cheese.\"\n\nThe consensus, of sorts, was that cheese should certainly not be at the high end of the spectrum.\n\nIn the spirit of de-ostriching, I then went to see a GP, Dr Enam Abood from the Harley Street Health Centre to get my lactose intolerance retested 30 years on.\n\nShe confirmed that not only was the intolerance still in force but by ignoring it I might have inflamed my gut.\n\nAccording to Dr Abood, my ropey gut means I'm probably not absorbing vitamins and minerals, which isn't great for my immune system, energy levels, and even maybe my mood.\n\nThe damage is most likely the result of me overdoing dairy for years.\n\nDr Abood recommended that if I consume cheese, I should pop a lactase pill - giving me the enzyme I, and many people like me, lack to be able to digest dairy properly.\n\nThe one silver (gut) lining from my medical travels was an intestinal expert telling me that a nice piece of bacteria-rich, non-processed, unpasteurised cheese will go down a treat with the gut microbiome.\n\nHaving also been making an All Hail Kale episode on the crucial role of the gut to your moods, this seemed like an excellent rationale to keep cheese on the table.\n\nI never got as far as Step Two: think about what you can do to change the recipes you have already. Step Three - think about the non-dairy cheeses - seemed too much to even consider stomaching.\n\nInstead, I think about how bewildering it is to get definitive answers around nutrition. I think I should remember to carry around lactase enzyme pills. And I think my gut would want me to have a little slice of Roquefort\u2026 tomorrow.\n\nDownload BBC Sounds to listen to All Hail Kale."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Minority take up 'life-saving' free health check", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46701195", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:00:49", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Monitoring blood pressure is part of the free health check\n\nFewer than half of people eligible for a NHS health check in England have taken up the offer, despite it being free to everyone over 40.\n\nThe routine check can pick up heart problems early and help to prevent dementia, plus highlight the need to stop smoking, NHS England said.\n\nThe check-up takes 20 minutes and is carried out by a GP or nurse.\n\nIt involves tests on blood pressure, weight and height, and is offered every five years up to the age of 74.\n\nAround 7.15 million people have had a free health check since 2013, yet 15 million are eligible, NHS stats show.\n\nNHS England said identifying people with an irregular heartbeat or high blood pressure and giving them treatment would help to prevent dangerous blood clots which could lead to strokes.\n\nAnd if more people went for their health check, the number of people having a stroke or other heart problems would reduce, potentially preventing thousands of cases of vascular dementia.\n\nWho can have an NHS health check?\n\nAnyone between the age of 40 and 74 who is generally healthy and doesn't already have any diseases.\n\nYou should automatically get an invitation through your GP surgery or local authority every five years.\n\nAfter the age of 74 you can request a health check-up from your GP or nurse.\n\nWhat problems can they spot?\n\nBy checking blood pressure, family history, lifestyle, height and weight, it is possible to give an idea of your risk of getting heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearch shows that people with a history of heart diseases are at least twice as likely to develop vascular dementia.\n\nYou will receive personalised advice on how to lower your risk of all those conditions, usually by:\n\nimproving your diet\n\ntaking more exercise\n\ntaking medicines to lower blood pressure or cholesterol\n\nlosing weight\n\nstopping smoking\n\nIf you are 65 or over, you will be told the signs and symptoms of dementia to look out for.\n\nWhy this could be a 'life-saving step'\n\nSome people told the BBC the check had been time consuming.\n\nAnna Oxbury, from Cheltenham, said she had to go to her local hospital for the blood testing part of the check because her GP practice was unable to do it.\n\nShe said: \"I'm self-employed and reckon the 'free' health check, which meant three separate visits to practice and hospital, cost me over \u00a3100 in lost work time.\n\n\"My husband has an important job and could only make time for the check if he took a half-day holiday.

Next up is the Phone Home Jan 1 10:30am EST. Ultima ready for close up! \u2014 Alice Bowman (@plutoport) January 1, 2019 Report\n\nNew Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images.\n\nMission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima.\n\n\"It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,\" he said. \"But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing.\"\n\nWhen the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface.\n\nMission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May.\n\nThe rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images.\n\n\"This mission is about human curiosity. The need of mankind to explore and see what makes the Universe tick. My song is an anthem to the human endeavour,\" he said.\n\nWhy is New Horizons visiting Ultima Thule?\n\nNasa wanted to explore something beyond Pluto and this object was reachable.\n\nRemarkably, it was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nIt's a Latin phrase that means something like \"a place beyond the known world\".\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its size, it is likely to be composed of a lot of ice, dust and maybe some larger rock fragments, which came together at the dawn of the Solar System.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobate form. Think potato or peanut. The latest image from Dr Spencer would seem to bear this out, but time will tell.\n\nDistant telescopic observations have suggested Ultima's surface is very dark, with a bit of a red tinge. That darkness (it reflects only about 10% of the light falling on its surface) is probably the result of having been \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, rotation, geology, composition and environment.\n\nScientists want to know how these far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized grains.\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. As we've already seen, this flyby isn't like the one at Pluto where the images became increasingly - but also gradually - resolved on approach. Ultima will flash by and the best pictures will be obtained in a very narrow window.\n\nThe much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed, but this does all depend on accurate pointing.\n\nAnd, remember, because New Horizons has to swivel to train its instruments on a target, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nThe \"hey, I'm healthy and I've got a treasure trove of data\" message should be sent about four hours after closest approach.\n\nImage copyright NASA / JHUAPL / SWRI Image caption The detail in the highest resolution pictures should be better than New Horizons achieved at Pluto\n\nJust how big a challenge is this flyby?\n\nIn some ways, this event is more difficult than New Horizons' pass of Pluto.\n\nFor one thing, the object in the viewfinder is almost a hundred times smaller.\n\nNew Horizons really must get its pointing right or it could be sending back pictures of empty space.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of doing everything at a separation from Earth of 6.62 billion km (4.11 billion miles).\n\nIt takes radio signals six hours and eight minutes to traverse that space.\n\nWhat is more, the distance combined with a 15-watt transmitter on the probe means the data rates are glacial - around 1,000 bits a second.\n\nIt will be late on Tuesday before the first selected images are downlinked, and it will be September 2020 until every last scrap of data from the flyby is pulled off New Horizons.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mother of the Hubble: Tributes paid to Nasa scientist", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46720014", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Roman had a lifelong fascination with the stars\n\nTributes are being paid to Dr Nancy Grace Roman, the first woman to hold an executive position at the US space agency Nasa.\n\nDr Roman was known as \"Mother of the Hubble\" for her work on the early stages of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nNasa said her most important legacy was the advancement of women in the sciences and the generations of young scientists she inspired.\n\nShe died in Maryland on Wednesday at the age of 93.\n\nDr Roman was fascinated by the clear night skies of her childhood home in Nevada from a very early age.\n\nShe joined an astronomy club when she was just 11 and her passion for stargazing continued throughout her life.\n\nBut the young Dr Roman had to fight prejudice to be allowed to study maths and science at school and university.\n\n\"I still remember asking my high school guidance teacher for permission to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin,\" she once told the Voice of America.\n\n\"She looked down her nose at me and sneered, 'What lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?'

Three years ago, the UK was exporting half a million tonnes of plastic to China and Hong Kong - accounting for almost two-thirds of all our plastic sent abroad.\n\nChina introduced its ban on \"foreign garbage\" as part of a move to upgrade its industries 12 months ago. At the time, the UK recycling industry warned that the decision would be a \"game-changer\" and that it would be a struggle to deal with the country's waste.\n\nWhere is that plastic mountain?\n\nWell, it hasn't appeared - partly thanks to other countries taking our waste plastic instead, and partly because we are burning more of it.\n\nIn the wake of mass public alarm about plastic pollution we may also be producing less plastic waste, although it's impossible to be sure of the figures\n\nWho has taken our waste instead of China?\n\nIn the 12 months to October 2018, our analysis of Environment Agency figures shows that the UK exported a total of 611,000 tonnes of recovered plastic packaging to other countries.\n\nIn the previous 12-month period (ie to October 2017), the UK exported 683,000 tonnes.\n\nSo that works out as a drop in exports of 72,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-2018.\n\nIt's clear that other countries have imported much of the plastic packaging previously reprocessed by China.\n\nBut incineration in the UK has also increased, and we may be seeing the benefits of the Blue Planet effect on public behaviour.\n\nThe fact is we can't be certain from the data what exactly has happened to the shortfall.\n\nWhere did our plastic packaging go in 2018?\n\nWell, where there's waste plastic there's potentially profit - because some of it can be lucratively recycled. So some nations have geared up their reprocessing plants to welcome our waste with open arms.\n\nMany Chinese recyclers moved their operations abroad to benefit from cheap flows of plastic in the region before then re-exporting it back to China as recycled pellets.\n\nBut not all of it has been welcomed. Several countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan have heavily restricted imports because shipments were blocking ports and the quality of the material being imported (from all countries) was poor.\n\nSo while the amount of plastic taken by China dropped by 94% between 2016-17 and 2017-18, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland and Indonesia led the pack in gobbling up the slack.\n\nMalaysia imported 105,000 tonnes in total and was way out in front. That total was 42,000 (68%) more in 2017-18 compared with the previous year.\n\nThe second most popular destination was Turkey (80,000 tonnes).\n\nPoland is in third place on the league table - although it actually received slightly less UK plastic in 2017-18 than it did in 2016-17. It's not clear why.\n\nIn fourth place is Indonesia, which along with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam - is in the top 10 for the quantity of waste plastics polluting the ocean.\n\nWhich countries recorded the biggest increase in UK plastic over the period?\n\nAnother way of analysing the data is to rank the numbers in terms of net increase (ie which countries recorded the biggest increase in 2017-18 compared with 2016-17).\n\nOn this measure, Malaysia and Turkey remain at the top while Indonesia stays in the top five.\n\nThe new entries (replacing Poland and the Netherlands) are Spain and France. Spain recorded an increase of 14,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-18, and France was just behind on 9,000.\n\nOf course, sending material abroad for recycling doesn't necessarily mean it actually gets recycled.\n\nWaste firms in the receiving country may sift through the rubbish, take out the economically valuable material and burn or even dump the rest. The waste industry is notorious in some places for its links with criminal activity.\n\nThe global illegal waste trade is estimated by the UN to be worth between \u00a38bn-\u00a39.5bn a year.\n\nCase study: Malaysia\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Campaigners say illegal waste dumps in Malaysia have become a problem since China's plastic import ban\n\nSince China's ban, Malaysia has seen a big surge in the amount of plastic it has received from abroad, including from the UK.\n\n\"Malaysia is not able to process all of the imported waste, there are limited plastic waste factories\", says Mageswari Sangaralingam who works for the Consumers' Association of Penang and for Friends of the Earth, Malaysia.\n\nAccording to Ms Sangaralingam, not only is Malaysia receiving more plastic than it can properly dispose of, some of it is low-grade which ends up as landfill. There are also some rogue recyclers who, she says, burn plastic in the open - leading to environmental harm.\n\nThe Malaysian government has announced stricter conditions on the import of plastic and says it wants to phase it out over the next three years - but Ms Sangaralingam wants an immediate outright ban.\n\n\"Malaysia is not a dumping ground and hence should stop importing plastic waste,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Could Malaysia follow China's lead and ban plastic imports outright?\n\nWhat's the UK doing about the issue?\n\nThe British Plastics Federation (BPF) told us it was \"very worried\" about the export of poor quality plastic waste. The chairman of its recycling group, Roger Baynham, told us all that UK companies should make the very best efforts to ensure plastic goes to reputable recyclers:\n\n\"The export of plastic waste is out of the control of the industry and the BPF is particularly concerned about recent reports of illegal and fraudulent exports of plastic packaging waste routed to Asia through Holland.\"\n\nThe BPF also told us it would support a global accreditation system for the waste export sector and that recycling should be done at home.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove says the UK must stop \"off-shoring its dirt\". We asked the UK government why it didn't simply ban the export of waste plastic.\n\nWe were told that while the UK was committed to \"recycling more at home\" there is a \"legitimate export market for plastics particularly for countries that manufacture new products out of recycled plastic waste\".\n\nMr Gove wants to stimulate more recycling, but UK firms wanting to process more waste in Britain complain it's hard to get funding.\n\n\"There are very few countries left where we can comfortably export to and the market is shrinking,\" warns Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association.\n\n\"People don't want to buy this material, so where on earth is this all going to go?\" he adds.\n\nMr Ellin is largely supportive of the government's new waste strategy plan, but says the UK must expand its processing capacity at a faster pace:\n\n\"We're almost at a crisis point, unless we get a plan quickly,\" he says.\n\nLess than half of all household waste is recycled\n\nOverall recycling figures have stagnated and some councils are burning 80% of all residual waste, including recyclable plastic and paper.\n\nIn the 12 months to March, 50 of 123 councils incinerated more than half the household rubbish they collected, including plastic and paper, official figures recently revealed. The worst are in London. Westminster burned 82% of all household and recyclable rubbish.\n\nLess than half of all household waste (45.2%) was recycled in 2017 - a minuscule rise of just 0.3% on the previous year. The UK now seems unlikely to reach the EU-enforced target of 50% recycling in the next two years.\n\nThe Western Riverside Waste Authority, which covers Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Wandsworth, incinerated 79% as did Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. Slough, Kirklees, Sunderland, Portsmouth and Birmingham councils all incinerated at least 70% of all plastic, paper and household rubbish.\n\nSwindon Borough Council said in November it wants to burn plastic along with other rubbish rather than sending it abroad for recycling - saying some \"isn't properly recycled\".\n\nAnalysis by the BBC suggests that recycling rates are being hindered by the myriad of different rules which are in play up and down the country. It found that nearly half (47%) of Britons asked said they disagree about what should and should not be recycled.\n\nClaire Shrewsbury, from the recycling body Wrap, told BBC News: \"The time has come for the UK to take more responsibility for its own recovered materials, and move towards a circular system for plastics and other materials.\n\n\"There is a global market for high quality resource exports to countries that manufacture products, and this is something the UK should explore.\n\n\"This will require fundamental change from all of us. And that means regulatory transformation, collaborative industry action, together with citizen behaviour change.\"\n\nMs Shrewsbury aims her comments at anyone who buys stuff and throws packaging away.\n\nThat's all of us.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "How ancient DNA may rewrite prehistory in India", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46616574", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The origin of Indians has been the subject of a heated debate\n\nNew research using ancient DNA is rewriting prehistory in India - and shows that its civilisation is the result of multiple ancient migrations, writes Tony Joseph.\n\nWho are the Indians? And where did they come from?\n\nIn the last few years, the debate over these questions has become more and more heated.\n\nHindu right-wingers believe the source of Indian civilisation are people who called themselves Aryans - a nomadic tribe of horse-riding, cattle-rearing warriors and herders who composed Hinduism's oldest religious texts, the Vedas.\n\nThe Aryans, they argue, originated from India and then spread across large parts of Asia and Europe, helping set up the family of Indo-European languages that Europeans and Indians still speak today.\n\nAs it happens, many 19th Century European ethnographers and, of course, most famously, Adolf Hitler, also considered Aryans the master race who had conquered Europe, although the German leader considered them to be of Nordic lineage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Harappan civilisation thrived in north-western India and Pakistan\n\nWhen scholars use the term Aryan, it refers to a group of people who spoke Indo-European languages and called themselves Aryans. And that is how I have used it in this article. It does not refer to a race, as Hitler used it or as some in the Hindu right wing use it.\n\nMany Indian scholars have questioned the \"out of India\" thesis, arguing that these Indo-European language speakers - or Aryans - were possibly just one of many streams of prehistoric migrants who arrived in India after the decline of an earlier civilisation. This was the Harappan (or Indus Valley) civilisation, which thrived in what is now north-western India and Pakistan around the same time as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.\n\nHowever, Hindu right-wingers believe the Harappan civilisation was also an Aryan or Vedic civilisation.\n\nTensions between the two groups backing these opposing theories have only increased in the last few years, especially since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in India in 2014.\n\nInto this long-running dispute has now stepped the relatively new discipline of population genetics, which has started using ancient DNA to figure out when people moved where.\n\nStudies using ancient DNA have been rewriting prehistory all over the world in the last few years and in India, there has been one fascinating discovery after another.\n\nThe most recent study on this subject, led by geneticist David Reich of Harvard University, was published in March 2018 and co-authored by 92 scholars from all over the world - many of them leading names in disciplines as diverse as genetics, history, archaeology and anthropology.\n\nUnderneath its staid title - The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia - lay some volcanic arguments.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dholavira in Gujarat state is one of the five largest Harappan sites\n\nThe study showed that there were two major migrations into India in the last 10,000 years.\n\nThe first one originated from the Zagros region in south-western Iran (which has the world's first evidence for goat domestication) and brought agriculturists, most likely herders, to India.\n\nThis would have been between 7,000 and 3,000BCE. These Zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent - the First Indians, descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who had reached India around 65,000 years ago - and together, they went on to create the Harappan civilisation.\n\nIn the centuries after 2000 BCE came the second set of immigrants (the Aryans) from the Eurasian Steppe, probably from the region now known as Kazakhstan. They likely brought with them an early version of Sanskrit, mastery over horses and a range of new cultural practices such as sacrificial rituals, all of which formed the basis of early Hindu/Vedic culture. (A thousand years before, people from the Steppe had also moved into Europe, replacing and mixing with agriculturists there, spawning new cultures and spreading Indo-European languages).\n\nOther genetic studies have brought to light more migrations into India, such as that of the speakers of Austro-Asiatic languages who came from south-eastern Asia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption India's population is made up of a number of layers, according to the research\n\nAs I write in my book, the best way to understand the Indian population is to imagine it as a pizza, with the first Indians forming its base. Though the base of this rather irregular pizza is thin in some places and thick in others, it still serves as the support that the rest of the pizza is built upon because studies show that 50% to 65% of the genetic ancestry of Indians derives from the First Indians.\n\nOn top of the base comes the sauce that is spread over the pizza - the Harappans. And then come the toppings and the cheese - the Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European language speakers or Aryans, all of whom found their way into the subcontinent later.\n\nTo many in the Hindu right wing, these findings are unpalatable. They have been campaigning to change school curricula and remove any mention of Aryan immigration from textbooks. And on Twitter, several hugely popular right-wing \"history\" handles have long been attacking India's leading historians who have defended the theory of Aryan migrations and continue to do so.\n\nFor Hindu nationalists, there is a cost to admitting that the Aryans were not the first inhabitants of India and that the Harappan civilisation existed long before their arrival. It would mean acknowledging that Aryans or their Vedic culture were not the singular fountainhead of Indian civilisation and that its earliest sources lay elsewhere.\n\nIndia's junior minister for human resource development, Satyapal Singh, was recently quoted in the media as saying: \"Only Vedic education can nurture our children well and make them patriots who have mental discipline.\"\n\nThe idea of the mixing of different population groups is also unappealing to Hindu nationalists as they put a premium on racial purity. There is also the additional issue of the migration theory putting Aryans on the same footing as latter-day Muslim conquerors of India - such as the Mughals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi - India is a predominantly Hindu nation\n\nThese are not just theoretical debates. The ruling BJP government in Haryana state, which neighbours the Indian capital Delhi, has demanded that the Harappan civilisation be renamed the Saraswati river civilisation. Since the Saraswati is an important river that is mentioned in the earliest of the four Vedic texts, such a renaming would serve to emphasise the link between the civilisation and the Aryans.\n\nThe new study puts an end to these debates and it has thus come as a shock to the Hindu right-wing. In a tweet attacking its co-author Prof Reich, ruling party MP and former Harvard University professor Subramanian Swamy said: \"There are lies, damned lies and (Harvard's 'Third' Reich and Co's) statistics.\"\n\nHowever, the real message that the new research carries is an exciting and hopeful one: that Indians have created a long-lasting civilisation from a variety of heredities and histories.\n\nThe genius of the Indian civilisation during its best periods has been inclusion, not exclusion. Unity in diversity is, indeed, the central theme of India's genetic make-up.\n\nTony Joseph is the author of Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From, published by Juggernaut"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Pete Tong NYE 'balloon drop' cancelled after protests", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46721487", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The Manila resort had hoped to get into the Guinness book of World Records\n\nA plan to break records by releasing 130,000 balloons at a resort in the Philippines on New Year's Eve has been cancelled after a backlash over its potential environmental impact.\n\nThe party, at Okada Manila, is being headlined by British DJ Pete Tong.\n\nOrganisers had insisted the indoor event held no environmental risk as the balloons would be recycled.\n\nBut on Sunday both the resort and Tong confirmed it had been cancelled after the government got involved.\n\nIn a statement, Okada Manila said it \"voluntarily\" decided to cancel the event \"as a sign of respect\" for the government's campaign to protect the environment.\n\nIt came after they received a letter from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Sunday encouraging a change of plan.\n\nThe resort, part of a sprawling hotel and casino complex in the Philippine capital, had said that the balloons were made of \"biodegradable latex materials\" and they would be recycled afterward - not released into the air.\n\nHowever its social media pages had been inundated with concern about its message, including from campaigners such as Greenpeace Philippines.\n\nOne petition, calling for its cancellation, had garnered tens of thousands of signatures before the announcement.\n\nThe party, at the resort's Cove Manila beach club, will still take place without the world-record attempt.\n\nIn a Sunday night tweet Pete Tong confirmed promoters had dropped the balloon stunt.\n\nIn the posts below, people responded positively to the news, and shared images about the dangers of plastic pollution.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The DJ has thanked fans that raised concerns\n\nEnvironmental groups around the world, including the UK's Marine Conservation Society, have warned about the dangers balloons can pose to marine life.\n\nThe organisation says that even latex balloons marked as biodegradable can remain in an ocean environment for four years.\n\nSome places, including parts of Australia, have already banned balloon releases because of their impact."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Earth Passes Through Temporal Vortex Hurling Planet Into Year 2019", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/earth-passes-through-temporal-vortex-hurling-planet-int-1831408120", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Kinja is in read-only mode.

The rising oceans have turned freshwater sources brackish, imperilling communities and raising doubts the nation will exist at the next New Year. Former President Anote Tong said the only future for Kiribati may be mass migration.\n\nThe new year was welcomed in the capital, Tarawa, with church services and mostly quiet private celebrations.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nIn Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, tens of thousands gathered around Sky Tower as fireworks exploded from the top of the 328-metre structure.\n\nAcross the southern hemisphere nation, thousands took to beaches and streets, becoming the first major nation in the world to usher in 2019.\n\nNew Year has already arrived in New Zealand !!!

The show used 8.5 tonnes of fireworks and featured more than 100,000 pyrotechnic effects, the city's biggest-ever fireworks display.\n\nSydney's firework display for New Years.

In Brisbane, an estimated 85,000 people watched as fireworks exploded from five barges moored on the Brisbane River.\n\nPhilippines\n\nDozens of people have been injured by firecrackers ahead of New Year's Eve when many across the Philippines set off powerful firecrackers in one of Asia's most violent celebrations despite a government scare campaign and threats of arrests.\n\nThe Department of Health said it has recorded more than 50 firecracker-caused injuries in the last 10 days, which is expected to increase overnight when Filipinos usher in 2019 with a bang.\n\nLet's have a safe and healthy New Year\u2019s Eve celebration!\n\n\n\nTry alternate means of welcoming 2019:\n\n\ud83c\udf86 Watch the community fireworks display\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Blow a horn\n\n\ud83c\udf72 Clang household items together such as pots & pans\n\n\ud83c\udfb6 Sing#HappyNewYear2019! pic.twitter.com/56cu2DJE9h \u2014 World Health Organization Philippines (@WHOPhilippines) December 31, 2018\n\nAlthough still a concern, the figure is significantly lower than a year ago, partly because fewer Filipinos have purchased firecrackers due to hard economic times.\n\nOfficials have urged centralised fireworks displays to discourage wild and sometimes fatal merry-making. The notorious tradition, worsened by celebratory gunfire that turned deadly, stems from a Chinese-influenced belief that noise drives away evil and misfortune.\n\nJapan\n\nAt least nine people were injured, one seriously, when a driver deliberately ploughed his car into crowds celebrating New Year's Eve along a famous street in Japan's capital, Tokyo, according to police and media reports.\n\nWith an \"intent to murder\", a 21-year-old man drove a small vehicle into Takeshita Street in Tokyo's fashion district of Harajuku at 10 minutes past midnight (15:10 GMT on Monday), a police spokesperson told AFP news agency.\n\nThe driver, identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of arrested murder.\n\nAccording to national broadcaster NHK, he told police he was acting in \"retribution for the death penalty\" without giving more precise details.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nLeader Kim Jong Un will keep North Korea watchers busy on New Year's Day when he is expected to give his annual address laying out the country's priorities for the year ahead. The speech is often the best gauge of what the North Korean leadership is focused on and what tone it will take in its dealings with the outside world.\n\nKim's speech will be parsed carefully for clues about his thinking on denuclearisation talks with Washington and a second summit with US President Donald Trump, relations with South Korea, and North Korea's efforts to get out from under international sanctions as it tries to build its domestic economy.\n\nIn his New Year's speech this past year, Kim proposed talks with South Korea to reduce tensions and said the North would be willing to participate in South Korea's Winter Olympics, setting off a series of summits with the South and the United States.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nAfter an eventful year that saw three inter-Korean summits and the easing of tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme, South Koreans enter 2019 with hopes that the hard-won detente will expand into a stable peace.\n\nThousands of South Koreans were expected to fill the streets of the capital, Seoul, for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony near City Hall to usher in the new year.\n\nSeoul New City Hall - iArc Architects pic.twitter.com/pxjjdU1VFq \u2014 Architecture (@archpng) May 18, 2018\n\nDignitaries picked to ring the old Bosingak bell at midnight include famous surgeon Lee Guk-jong, who successfully operated on a North Korean soldier who escaped to South Korea in 2017 in a hail of bullets fired by his comrades.\n\nElsewhere, about 10,000 people were expected to attend the tolling of a \"peace bell\" at Imjingak, a pavilion near the border with North Korea.\n\nChina\n\nNew Year's Eve isn't celebrated that widely in mainland China, where the Lunar New Year in February is a more important holiday, but countdown events were being held in major cities and some of the faithful headed to Buddhist temples for bell-ringing and prayers.\n\nThe city of Beijing was holding a gala with VIP guests at the main site of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The event looked ahead to the 2022 Winter Games, which also will be held in the Chinese capital.\n\nAdditional police were deployed in parts of Shanghai, where a New Year's Eve stampede in 2014 killed 36 people. In Beijing, outdoor revelers had to brave temperatures well below freezing.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, in a message broadcast at the top of the evening news, outlined the country's achievements over the past year and said that by hosting a series of multinational meetings in 2018, \"we have put forward China's proposals and sent out China's voice.\"\n\nIn Hong Kong, festive lights on the city's iconic skyscrapers provided the backdrop for a fireworks, music and light show over Victoria Harbor on a chilly evening. About 300,000 people were expected to line the waterfront.\n\nThailand\n\nWhile many celebrate New Year's Eve with fireworks, hundreds of Thais travelled to Takien Temple in a suburb of Bangkok to lie inside coffins for traditional funeral rituals. Participants believe the ceremony - symbolising death and rebirth - helps rid them of bad luck and allows them to be born again for a fresh start in the new year.\n\nParticipants held flowers and incense in their hands as monks covered them with pink sheets and chanted prayers for the dead.\n\n\"It wasn't scary or anything. It is our belief that it will help us get rid of bad luck and bring good fortune to our life,\" said Busaba Yookong, who came to the temple with her family.\n\nBangkok is filled with modern glitzy malls and high-rise buildings, but superstitious beliefs still hold sway in many aspects of Thai society.\n\nBritain\n\nCities across Europe have also welcomed 2019 with a series of firework displays, including one in London that was dedicated to the EU citizens living in the British capital.\n\n\n\nThe words \"London is open\" were spoken in seven languages as the fireworks at the London Eye ferris wheel went off, while the soundtrack included the songs \"We Are Your Friends\", \"Stay\" and \"Don't Leave Me Alone\".\n\n\n\n\"By paying tribute to our close relationship with Europe as we welcome in the New Year tonight, we will once again show the world that London will always be open,\" Mayor Sadiq Khan said.\n\n\n\nThe London mayor has been vocal about how Britain's planned departure from the European Union on March 29 will affect his city.\n\nFrom Berlin to Athens\n\nFireworks also lit up the skies over the Brandenburg Gate in the German capital, Berlin, as well the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, where the names of this year's victorious French football World Cup-winning team were projected onto the landmark.\n\nSweden greeted the New Year with its annual tradition of a reading of Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \"Ring Out Wild Bells\", read this year by actor Mikael Persbrandt.\n\nIn the Russian capital, Moscow, the bells in the Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower rang out, but the party mood was dampened by a gas explosion at an apartment building in the southern city of Magnitogorsk. Dozens of people are still missing.\n\nIn Athens, where fireworks went off above the Acropolis despite pouring rain, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras promised that \"2019 will be a year of rebirth for our country.\"\n\nGreece, which has struggled with a financial crisis for the best part of a decade, officially exited its bailout programme in August.\n\nUnited States\n\nMeanwhile in the United States, about a million people counted down the seconds on rainy Times Square in New York City as they watched the traditional crystal ball drop.\n\nSnoop Dogg, Sting, Christina Aguilera and Bastille were among the performers welcoming 2019 in the made-for-TV extravaganza.\n\nHappy New Years Eve!

wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

He said while he and his 12-year-old daughter enjoyed this new rendition of Spiderman, he felt a bit ambivalent about its animated form. \u201cYou are given this cartoon version of Spiderman to accept this black face as Spiderman as opposed to having a real time, real place actor.\u201d\n\nHowever, Craig says, smaller, independent black movies with a political or cultural message that feature real-live actors have a greater chance of making it to production.\n\n\n\nTwo such films this year are Spike Lee\u2019s Blackkklansman, a dark satire based on a true story about an African-American cop infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan and If Beale Street Could Talk, a romantic drama about social injustice against blacks and incarceration of African-American men in 1970s America, by Oscar-winning filmmaker Barry Jenkins. Both films have been mentioned as Oscar contenders and share the spotlight in AFI\u2019s list of best films of the year.\n\n\n\nRoom for smaller films\n\nBut small black films by lesser-known filmmakers get little promotion and financial backing.

It advocates activism against the economic exploitation of \"Corporate America.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen art and organizing are married, then the art becomes a way for people to ruminate on what they can do and then they have a place to plug in,\" Riley told VOA. \"And then I think what happens is more artists are created from those movements.\" He says he doubts his film would have made it to production if he relied on Hollywood to get it funded. \u201cMaking your art is one thing and trying to get a job in what \u201cthey\u201d [the Hollywood Industry] want to happen is another. The reason I was able to make a film like I made was because I wasn\u2019t trying to get a job.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe advises young filmmakers without financial backing to use digital platforms to get their films out.\n\nIt took Boots Riley four years to get his film made. But Sorry to Bother You is a success story. The film cost a little bit over three million dollars to make and has grossed over twenty million dollars.\n\nThe Hate U Give, by filmmaker George Tillman, about a police shooting of an African-American teen in a black community, also went viral, despite the fact that it had gotten little promotion. Tillman said that was because the film offered an authentic depiction of African-Americans killed by police and its message of standing up for justice resonated with audiences all over the country.\n\nBoots Riley agrees that the overwhelmingly positive audience response towards thought-provoking African-American movies signals that black filmmakers can take charge of their narrative and film production.\n\n\n\n\"We have things to bring to the world that are not just changing the actors or changing the director,\" he says, \"and I think that black film can really start having its own stories.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "After Some Blockbusters, Have Black Films Entered Hollywood Mainstream?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/after-some-blockbusters-have-black-films-entered-hollywood-mainstream-/4723937.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "2018 was a year of box office successes and awards of artistic recognition for black films.

Elizabeth Warren on Monday took the first major step toward launching a widely anticipated campaign for the presidency, hoping her reputation as a populist fighter can help her navigate a Democratic field that could include nearly two dozen candidates.\n\n\u201cNo matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing,\u201d the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a video that highlights her family's history in Oklahoma. \u201cTo be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for and that's why today I'm launching an exploratory committee for president.\u201d\n\nWarren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections. She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.\n\nNow, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of color along with images of a women's march and Warren's participation at an LGBT event.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.\n\nWarren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move toward a presidential bid and has long been a favorite target of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.\n\nBut that's likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps toward White House runs.\n\nWarren enters a Democratic field that's shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens. One of her most significant competitors could be Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.\n\nShe must also move past a widely panned October release of a DNA test meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage. The move was intended to rebut Trump's taunts of Warren as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Instead, her use of a genetic test to prove ethnicity spurred controversy that seemed to blunt any argument she sought to make. There was no direct mention of it in the video released Monday.\n\nWarren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nShe now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year. She has an advantage in the $12.5 million left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run.\n\nWarren's campaign is likely to revolve around the same theme she's woven into speeches and policy proposals in recent years: battling special interests, paying mind to the nexus between racial and economic inequities.\n\n\u201cAmerica's middle class is under attack,\u201d Warren said in the video. \u201cHow did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie.

Graham suggested Trump may slow his planned 30-day withdrawal, but the White House has not commented on Graham's interpretation of his talks with Trump.\n\n\"I think we're in a pause situation where we are re-evaluating what's the best way to achieve the president's objective of having (other countries) pay more and do more\" in the war on terrorism, Graham said.\n\nIn his Monday tweets, Trump said, \"I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working.

He was disputing John Kelly, his outgoing White House chief of staff, who said in an interview over the weekend that the Trump administration discarded the idea of a \"solid concrete wall\" early in Trump's two-year tenure as president.\n\nBut Trump conceded, \"Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!\"\n\nTrump won the cheers of his most ardent loyalists in his successful 2016 presidential campaign with his call for a solid concrete wall along the 3,200-kilometer U.S.-Mexican border, claiming Mexico would pay for it.\n\nAs president, however, Trump has sought U.S. taxpayer funding, but Congress has balked, leading to the ongoing shutdown of a quarter of U.S. government operations, furloughing 800,000 government workers and forcing another 420,000 to work without pay.\n\nWATCH: Free Meals for Furloughed Workers\n\nThe shutdown is now in its 10th day with no end in sight, and likely extending past Thursday when a new Congress is seated, with opposition Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives from Trump's Republican Party.

Trump and Democratic lawmakers have not held any negotiations for days over the wall dispute.\n\nKelly told the Los Angeles Times, \"To be honest, it's not a wall. The president still says 'wall' \u2014 oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats.\"\n\nKelly added, \"But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\"\n\nIn a second Twitter remark, Trump said, \"I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an \u201cOpen Wound,\u201d where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here (and) fix now!\"\n\nWhite House officials said talks to resolve the border barrier funding impasse have broken off.\n\nTrump on Sunday tweeted that Democrats \"left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!\"\n\nDemocrats scoffed at the accusation.\n\n\"This is the same president who repeatedly promised the American people that Mexico would pay for the wall that he plans to build,\" New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said on ABC's This Week program. \"Now he's trying to extract $5 billion from the American taxpayer to pay for something that clearly would be ineffective.\"\n\n\"President Trump has taken hundreds of thousands of federal employees' pay hostage in a last ditch effort to fulfill a campaign promise,\" the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, tweeted. \"Building a wall from sea to shining sea won't make us safer or stop drugs from coming into our country.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, Trump again threatened to close the entire U.S.-Mexico border and cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if Congress failed to give him money to fund the wall. He also asked for changes in what he said was the United States' \"ridiculous immigration laws.\"\n\nClosing the U.S.-Mexican border would mean disrupting a $1.68 billion-a-day trade relationship between the two countries. In addition, immigrant advocates have called any move to seal the border \"disgraceful.\"\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Trump linked Democrats' \"pathetic immigration policies\" with the deaths of two Guatemalan children while in U.S. custody.\n\nHis comments, the first to reference the children's deaths, came the same day Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was finishing a two-day visit to the southern U.S. border, where she said in a statement, \"The system is clearly overwhelmed and we must work together to address this humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nTrump has declined to comment on whether he might accept less than $5 billion for wall funding. When asked how long he thought the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters, \"Whatever it takes.\"\n\nDemocrats have blamed Trump for \"plunging the country into chaos\" and have noted that Trump, before the partial work stoppage took effect, said he would be \"proud\" to \"own\" a shutdown over border wall funding."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Top US Senator Upbeat on Syria Troop Withdrawal After Trump Meeting", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-senator-upbeat-on-syria-troop-withdrawal-after-trump-meeting/4722032.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "A senior Republican U.S. senator said he emerged from a White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Sunday reassured that Trump is committed to defeating Islamic State even as he plans to withdraw American troops from Syria.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham had warned that removing all U.S. forces from Syria would hurt national security by allowing Islamic State to rebuild, betraying U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters of the YPG militia battling remnants of the militant group, and enhancing Iran's ability to threaten Israel.\n\nDuring a morning television interview, Graham said he would ask Trump to slow down the troop withdrawal, which was announced earlier this month and drew widespread criticism.\n\nAn ally of Trump, although he has opposed some of his foreign policy decisions, Graham was more upbeat after the meeting.\n\n\"We talked about Syria. He told me some things I didn't know that made me feel a lot better about where we're headed in Syria,\" Graham told reporters at the White House.\n\n\"We still have some differences but I will tell you that the president is thinking long and hard about Syria - how to withdraw our forces but at the same time achieve our national security interests,\" Graham said.\n\nAsked if Trump had agreed to any slowing down of the troop withdrawal, Graham said: \"I think the president's very committed to making sure that when we leave Syria, that ISIS is completely defeated.\u201d\n\nHe said Trump's trip to Iraq last week was an eye-opener and he understood the need to \"finish the job\" with Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\n\"I think the president has come up with a plan with his generals that makes sense to me,\" Graham said.

Nigeria hopes to reach that point in five years.\n\nAbout 39 million people between 9 months and 44 years old are expected to be vaccinated by the end of 2018.\n\nProgram manager for immunization in Abuja, Salome Toh, says the effort is having an impact.\n\n\"The federal government of Nigeria, in collaboration with international organizations, especially the GAVI, they have earmarked a lot of money in supporting this campaign.

So we just did a risk categorization, selected areas we feel that are most at risk and try to focus on them for the preventive campaign,\" Ezebilo said.\n\n\n\nThe Yellow fever virus is endemic in tropical areas and is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. As many as 60,000 Africans die annually from the disease. Children are most at risk.\n\nThere is no cure for the viral infection, but it can be prevented with the vaccine. Once someone contracts yellow fever, medical treatment consists of easing symptoms of the virus, which include fever, muscle pain and dehydration.\n\nGood sanitation, hygiene and proper drainage are natural ways to reduce risks of the disease.\n\n\n\nNigeria is one of 50 global partners battling to eliminate the disease within the next 10 years.\n\nBesides improving sanitation and clearing stagnant water where mosquitoes breed, Nigeria needs to immunize about 80 percent of the at-risk population to prevent further transmission of the disease."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Nigeria Targets 26M People in Yellow Fever Campaign", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4722520.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Nigeria's campaign to vaccinate more people against yellow fever appears to be making headway.

Neither of those is possible for South Korea unless sanctions are removed.\n\nSome analysts say North Korea has been trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul while putting the larger burden of action on the United States. Pyongyang over the past months has accused Washington of failing to take corresponding measures following the North\u2019s unilateral dismantlement of a nuclear testing ground and suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang are trying to arrange a second summit between Trump and Kim, who met in Singapore on June 12.\n\n\u201cIf the United States takes sincere measures and corresponding action to our leading and pre-emptive efforts, then [U.S.-North Korea] relations will advance at a fast and excellent pace through the process of implementing [such] definite and groundbreaking measures,\u201d said Kim, who delivered the speech sitting on a leather chair, wearing a black suit and gray-blue tie.\n\n\u201cIt is the unwavering position of our party and the republic\u2019s government and my firm will that the two countries as declared in the June 12 joint statement ... take steps to establish a permanent and stable peace regime and push toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we have already declared domestically and internationally and took various actions showing our commitment that we will no further create or test nuclear weapons and will not use or spread them.\u201d\n\nAdam Mount, a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said Kim appears to be hinting at an agreement that falls short of a full disarmament, but could still represent a major limitation of the North Korean threat \u2014 a cap that essentially freezes the North\u2019s rudimentary nuclear capability from growing or advancing further. In exchange, the United States would have to offer major inducements, including sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cU.S. negotiators should move decisively in the new year to find out how far Kim is willing to go toward a verified cap on his arsenal. Discussions on reducing or eliminating that arsenal come later,\u201d Mount said in an email.\n\nHowever, Kim\u2019s statement could prove problematic if there\u2019s ongoing evidence the North\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities continue to run. Private analysts have accused North Korea of continuing nuclear and missile development, citing details from commercial satellite imagery.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, signs of continued work on the arsenal were alarming but not duplicitous, because there was never a commitment to stop those activities,\u201d Mount said. \u201cThat may no longer be true, raising the risk that the White House feels cheated rather than just stonewalled.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s speech also points toward a difficult year for the U.S.-South Korean alliance with their military cooperation coming under pressure from Pyongyang, Seoul\u2019s process for inter-Korean engagement, and Washington\u2019s current inability to reach an agreement on cost-sharing for the U.S. military presence in South Korea. It will be critical for the allies to develop a firmer policy as it\u2019s clear the issue of joint drills is coming to a head, Mount said.\n\nIn the speech, Kim hailed the results of the North\u2019s diplomatic activities in 2018, including his three meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim said an inter-Korean military agreement reached in their last summit in September to reduce conventional military threats was \u201crealistically a non-aggression declaration.\u201d\n\nKim also emphasized the development of the North Korean economy and, without elaborating, mentioned nuclear power as part of the country\u2019s plans to boost electricity production.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government in a statement welcomed what it described as Kim\u2019s commitment toward peace and said Seoul plans to work closely with the international community for the denuclearization of the peninsula while also advancing inter-Korean relations to an \u201cirreversible level.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean leaders traditionally use New Year\u2019s statements to issue major policy goals for the year ahead. Kim used his New Year\u2019s speech a year ago to start a newfound diplomatic approach with Seoul and Washington, which led to his meetings with Moon and Trump. Kim also met three times with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which boosted his leverage by reintroducing Beijing \u2014 Pyongyang\u2019s main ally \u2014 as a major player in the diplomatic process to resolve the nuclear standoff.\n\nBut nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled in recent months as they struggle with the sequencing of North Korea\u2019s disarmament and the removal of U.S.-led sanctions against the North.\n\nThe North has also bristled at U.S. demands to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal.\n\nThe hardening stalemate has fueled doubts on whether Kim will ever voluntarily relinquish the nuclear weapons and missiles he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. In his meetings with Trump and Moon, Kim signed vague statements calling for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. The North used a blunt statement last month to reiterate its traditional stance on denuclearization, saying it will never unilaterally give up its weapons unless Washington removes what Pyongyang describes as a nuclear threat.\n\nThe statement jarred with Seoul\u2019s claim that Kim is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nukes and suggested that the North will potentially demand the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a major sticking point in any disarmament deal."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Watch Countries Around The World Celebrate New Year's Eve 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-years-eve-2018-around-the-world_us_5c2a4000e4b08aaf7a92aa41", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "People the world over are finding festive ways to usher in the 2019 new year, as the Gregorian calendar\u2019s 2018 year comes to a close at midnight on Dec. 31.\n\nMany cities will use fireworks to celebrate the new year with a bang.

The funds were provided as part of a federal contract to use Etowah County Detention Center to hold hundreds of undocumented immigrants who face federal legal proceedings over their immigration status and any alleged crimes.\n\nIn addition, Entrekin also admitted at a news conference in early 2018 that he kept $750,000 in food funds from 2015 to 2017. He purchased a beach house valued at $740,000 soon after, The Birmingham News reported.\n\nAlabama state law allows sheriffs to keep unspent money allocated for inmate food. The Southern Center for Human Rights says that the policy \u201cinvites public corruption.\u201d Critics say the state law allowing sheriffs to pocket taxpayer funds should not apply to federal money.\n\nAL.com, which includes The Birmingham News, The Huntsville Times and Mobile\u2019s Press-Register, discovered Entrekin\u2019s $1.5 federal windfall in a search of hundreds of pages of county and sheriff\u2019s office records. Entrekin, who earns close to a $100,000 salary, turned over an additional $1.5 million during that time to Etowah County\u2019s general fund for use on a variety of local needs, reported AL.com.\n\nA local official confirmed that it\u2019s routine for Entrekin and the county to split any unspent federal funds.\n\n\u201cWith the ICE funds, the money comes in here, we show all the salaries that are paid ... and the different expenses that are paid for ICE that we\u2019re required to show,\u201d county Chief Administration Officer David Akins told AL.com. \u201cAt the bottom line, say if we had $100,000 [left] at the end of the year, then the [county] commission should get $50,000 and the sheriff would get $50,000.\u201d\n\nICE could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nEntrekin told the News in 2018: \u201cThe law says [food funds are] a personal account and that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always done it.\u201d Not all Alabama counties allow the practice. Entrekin runs the only country facility holding hundreds of immigrant inmates for the federal government.\n\nEntrekin lost the GOP primary for sheriff in June and will leave his job in January. He blames news coverage of his beach house purchase for his loss.\n\nFederal rates for housing undocumented immigrants vary from state to state. Immigrants likely to be incarcerated for long periods of time because of complicated cases tend to be sent to the cheapest places, such as Alabama, according to AL.com.\n\nInmates have complained about spoiled food served past expiration dates, and kitchen workers have confirmed that food is often rotten, reported AL.com. In one case, food collected in a train wreck was fed to inmates to save federal money that the sheriff and county could then pocket.\n\nInmate advocates have also complained about poor medical care and a lack of outdoor recreation at the Etowah County Detention Center.\n\nThe law allowing sheriffs to pocket unspent food funds was at the center of a 2018 lawsuit filed by the Southern Center for Human Rights and the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. Forty-nine Alabama country sheriffs were sued over their refusal to produce public records revealing their take of funds allocated to feed inmates."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Sandra Bullock's New Netflix Movie Inspires People To Take 'Bird Box' Challenge", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bird-box-challenge-sandra-bullock-netflix_us_5c2aa863e4b05c88b702f83b", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "It looks like the old year is ending with a new meme.\n\nFans inspired by \u201cBird Box,\u201d Sandra Bullock\u2019s Netflix horror hit, have started attempting something called the #BirdBoxChallenge.\n\nThe task requires participants to attempt to do things blindfolded like Bullock\u2019s character in the film.\n\nThere is a slight difference: In \u201cBird Box,\u201d characters wear the blindfolds as protection against an unseen force that seemingly takes over people\u2019s vision by manifesting their greatest fears.\n\nIn the #BirdBoxChallenge, people wear the blindfolds in hopes of going viral.\n\nOne version of the meme shows a blindfolded family paddling for dear life in their bathtub while another features a group of women trying to use an escalator with their eyes covered, according to Inside Edition.\n\nSome other examples posted on social media so far:"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump To Skip Mar-a-Lago Party With Guests Who Paid $1,000 Each To See Him", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-party-for-trump_us_5c2aa018e4b0407e9085410b", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Mar-a-Lago\u2019s $1,000-a-ticket New Year\u2019s Eve party was left without its featured attraction on Monday, when club owner President Donald Trump remained in Washington because of the government shutdown he created over a border wall he had promised Mexico would pay for.\n\nTrump had planned to spend both Christmas and New Year\u2019s at his for-profit Mar-a-Lago resort, as he has done for years. Instead, he canceled his 16-day golfing vacation and spent the final day of 2018 at the White House, posting angry tweets about Democrats, who are refusing to agree to spend billions of taxpayer dollars for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nWhat else Trump did at the White House on Monday, apart from watching television, is not readily apparent. The White House press office stopped disseminating his public schedule two weeks ago and did not respond to HuffPost queries about Trump\u2019s activities.\n\nSince the shutdown, Trump has been blaming Democrats. Nevertheless, it was the president himself who brought about the partial government shutdown by reneging on his agreement to sign a short-term spending bill to fund the quarter of the federal government that wasn\u2019t covered by earlier bills he had already signed into law.\n\nTrump reversed course after Fox News and radio talk show hosts ridiculed him for caving on his campaign promise to build a border wall. Trump insisted the new spending plan include $5 billion for the wall \u2014 even though he had promised hundreds of times during his campaign that his \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall would not cost Americans anything because he would force Mexico to pay for it.\n\nThat left some 800,000 federal government employees in paycheck limbo. About half were furloughed when funding for their agencies ran out at midnight Dec. 21; the other half were deemed \u201cessential\u201d and forced to work anyway. None will receive another paycheck until Trump has signed a bill resuming funding.\n\nWhen that might take place is unclear. Trump has vowed he will not accept any measure that does not include billions for his wall \u2014 although the precise nature of that wall is now unknown \u2014 while Democrats say they are not interested in spending U.S. taxpayer money on a project Trump had promised he would make Mexico finance.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nRepublicans still control both the House and Senate, but Trump has focused his attacks on Democrats. Because Republicans only have 51 seats in the Senate, they need at least nine Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation in that chamber.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 position only gets stronger on Thursday, when California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi is set to become the next speaker after her party picked up 40 seats and control of the House in the November midterm elections.\n\nHer plan is to pass a spending package of bills that already cleared the Senate appropriations committee to provide full-year funding for most of the affected agencies, and also a two-month extension for the Department of Homeland Security. The idea of a short-term extension for all of the unfunded agencies was considered so uncontroversial that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought it to the floor for a voice vote, where it passed unanimously on Dec. 19.\n\nThose votes of approval from Senate Republicans, though, will carry no weight with McConnell now, a top aide said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won\u2019t sign,\u201d said Don Stewart.\n\nShould McConnell refuse to take up those bills after the Democratic House passes them, that will prove he is merely a rubber stamp for Trump and his whims, Democrats said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Guilt Trips America In Self-Pitying 'Happy New Year' Video", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-new-years-eve-tweet-guilt-trip_us_5c2ab6e5e4b05c88b702fad5", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "President Trump is known for spinning lies \u2015 lots and lots of lies \u2015 but now he\u2019s adding mixed messages to his verbal arsenal.\n\nOn Monday, the president sent out a New Year\u2019s greeting on Twitter that managed to pack lots of self-pity and passive-aggression into an 11-second clip.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m at the White House working, you\u2019re out there partying tonight.

The union said withholding the pay of workers who continue to clock in during the shutdown runs afoul of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Great Depression-era law establishing a minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\n\u201cThis is not an acceptable way for any employer, let alone the U.S. government, to treat its employees,\u201d Heidi Burakiewicz, a lawyer representing the workers, said in a statement. \u201cThese employees still need to pay childcare expenses, buy gas, and incur other expenses to go to work every day and yet, they are not getting paid.

But in the meantime, all those workers have bills to pay. Those who don\u2019t have deep enough savings will face some hard choices if the shutdown continues to grind on.\n\nAFGE previously sued the government under the same claims after the 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days. A judge later ruled that around 25,000 workers were owed double pay due to damages.\n\nUnlike that earlier shutdown, the ongoing one affects only about one-quarter of federal functions, as Congress has already appropriated money for the rest.

Back then, as an anxious teenager crying in my doctor\u2019s office, I had no idea that they would become such an integral part of my life.\n\nI spent a long time wrestling with my need for medication. But you can have as much therapy as you can handle and self-care yourself silly, but for some people, nothing gets rid of that big black cloud \u2014 or at least lifts it enough that you can take a breath \u2014 like a daily pill.\n\nTaking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for clinical depression on a long-term basis wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly, and at various stages I\u2019ve stopped taking them. Maybe my mental health was good and I wanted to see how I got on without the meds. At other times, I succumbed to the stigma and bowed to the pressure inflicted \u2014 be it intentional or not \u2014 by people who proudly declared, \u201cI had depression and got through it without medication!\u201d\n\nThere are a ton of other reasons someone might quit their antidepressants, for example if they couldn\u2019t handle the side effects (commonly reported ones include decreased libido, headaches, insomnia, drowsiness, or simply not feeling like yourself), didn\u2019t think they were working (up to a third of people have treatment-resistant, or refractory, depression), or simply struggled to meet the expense of long-term meds.\n\nAfter several rounds of trial and error, I\u2019ve accepted them as part of my life, and an essential component in my self-care toolkit.\n\nEach time, I ended up back on the medication anyway. Finally, after several rounds of trial and error, I\u2019ve accepted them as part of my life, and an essential component in my self-care toolkit. I also know a few things about what happens when you stop taking them.\n\nThis is an aspect of taking antidepressants I was never told about, despite seeing numerous doctors and working my way through various types of SSRIs. Yes, it\u2019s all there in the small print inside the pill packet, but small print was the last thing I wanted to deal with when simply getting out of bed in the morning was my own personal Everest.\n\nWhat happens when you stop taking antidepressants is commonly referred to as \u201cwithdrawal\u201d symptoms, but this isn\u2019t entirely accurate, according to Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, and author of The Power of Different.\n\n\u201cWithdrawal is a craving for a drug, plus physical symptoms,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhat happens when you stop an antidepressant is known as a discontinuation syndrome, due to the sudden loss of serotonin and/or norepinephrine that had been boosted in the brain by the medication.\u201d\n\nThe first time I stopped taking antidepressants, I followed my doctor\u2019s advice. Over six weeks, I gradually reduced my dose (known as tapering). Initially, I didn\u2019t feel great, but I didn\u2019t feel lousy, either. I had a bit of a headache, nausea, insomnia, and zero energy. A few weeks after stopping my meds completely, I noticed that my anxiety had ramped up, and my low days were more frequent than they had been in a long time. I figured this was an adjustment period, but I was wrong. I was relapsing into depression.\n\nThree months later, I was back on my meds.\n\nIt turns out that some symptoms of discontinuation syndrome \u2014 aside from physical symptoms not commonly found in depression, such as dizziness, flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches, pains, nausea, and abnormal sensations \u2014 can resemble a relapse. However, discontinuation symptoms typically appear very soon after stopping the meds or reducing the dose, whereas relapse symptoms develop later and more gradually.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re more likely to experience discontinuation symptoms if you\u2019ve been taking a certain class of antidepressant, such as an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or a shorter-acting SSRI, like paroxetine (Paxil) or sertraline (Zoloft).\n\nDr. Saltz says tapering slowly makes discontinuation syndrome far less likely to happen, but every time I\u2019ve stopped or reduced my meds through tapering, I\u2019ve still experienced symptoms of discontinuation to some extent.\n\nAnd then there was the time I just ... stopped. No tapering. In my defense, it wasn\u2019t intentional. I was traveling to France with my two young children. I had packed everything we needed for our two-week vacation. Our cases bulged with swimwear, sandals, books, and all manner of things to keep the little people entertained. It wasn\u2019t until I started to unpack, 1,200 miles from home, that I realized something vital was missing from my wash bag.\n\nI arrived home feeling as if all the steps forward I took while I was on medication had been erased from my history; I had taken an enormous leap backward.\n\nSome might say everything\u2019s easier when the out-of-office is turned on and the sun is shining. This doesn\u2019t apply to a sudden stopping of antidepressants. And there was nothing I could do about it but power on through.\n\nThe next week was a blur. I remember crazy dreams, feelings of despair, fear and paranoia, anxiety, tremors, dizziness, and the strangest sensations I\u2019ve ever experienced. I call them \u201cbrain zaps\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re like tiny electric shocks in my brain. I\u2019d had them to a lesser extent during previous (planned) periods of tapering, but this time round they were as unrelenting as the French Riviera midday sun.\n\nApparently, these are caused by an abrupt change in the level of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that attach to receptors on the nerve cells) in the brain, and they\u2019re generally not medically dangerous. But they\u2019re uncomfortable as hell.\n\nI arrived home feeling as if all the steps forward I took while I was on medication had been erased from my history; I had taken an enormous leap backward. I was back to where I started.\n\nI learned an important lesson after that trip. I\u2019ve never forgotten to pack my meds since.\n\nHere\u2019s the main thing I know about coming off antidepressants: it\u2019s a complex process, and it affects everyone differently. It\u2019s up to you when \u2014 or if \u2014 to stop taking antidepressants, but never do it without speaking to your doctor first. In my experience, tapering makes it bearable; stopping suddenly is never going to go well. Don\u2019t quit your meds unless you feel confident that your mental health is good, that you\u2019re functioning well, and that you have the tools and support system to cope with any negative thoughts that might crop up. It\u2019s not a good idea to quit while you\u2019re feeling stressed or going through a major life change, or if you\u2019re only doing it to keep other people happy (perhaps you should quit those people, instead of the meds).\n\nAlso, be aware of the difference between discontinuation syndrome and relapse. And try to stay open-minded, whatever path you take. Some people only need to take antidepressants for a few months; while others do so for several years.\n\nFinally, always, always, remember to pack your pills for your vacation."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Do You Really Know What's In Your Tampons?

Kimberly-Clark, Kotex\u2019s parent company, said in a press release it received \u201ca small number of reports of infections, vaginal irritation, localized vaginal injury, and other symptoms\u201d and that in some cases consumers had to seek medical attention \u201cto remove tampon pieces left in the body.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there is no federal or state law requiring Kotex, or any other menstrual hygiene company, to share the ingredients \u2014 including the chemicals \u2014 that make up its products. This is a problem, says Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic member of the New York state Assembly. When tampons are falling apart inside people\u2019s bodies, she told HuffPost, doctors should be able to know how to treat these patients. But they\u2019ll struggle to do it if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the problem, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd who knows what the long-term effects are?\u201d Rosenthal asked in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s case in point for why we need ingredient labeling on products people put inside their body.\u201d\n\nRosenthal is sponsoring legislation in New York to require ingredient labeling on the packaging of all menstrual products sold in the state. The Assembly is expected to consider the bill in 2019; if it passes, it will be the first law of its kind in the United States.\n\nManufacturers might list some, but not all, ingredients on feminine hygiene packaging or on their products\u2019 websites.\n\nIn a letter to Kimberly-Clark, the Assembly member asked the company to \u201cpublicly disclose the chemicals present in these products so that menstruators can work with their health care providers to properly manage risks associated with exposure.\u201d She has yet to receive a response.\n\nBrett Carlsen via Getty Images Linda Rosenthal of the New York state Assembly wants to make it mandatory for tampon companies to disclose the ingredients they use in their products.\n\nRosenthal isn\u2019t alone in her fight. In 2017, for example, the Menstrual Products Right to Know Act was introduced in Congress, though it later stalled.\n\n\u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said. She fears these products contains an array of chemicals that \u201cmore and more people are becoming sensitive to.\u201d\n\nA recent study commissioned by the organization Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth detected chemicals like carbon disulfide, a known reproductive toxin, and methylene chloride, a potential occupational carcinogen, in popular tampon brands. These ingredients are not disclosed on product packaging. (WVE, it should be noted, partners with two menstrual product brands, Seventh Generation and Natracare, both of which appeared free of chemicals in the testing.)\n\nThis is not the only study on menstrual products and potential contaminants, but research into the topic is limited. There are also conflicting opinions on what is considered \u201csafe\u201d when it comes to the levels of chemicals in these products. Trace amounts of dioxin, a chemical that has been associated with endometriosis, have been deemed \u201csafe\u201d by the Food and Drug Administration, The New York Times reported in 2017. Manufacturers are required to assess the dioxin levels in their products on their own, and then provide the FDA with their results.\n\nSome experts worry that the harmfulness of dioxin could be greater than is widely assumed. Carolyn Nygaard, a naturopathic physician, told The Guardian in 2016 that she is unsure of the chemical\u2019s effects on women\u2019s health over time, and isn\u2019t confident the FDA considers this. Women menstruate for up to 40 years, Nygaard told The Guardian, wearing up to 20 tampons once a month, 13 times a year. \u201cSo there is the potential to have cumulative effects from that,\u201d she said. The vaginal membrane is more absorptive than skin on other parts of the body, which raises specific concerns around chemicals like dioxin in products meant to be inserted vaginally, the publication noted.\n\nPhotographyFirm via Getty Images \u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said.\n\nRosenthal is a pioneer in fronting legislation for fair treatment of people who menstruate.\n\nIn March 2018, she introduced the Total Access to Menstrual Products Act to the Assembly. The TAMP Act would require all female-designated bathrooms in the state of New York to provide hygiene products at no cost.\n\n\u201cToilet paper is assumed in every bathroom,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cWhy should there not be products to help half the population deal with their biological function? It doesn\u2019t make sense. If you can expect toilet paper, you should be able to expect menstrual products.\u201d\n\nRosenthal also helped spearhead a bill that would require state correctional facilities to provide incarcerated people with menstrual products at no cost. The bill passed.\n\nUltimately, Rosenthal said, laws relating to menstrual health will help to reduce the stigma and shame that surrounds the topic.\n\nThe fight for these types of legal actions underscores how desperately we need more women in power, Rosenthal added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "California Cities Struggle To Help Minorities Build Marijuana Businesses", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cannabis-marijuana-equity-minority_us_5c264859e4b04aa0a171b8ac", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Scott Rodd for The Pew Charitable Trusts Alexis Bronson smells one of his latest cannabis \u201cclone\u201d plants, a specialty strain. Bronson is a participant in Oakland, California\u2019s \u201cpot equity\u201d program, but he says the program so far has failed to deliver on many of its promises.\n\nBy Scott Rodd\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 During the 1980s and \u201990s, Alexis Bronson\u2019s illegal cannabis delivery business could barely keep up with demand.\n\nIn the spring, Bronson made weekly trips to the redwood forests of Humboldt County to buy marijuana wholesale from renegade growers with farms hidden in the hills of Northern California. Bronson would wrap 5 or 10 pounds of marijuana in a plastic garbage bag, tuck it into the trunk of his rental car, and head south on Highway 101 to his hometown of Oakland.\n\nHe would buy a pound of marijuana for $1,500 to $1,800 and resell it for nearly triple that amount in Oakland in the 1980s, Bronson said.\n\nBut the lucrative business came with serious risks. Bronson exercised caution about where and when he delivered his product, avoiding traditional street-corner exchanges. It was the war on drugs era, and police worked swiftly to round up dealers and buyers under the mandate to crack down on drug activity.\n\nNow, as more states legalize recreational marijuana and the federal government moves away from incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders, several cities in California are trying to atone for decades of drug enforcement that fell disproportionately upon minorities.\n\nThey\u2019ve created what are known as cannabis equity programs, meant to welcome more minority and low-income entrepreneurs into the now-legal industry.\n\nThe programs provide business development, loan assistance and mentorships to eligible owners. Hundreds have applied in the past year. But \u201cpot equity\u201d has struggled with growing waiting lists, and some participants allege that the programs aren\u2019t fair to the people they\u2019re meant to be helping.\n\nCities such as Oakland have created incubator programs that pair an established marijuana company, called a non-equity business, with an equity cannabis business \u2014 run by an entrepreneur whose background might otherwise make it hard to get into the pot industry.\n\nThe goal of \u201ccannabis equity\u201d is to lower the barriers to entry into the legal cannabis industry for people who were disproportionately impacted by the criminalization of marijuana. The programs base eligibility on a variety of factors, including marijuana convictions, residency in a heavily policed district and income.\n\nToday, several city partnership programs require that established, non-equity businesses provide an equity business with space for several years rent-free. In exchange, the non-equity company receives faster processing for city approvals.\n\nCities such as Sacramento plan to waive up to tens of thousands of dollars in application and permit fees for eligible cannabis businesses.\n\nBut pot equity has struggled to get going. Understaffing in San Francisco\u2019s cannabis office has left a growing waiting list of applicants, and the city doesn\u2019t expect to begin approving businesses until sometime in 2019, said Nicole Elliott, director of San Francisco\u2019s Office of Cannabis.\n\nSome applicants argue that the waiting period has allowed other businesses to get an unfair head start. In Oakland, some pot equity businesses claim their incubator partners never followed through on the requirement to provide them with business development assistance or a space to operate.\n\nBronson, an African-American, now owns one of those equity businesses.\n\nScott Rodd for The Pew Charitable Trusts Early stage cannabis \u201cclone\u201d plants in Alexis Bronson\u2019s Oakland business incubator space. Two previous incubator partners under Oakland, California\u2019s \u201cpot equity\u201d program failed to deliver on their promises, but a third partnership has shown signs of success for Bronson.\n\nAlthough Bronson was never convicted of a cannabis-related crime, his income and residency made him eligible for Oakland\u2019s program.\n\nBut two partner businesses have failed to provide him with promised incubator space, he said. In the meantime, one of Bronson\u2019s state business permits has expired, and he continues to take on debt to keep the existing portion of his business afloat.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t right, because they got their head start,\u201d Bronson said of his partner businesses, who received their expedited processing from the city. \u201cEveryone got what they wanted except for me.\u201d\n\nLasting effects\n\nBetween 1980 and 2010, the number of inmates in federal prisons for drug offenses increased from about 4,700 to nearly 98,000, according to the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy 2016, that number had dropped to about 82,000 as more offenders were being routed through less-punitive drug courts and a growing number of states were decriminalizing marijuana.\n\nAfrican-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite similar rates of usage, according to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn Oakland, African-Americans make up about 30 percent of the population but 77 percent of the people arrested on marijuana charges, according to 2015 data collected by the city and used to establish the equity program.\n\nBeyond the immediate potential consequences of conviction and imprisonment, a drug arrest can have lasting effects. In a 2017 report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified nearly 650 collateral impacts for people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, including limited opportunities for certain professional licenses, education and government assistance.\n\nTo mitigate those effects, the state\u2019s recreational marijuana law allows for clearing or re-sentencing people who were convicted of cannabis-related crimes. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that requires the state Department of Justice to identify and send such convictions to county district attorneys to clear or re-sentence.\n\nDesley Brooks, the outgoing Oakland city councilwoman who helped create its equity program, said few entrepreneurs from low-income and minority communities would have a shot at entering the recreational cannabis industry without the program.\n\n\u201cSo many African-Americans sat \u2014 and continue to sit \u2014 in jail for cannabis offenses as a result of the war on drugs,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t set up a structure to address that, I would have been doing an injustice to many people who were harmed by the system.\u201d\n\nCreating a program to atone for decades of unjust policing \u2014 on top of building the framework for a newly legal cannabis industry \u2014 is no easy task.\n\nOakland is setting up a $3 million fund to provide additional capital assistance to pot equity businesses, Brooks said, but it remains unclear when the fund will become available.\n\nSlow start in San Francisco\n\nSan Francisco applicants have raised the same issue, Elliott said. The office set up an investment fund to provide financial assistance to cannabis businesses, such as low-interest loans. But the city has yet to allocate money to the fund, Elliott said.\n\nShe said San Francisco will likely receive part of the $10 million that the state set aside for local cannabis equity programs in September, which could go toward the city\u2019s cannabis investment fund.\n\n\u201cThere are equity applicants that need money now,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe will advocate aggressively for that state funding.\u201d\n\nAs of mid-December, San Francisco had 227 applicants that qualify for the equity program. Of those, about 110 want to join the city\u2019s incubator partnership program receive permits with waived fees.\n\nElliott said the city will begin approving applicants next year, but she could not say when. Applicants have criticized the lengthy timeline.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Office of Cannabis, which just added two new staff members to bring the total to five, is tasked with reviewing permit applications and facilitating the equity program. Elliott said adding even more staff would speed things up.\n\nIn the meantime, the city has established a partnership with the Bar Association of San Francisco to provide pro bono legal assistance to equity program participants.\n\nMalcolm Mirage, an equity applicant in San Francisco, said the long wait has caused him to burn through capital at an alarming rate. He partnered with MedMen, a household name in the cannabis industry that is publicly traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange.\n\nMedMen agreed to provide business development aid and an incubation space for one of Mirage\u2019s businesses. The company also helped him negotiate leases on two other spaces, and he struck a deal that gave him six months of free rent while he obtains permits to become operational.\n\nMirage figured that was plenty of time. But those six months came and went, and he\u2019s now paying expensive leases on spaces that sit empty."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "It\u2019s OK That I Don\u2019t Drink.

I have never been hungover, and though I\u2019m from Spain, where socializing inevitably involves alcohol, I\u2019m able to have a fun time and even go out until 7 in the morning without feeling the need to drink. My choice not to drink is a personal one, but in my opinion, it\u2019s a healthy choice that should be celebrated.\n\nYet when someone offers me a glass of wine and I refuse it, I attract curious looks and quite a few unsettling reactions. From total strangers asserting that I must be a very boring person to PR reps flat-out asking me if I am a recovering addict, it is somehow socially acceptable to put someone on the spot for not drinking.\n\nI was a teenager when I realized that drinking was truly not worth it for me. At age 14, I developed severe gastritis due to a Helicobacter pylori infection, and while I was under treatment I had to stick to a very mild diet and absolutely no alcohol. So when most of my friends starting going out on the weekends and binge-drinking to have fun, I had to find a way to be a part of the group without jeopardizing my health.\n\nIf there is any silver lining to being sick because someone prepared a contaminated meal, it was that I didn\u2019t develop a taste for alcohol.\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t want to be cut out of the group or considered a party pooper. If you think your teenage years were confusing, add to the mix having to pretend that you drink. Was there vodka at the party? I would refuse it under the pretense that only rum gave me a nice buzz. Were my friends bringing in their own alcohol? I would bring my flask, which happened to be filled with a watered-down syrup that smelled so strong it could pass for alcohol.\n\nAt some point, I realized there was no point in pretending to be cool. I found a new group of friends who understood that I simply couldn\u2019t drink, and made sure there were plenty of soft drinks on hand when we went out until the early hours of the morning.\n\nIt took me three years to recover from the H. pylori infection and its aftermath. By age 17, I had never been drunk, the few liquors I had ever tried felt like they were burning my insides raw, and I realized that alcohol tastes bad. My logical conclusion was that I was better off being sober. I had managed to go through my teenage years in absolute sobriety and still had a fun group of friends and a cute boyfriend, so my understanding was that the adult world would be a bit more mature about my choice.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nFast-forward to last year\u2019s New York Fashion Week. I was invited to a fun afternoon event because I was covering several shows. After being greeted by the hostess, the PR rep for the brand approached me and my friend and offered us something to drink. My friend went for wine, and I asked for a soft drink. She said they didn\u2019t have soft drinks, but that I could choose between four varieties of wine and vodka. I said that a glass of water would be fine then.\n\nOh, the look on her face. She started grilling me with questions about why I didn\u2019t want the other beverage choices. I calmly stated that I just don\u2019t drink alcohol.\n\n\u201cI see, you are a recovering alcoholic!\u201d she practically yelled.\n\nSober people don\u2019t owe you any explanation whatsoever for our perfectly valid choice.\n\nTo this day, I still cannot understand what made her think it was OK to scream what to some people is very private information out loud in a public setting. After three decades of sobriety and 10 in the industry, I truly didn\u2019t see that one coming.\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg. Early in my career, my bosses decided that the whole office had to participate in a compulsory team-building exercise for the holidays. Fair enough. Their poison of choice? A wine-tasting evening.\n\nI calmly explained that I would gladly go, but given the fact that I don\u2019t drink, I wouldn\u2019t actually partake in the actual tasting portion. The head of the office mumbled something about me being a killjoy. At the actual event, the workshop leader spent half the time trying to force me to drink the damn wine.\n\nAre you getting the picture of what it means to be sober in a social context? Merry Christmas to me.\n\nThe truth is that sobriety, like drinking alcohol, is just another personal choice. Very much like going on a vegan diet, playing sports, recycling or picking a career. I don\u2019t drink, but I don\u2019t mind if you, my friends, my family or my work colleagues drink. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nSo why does my sobriety make people around me so uncomfortable that they grill me with questions to try to understand why I would prefer to stick with a soft drink while everyone else is binging on the open bar? Although I very much wish to answer that it\u2019s really none of their f**king business, social conventions again demand that I graciously explain the many reasons I don\u2019t like alcohol. I\u2019m just tired of this sober-shaming nonsense. I have never been drunk; get over it.\n\nThe truth is that you don\u2019t know what is happening in a person\u2019s life when you decide to ask why someone doesn\u2019t drink. A person can be sober for many different reasons. The cute guy might be the designated driver for the night. The blonde in the red dress might be in the early stages of a much-desired pregnancy. That person you just met might be waiting for a liver transplant. The fun guy at the office might be in recovery after a long battle with alcoholism and your question might jeopardize the entire process. That girl at the party might be following a religious practice. And so on and so forth.\n\nStop being the alcohol police. Sober people don\u2019t owe you any explanation whatsoever for our perfectly valid choice. So if you are throwing a party or hosting a holiday gathering, please practice true hospitality by having an assortment of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, and leaving your guests alone to drink or not drink as they please."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

In one ominous sign, the federal Office of Personnel Management has posted a sample letter for mortgage companies and creditors on its website, giving guidance to federal employees on how to negotiate reduced payments.\n\nDemocrats say their proposed measures would create a month of breathing space for the president to negotiate with them. But Mr. Trump would lose much of his leverage in the border fight if he accepts their terms.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 two-pronged plan will also complicate life for Mr. McConnell, who has said he will not bring up any measure that does not have the president\u2019s support.

Giuliani, faulted the presumptive incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, for leaving for Hawaii while the government was partly shuttered. They blamed Democrats for not reaching out to forge a compromise.\n\n\u201cThose who have completely walked away from the table are doing no justice to the people of this country,\u201d Ms. Conway said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday morning.\n\nPeople close to Mr. Trump consider his statement about owning a shutdown regrettable. But White House officials and others close to the president also believe that a shutdown is unlikely to help Ms. Pelosi as she takes over as part of the new House majority, and that Democratic officials risk looking unreasonable.\n\nPelosi allies say that they think the shutdown will help her look like the adult in the room, because she is going to quickly move to end it, demonstrating that Democrats are serious about governing.\n\nMs. Conway did not rule out a presidential veto of the bill the House Democrats plan to advance.\n\n\u201cIt depends what\u2019s in it,\u201d she said.\n\nSenator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the Senate would not take up the House bill unless Mr. Trump backed it.

They were also notable given Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence for most of his term that the border would have a wall, not the \u201csteel slat barrier\u201d he has pivoted toward in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not a wall,\u201d Mr. Kelly told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nMr. Kelly, whose last day in his role is Monday, said he had sought advice from Customs and Border Protection officials early in 2017, when he was the homeland security secretary.

But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t go to Washington to work for them.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks before a pack of cameras, Ms. Warren shrugged at a question about how she had handled the release of her DNA test, reiterating that she had \u201cput it all out there\u201d and people could see the information for themselves.\n\nShe also took a revealing warning shot at the emerging field of presidential hopefuls. \u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they\u2019re spending,\u201d she said. \u201cDemocrats are the party of the people.\u201d\n\nAmong grass-roots activists eager to highlight their message of a rigged economic system, there was particular excitement that a video released by Ms. Warren on Monday focused on issues like income inequality and corporate greed. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said that \u201cElizabeth Warren meets the moment,\u201d and Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the leftist group Justice Democrats, said Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cmessage of multiracial populism is exactly the right way to take on Trump\u2019s divide-and-conquer agenda.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "2020 Democratic Presidential Candidates Are Lining Up.

Mr. Sanders ended up filling the void on the populist left and ran a surprisingly strong campaign against Hillary Clinton.\n\nMs. Warren was hardly the first White House hopeful to risk waiting. Bill Clinton, for example, opted out of the 1988 campaign and still became president four years later.\n\nBut the more recent history of presidential calculations suggests that candidates are wiser to run when the moment presents itself. That is what Mr. Obama did in 2008 after just four years in the Senate, the same period Ms. Warren would have served by 2016. Some Democrats think 2020 is Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s moment: He has been in the House for just six years, but many liberals see his energy and freshness as inspiring.\n\n[How early do presidential campaigns start?

One former senior Afghan security official bluntly accused the strike forces of war crimes.\n\nOften, the raids that resulted in civilian deaths were carried out not far from police outposts or government offices, leaving those American-supported officials humiliated in the villages they had been trying to establish relationships with.

Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.\n\nDefining an institution\u2019s role\n\nFounded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering was the first hospital in the country devoted exclusively to treating cancer. Its benefactors have included some of the wealthiest families in America, from the Astors and Rockefellers in its early years to the Kochs today.\n\nIt now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.\n\nAs a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.\n\nBut some on the hospital\u2019s board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center\u2019s chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were \u201clying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Treatment Gap: In Rehab, \u2018Two Warring Factions\u2019: Abstinence vs. Medication", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit \u2014 an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry\u2019s role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Personal Health: Hearing Loss Threatens Mind, Life and Limb", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/well/live/hearing-loss-threatens-mind-life-and-limb.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "About 85 percent of those with hearing loss are untreated, Dr. Lin said. For older adults alone, this increased health care costs by 46 percent over a period of 10 years, compared with costs incurred by those without hearing loss, the authors reported in November in JAMA Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nOne of the authors, Jennifer A. Deal, an epidemiologist and gerontologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while \u201chearing loss itself is not very expensive, the effect of hearing loss on everything else is expensive.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, people tend to wait much too long to get their hearing tested and treated with hearing aids, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to treat hearing loss, Dr. Lin told me.\n\nAge-related hearing loss comes on really slowly, making it harder for people to know when to take it seriously, he said. He cited two good clues to when to get your hearing tested: Family members or close friends say you should, or you notice that you often mishear or don\u2019t know what others are saying.\n\nBut even when people are tested and spend thousands of dollars to purchase needed hearing aids, the devices often sit in a drawer. People may complain that the sound quality is poor, too static-y or otherwise annoying, and that the aids merely amplify all sound, making it still hard to hear in a noisy environment. All aids are not created equal, Dr. Lin said, and even expensive, properly fitted aids can require multiple adjustments. Some people give up too readily to get the best results.\n\n\u201cUnrealistic expectations are a big part of this problem,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting on a pair of glasses that immediately enables you to see clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing loss is not fixed as easily as eyesight. The brain needs time \u2014 a good month or two \u2014 to adjust to hearing aids. And the earlier hearing loss is treated, the easier it is for the brain to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe new studies give ample cause for taking hearing loss seriously. Consider, for example, the link to dementia. People who can\u2019t hear well often become socially isolated and deprived of stimuli that keep the brain cognitively engaged. As input lessens, so does brain function."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The New Health Care: Congratulations on the Promotion.

Perhaps the main reason I\u2019ve been promoted to that rank is that I\u2019ve been productive in obtaining large federal grants. Successfully completing each project, then getting that research published in high-profile journals, is what allows me to continue to get more funding.\n\nA National Institutes of Health regulation sets a \u201csignificant financial interest\u201d as any amount over $5,000. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that being given thousands of dollars could influence your thinking about research or medicine. But let\u2019s put things in perspective. Many scientists have been awarded millions of dollars in grant funding. This is incredibly valuable not only to them but also to their employers. Journals and gran t funders like to see eye-catching work. It would be silly not to think that this might also subtly influence thinking and actions. In my own work, I do my best to remain conscious of these subtle forces and how they may operate, but it\u2019s a continuing battle.\n\nGetting positive results, or successfully completing projects, can sometimes feel like the only way to achieve success in research careers. Just as those drivers can lead people to publish those results, it can also nudge them not to publish null ones.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I\u2019ve been acutely aware of concerns that relationships between formula companies and the American Academy of Pediatrics might be influencing policies on feeding infants. But biases can occur even without direct financial contributions.\n\nIf an organization has spent decades recommending low-fat diets, it can be hard for that group to acknowledge the potential benefits of a low-carb diet (and vice versa). If a group has been pushing for very low-sodium diets for years, it can be hard for it to acknowledge that this might have been a waste of time, or even worse, bad advice."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: Marburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/health/marburg-virus-fruit-bats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-01 09:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "The Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, has been isolated in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the first time it has been found in West Africa.\n\nFive bats caught in three health districts tested positive for the virus, according to two teams of scientists.
