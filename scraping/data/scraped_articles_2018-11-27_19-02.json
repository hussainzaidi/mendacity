Moreno said the proposal was rejected.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, The Guardian reported that Manafort secretly met several times with Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, including around the time he was made a top figure in the Trump campaign. The Guardian, citing sources, said Manafort met with Assange in 2013, 2015 and in the spring of 2016.\n\nBoth WikiLeaks and Manafort feature prominently in Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. In a court filing on Monday, Mueller accused Manafort of lying to investigators after agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel's office.\n\nThe newspaper said it is unclear \"why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\"\n\nCiting a \"well-placed source,\" The Guardian reported that Manafort met with Assange around March 2016, just months before WikiLeaks released Democratic emails believed to be stolen by Russian intelligence officers.\n\nManafort, the newspaper reported, denied having any involvement in the hack and his lawyers declined to answer the Guardian's questions about the visits. Jennifer Robinson, Assange's UK-based counsel, told CNN \"no such meetings took place.\"\n\n\"We have had no contact with the Mueller investigation,\" she added.\n\nWikiLeaks denied the report shortly after it was published.\n\n\"Remember this day when the Guardian permitted a serial fabricator to totally destroy the paper's reputation. \u2066\u202a@wikileaks\u2069 is willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.\"\n\nRemember this day when the Guardian permitted a serial fabricator to totally destroy the paper's reputation. @WikiLeaks is willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange. https://t.co/R2Qn6rLQjn \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 27, 2018\n\nBarry J.

The list, according to the newspaper, also mentions \"Russians.\"\n\nFor more than a year now, Manafort has been at the heart of several unresolved threads of the Mueller investigation.

And it signals that Mueller's team may be prepared to reveal the depths of what they have learned.\n\nManafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters,\" violating his plea agreement, prosecutors allege in the three-page filing signed by both the defense team and the prosecution. The special counsel's office says it will provide more details at a later date.\n\nBoth sides ask the judge to now move Manafort's case toward sentencing.\n\nThe filing says Manafort does not agree with prosecutors' assertion that he has lied.\n\n\"He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government's characterization or that he has breached the agreement,\" it says.\n\nIt's rare for criminal defendants' cases to near their end in this manner. Large-scale criminal conspiracy investigations are often built around prosecutors' ability to turn criminals into cooperators, who guide them to other, more significant targets or testify against their former colleagues in court.\n\nIt's not immediately clear what impact the development has on Mueller's work or on other possible criminal cases. But the announcement raised the possibility that President Donald Trump could again see Manafort as an ally and antagonist of Mueller, and consider pardoning him.\n\nManafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy and witness tampering on September 14, almost a year after he was first charged and following his conviction by a jury in a separate but related case on eight tax and banking crimes.\n\nManafort, though he has not made public statements since his plea, was thought to be the star cooperator in the special counsel's ongoing probe. In September and October, he met with Mueller's team at least nine times, amounting to hours of discussions.\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Manafort admitted to committing a host of money laundering and foreign lobbying crimes and fraud, giving the federal prosecutors leverage over him. The cases that Mueller's team brought against Manafort largely focused on his Ukrainian political consulting work, his US lobbying over the last decade and the financial management of his business proceeds. Except for one aspect of their bank fraud case, in which Manafort appeared to dangle access to the Trump campaign in exchange for a bank loan, the cases did not publicly describe Manafort's work as campaign chairman.\n\nFor more than a year now, Manafort has been at the heart of several unresolved threads of the Mueller investigation. He had been in the room for the Trump Tower meeting with Russians who touted they had incriminating information about Hillary Clinton; he had allegedly offered private briefings on the campaign to a Russian oligarch to whom he was indebted, according to The Washington Post ; and he had overseen the Trump campaign in the months when Russian military intelligence allegedly hacked Democratic Party officials.\n\nOne of Manafort's closest business contacts for several years has been Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russia-based political operative who prosecutors have alleged has ties to the same Russian military intelligence service that allegedly hacked the Democrats.\n\nManafort has been held in a Virginia jail since June, after he and Kilimnik were accused of attempting to tamper with possible witnesses before his trial. Kilimnik, though also charged by Mueller, has not surfaced in the US court system.\n\nWhen he was last seen in public, in a Virginia federal courtroom about a month ago, Manafort was in a wheelchair and suffering from a health issue similar to gout. He'll be sentenced in February in his criminal case in Virginia, which he took to trial and lost. It's not clear how Monday's development might affect his situation there.\n\nEven though Mueller's team alleges he's breached his plea agreement, Manafort must comply with the prosecutors' demands going forward. With a circumstance like this, only one side of the deal gets torn up -- and that's the prosecutors' promises of mercy, they said in the filing Monday.\n\nThe judge in DC District Court who received the update Monday night has not yet weighed in, and a sentencing for Manafort's guilty plea has not yet been scheduled."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Who is Paul Manafort?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/c5KZXYMk1ok/who-is-paul-manafort-lc-orig.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Kramer has them because his company sued Facebook and accused the social media giant of having a disregard for user privacy. Six4Three also claimed that Zuckerberg devised a plan that forced some of Facebook's rivals, or potential rivals, out of business.\n\nFacebook had fought for months to keep the documents from being made public. It's now possible that their contents could be revealed during the committee's hearing this week.\n\nIn Monday's court filing, Kramer's lawyers claimed that during a recent trip to London, he resisted demands from UK lawmaker Damian Collins that he give Collins the documents. But Kramer eventually \"panicked\" after a UK official showed up at his hotel room and ordered him to surrender the documents, the filing says.\n\nFacebook and Six4Three declined to comment. Collins, who heads the committee investigating Facebook, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHow the documents ended up in the United Kingdom\n\nKramer's story begins with Carole Cadwalladr, a reporter for The Guardian who has covered Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. His attorneys suggested in Monday's court filing that she somehow tipped off members of the UK parliament to Kramer's movements so they would know when he was in the country.\n\nAccording to the court filing, Cadwalladr told Kramer in August \"that she would like to raise Six4Three's case with Damian Collins.\" A few months later, Collins told Kramer that Cadwalladr told him about the Facebook-related documents in Kramer's possession.\n\nAt the time, Kramer told Collins that he couldn't hand over the documents because they were under seal in California, the filing says.\n\nThings escalated earlier this month. Kramer told Cadwalladr that he was taking a business trip to London. According to Monday's filing, the reporter suggested that they meet to talk about the case. Kramer agreed and gave her the address of his hotel.\n\nOnce he arrived, Kramer received an email from Collins and his committee that demanded he produce the documents. The court filing says he declined, citing the California order sealing them.\n\nThat back-and-forth culminated in a visit to Kramer's hotel last Wednesday by the Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, according to the court filing. Kramer's attorneys claim the Serjeant-at-Arms served him with an order demanding that he produce the documents.\n\nThe attorneys say their client \"does not know how\" the committee discovered where he was staying and that the only person he told about the location of his hotel was Cadwalladr.\n\nMonday's court filing does not provide any evidence that Collins learned any information about Kramer's visit from Cadwalladr.\n\nCadwalladr declined to comment for this article.\n\nAfter the hotel visit, Kramer received another email from the committee which threatened to hold him in contempt of Parliament, according to the court filing. Fearing that he'd be barred from leaving the country, he eventually went to Parliament to meet with Collins without telling his lawyers.\n\nThe filing claims that Collins and his staff kept Kramer \"for two hours\" and told him \"that he was under an active investigation, that he was now in contempt of Parliament, and that the penalty could include fines and potential imprisonment.\"\n\n\"At this point, Mr. Kramer panicked,\" the filing says. Kramer downloaded the documents to a USB drive and handed them over to the committee.\n\nThe court filing notes that neither Kramer's company nor its lawyers \"condones or approves of the manner in which Mr. Kramer resolved that dilemma.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nCollins said the committee is reviewing the documents \u2014 which he has called \"clearly of significant interest to the committee's inquiry\" \u2014 so it can decide how to proceed.\n\nThe committee is holding an unprecedented meeting Tuesday during which it will question witnesses on so-called \"fake news\" and disinformation. The meeting will feature representatives from nine countries and will take place in London. An executive from Facebook is scheduled to attend\n\nThe documents could be made public during the hearing. Members of the UK Parliament have \"parliamentary privilege,\" which gives them a great deal of leeway to discuss issues without legal ramifications.\n\nFacebook is also expected to file a brief about the consequences of Collins' having demanded the documents from Kramer, despite the US court order prohibiting their release, including what issues it may raise under the US Constitution.\n\nEarlier this year, CNN filed jointly with The Guardian a motion in the California court asking for the documents to be unsealed. That motion was not successful.

Officials there also refused to comment.\n\n'Threw a fit'\n\nThe reason for the delay continues to be a White House worry about angering Saudi Arabia, which strongly opposes the resolution, multiple sources say. CNN reported earlier this month that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, \"threw a fit\" when presented with an early draft of the document, leading to a delay and further discussions among Western allies on the matter.\n\nSources say US concerns, which are shared by other nations -- including the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, both of which support Saudi in the conflict -- hinge on the real possibility that if the Security Council resolution is voted through, Saudi Arabia or the Houthis, or both, won't show up for hoped-for talks that are expected to take place next month in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThis latest delay comes a week after President Donald Trump indicated that he will not take strong action against Saudi Arabia or the crown prince for the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will brief lawmakers about the Khashoggi killing on Wednesday.\n\nThe move to slow the resolution could increase tensions with lawmakers from both parties who have expressed deep reservations about US support for the kingdom's war in Yemen and would like to censure Saudi Arabia for what its officials admit was a premeditated murder.\n\nAnd it will continue to fuel questions about Trump's unusual deference to the kingdom.\n\nJUST WATCHED Houthis ready for Yemen ceasefire, leader says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Houthis ready for Yemen ceasefire, leader says 03:04\n\nThe draft resolution, crafted by the UK and obtained by CNN, is already seen by human rights groups as disappointingly watered-down: It calls for a ceasefire only in Hodeidah, the principal Red Sea port through which some 80% of humanitarian aid flows.\n\nThe resolution is not at all critical of Saudi Arabia, and in fact compliments Saudi action; it is critical only of the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran and have been fighting Saudi-led coalition forces while maintaining control of the capital, Sanaa.\n\nMattis said last Wednesday that peace talks would take place in Sweden, even as experts cautioned that there's no guarantee Saudi Arabia will take the steps needed for that to happen.\n\nAlthough the resolution in its current form is far from harsh on the Saudis, sources with knowledge of the discussions tell CNN that Saudi Arabia views even calling for a ceasefire and urging more humanitarian aid as indirect criticism of the kingdom and its four-year-long intervention in Yemen.\n\n'Hugely sensitive'\n\n\"The Saudis are hugely sensitive -- ultra, ultra sensitive -- to international perceptions,\" one source told CNN. \"They hate criticism. And (the crown prince) brings a whole new level of paranoia about this.\"\n\nThe situation in Yemen is now viewed as the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet, with some 13 million Yemenis at risk of starving to death, according to the United Nations and human rights groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, five human rights groups had issued an unusually stark statement, saying the US will bear shared responsibility for what may be the largest famine in decades if it doesn't cease support for the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nSave the Children said Wednesday that an estimated 85,000 children under the age of 5 may have died from extreme hunger or disease since the war began.\n\nBut one source says that any language on human rights or accountability should not be expected in the UN resolution, as that would be \"unwelcome to the coalition\" fighting the Houthis.\n\nThe source told CNN that the crafters of the draft resolution know it is unbalanced in its criticism solely of the Houthis, but \"we are faced with a very stubborn set of allies. When you see this resolution not being critical of Saudis, some of that is because if they feel the entire world is against them, they'll continue this war.\"\n\nThe conflict, which began in 2015 as a civil war after the ouster of a strongman leader, gathered force when Saudi Arabia and allies entered the battle to counter what they saw as Iranian influence. The Gulf coalition received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France, which have also been selling weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter nearly four years, the war has killed around 57,000 people, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a crisis mapping project."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Ukraine approves martial law as Russia tensions escalate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/sSCJsgnD_1k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Moscow (CNN) Ukrainian lawmakers on Monday voted to introduce martial law in the border areas with Russia after it seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in a key waterway that holds strategic importance for both countries.\n\nIt's the first time Ukraine has enacted martial law since the conflict with Russia began in 2014, indicating a major escalation in tensions between the two former Soviet Republics.\n\nThe law -- which could give the government extraordinary powers over civil society -- will start on November 28 and will last 30 days.

It added that the tugboat and one of the gunboats were disabled and towed away by the Russian navy. The other gunboat was undamaged but was also seized by Russia, Ukraine said.\n\nOn Monday, Russia's state news agency RIA reported that all 24 sailors aboard the three boats were detained by Russia, citing sources in Crimea's security agencies. Three of the sailors were now in a hospital, it added.\n\nThe Kerch Strait -- a shallow, narrow stretch of water just 2 to 3 miles wide at one point -- connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea.\n\nIt's also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, a peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait was opened in May.\n\nRussia has 'no justification' says NATO\n\nAhead of an extraordinary meeting of NATO-Ukraine ambassadors in Brussels late Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia had \"no justification\" for seizing the Ukrainian ships.\n\n\"What we saw yesterday was very serious because we actually saw Russia use military force against Ukraine in an open and direct way,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that NATO has increased its presence in the black sea region. \"We have to show Russia that its actions have consequences.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Stoltenberg pledged the alliance's \"full support for Ukraine's territorial integrity\" following a morning phone call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nSimilarly, European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic condemned Russia at a press briefing on Monday. She called on Russia to \"immediately release the vessels and the crew.\"\n\nEuropean member states of the UN Security Council -- including France, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the UK -- also called on Russia to restore freedom of passage at the Kerch Strait, in a statement.\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the incident as a \"dangerous provocation\" by Kiev that required \"special attention and special investigation,\" the state news agency TASS reported.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been locked in long-simmering conflict since the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and a war with Russian-backed separatists in the country's east has claimed more than 10,000 lives.\n\nProtesters gather outside the Russian embassy in Kiev on Sunday evening.\n\nWhat happened\n\nUkraine and Russia offered conflicting accounts of the incident, each accusing the other of violating the laws of the sea. A 2003 agreement confirms the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait as domestic waters of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service (FSB) Border Service in Crimea reported that three Ukrainian warships had illegally entered Russia's territorial waters and were carrying out dangerous maneuvers, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nTASS reported the three Ukrainian vessels were detained by Russian forces and that \"weapons were used to force them to stop.\"\n\n\"They did not respond to legitimate demands by the ships and boats of Russia's FSB Border Guard Service escorting them to stop immediately and performed dangerous maneuvers,\" the FSB said, according to TASS.\n\nThree Ukrainian servicemen were wounded and received medical care from the Russians, TASS said.\n\nThe Ukrainian navy, on the other hand, said Russian border patrol vessels \"carried out openly aggressive action\" against the Ukrainian ships.\n\nPresident Poroshenko's office described the Russian action against the Ukrainian navy ships as \"an act of aggression aimed at deliberately escalating the situation in the waters of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait,\" and called for international condemnation of Moscow and the imposition of new sanctions.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov also tweeted video he claims shows the two ships colliding.\n\nThe video appears to be shot from on board a Russian vessel. A commander can be heard speaking Russian, swearing and ordering his crew to \"slam him from the right,\" \"squeeze him\" and finally warning those on board to \"hold on\" before the moment of impact.\n\nIt's unclear how Avakov obtained the video. Similar clips were released by Russian state media but those did not show the actual collision.\n\n\u041c\u0412\u0421 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0437\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 -\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f \"\u0414\u043e\u043d\" \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0430. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0437\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438, \u0447\u0443\u0442\u043d\u0456 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438 - \u0446\u0435 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u043c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434!\n\n\u0410\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0456\u044f! \u0413\u0443\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0456\u043a\u0443\u0454\u043c\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0456\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d! pic.twitter.com/f0e9hFB1BT \u2014 Arsen Avakov (@AvakovArsen) November 25, 2018\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the incident had been devised to \"divert attention from the internal problems that are ravaging Ukraine and blame the neighbor responsible for all of Ukraine's troubles.\"\n\nIn the wake of the incident, Russia temporarily closed off the strait.

What happened next would rock his family.\n\nSmith, 41, was shot multiple times by an alleged burglar running from officers, police said. He spent the next eight days in a hospital, his wife said, dying on Thanksgiving day.\n\nThe incident began November 14 in Barstow, a city 115 miles northeast of Los Angeles, when police received a call about a burglary, according to a news release from the Barstow Police Department. The caller said their neighbor's home was being broken into and that flashlights could be seen inside the neighbor's home. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Smith said, a different neighbor called their house because she heard noises outside.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they chased two teenage boys on foot to the back of the burglarized home and lost sight of them. As officers were searching for the boys, they heard multiple gunshots from the side of a nearby home, police said. That's where officers found Smith suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nSmith, police said, was shot after walking to the side of the home and being confronted by one of the boys. CNN affiliate KTLA reports that Smith was shot eight times.\n\nSmith was flown to a local hospital, police said. Officers found a loaded handgun near the scene of the shooting, police said. Evidence technicians confirmed the handgun found by the officers matched the caliber of the shell casings found at the scene of the shooting, police said.\n\nFour teenage boys, ages 15 to 17, were arrested at the scene. Police have identified the suspected shooter as Leslie Hawkins, 18. Detectives searched the scene for Hawkins but were unable to locate him. KTLA reports that Hawkins is still at large.\n\n'No one saw it coming'\n\nSmith lived eight days after his injuries, Elizabeth Smith said.\n\n\"He went in with eight gunshot wounds, a broken thumb/wrist, fractured jaw, split tongue, missing teeth, two collapsed lungs, and almost completely devoid of blood,\" she told KTLA . Elizabeth Smith said her husband underwent multiple surgeries.\n\nShe told CNN on Sunday she wasn't able to ride with her husband to the hospital, so she feared she wouldn't get a chance to say goodbye.\n\n\"To be given a week to stay with him is priceless,\" she said.\n\nSmith spent the entire eight days alternating among the the operating room, intensive care unit and the surgical ward.\n\n\"He was in really good spirits,\" Elizabeth Smith said.\n\nOne of the most memorable days, she said, was November 18. The couple are huge Pittsburgh Steelers fans, she said. So when the Steelers were playing the Jacksonville Jaguars that Sunday, she knew she had to find a way to download a game and invite family over.\n\nElizabeth Smith streamed the Pittsburgh Steelers-Jacksonville Jaguars game for her husband, Patrick Smith, while he was in the hospital.\n\n\"We were able to have a Steelers game party,\" she said.\n\nThe group ended up watching the game on Elizabeth's laptop in Smith's hospital room, she said.\n\n\"He told me days later that it was one of the greatest things,\" she said. \"He was really looking forward to watching the Steelers-Broncos game\" on Sunday.\n\nBut things took an unexpected turn. The night before Thanksgiving, Elizabeth Smith said, she and her husband stayed up late watching the finale of \"American Horror Story\" and discussing their differing theories on the show.\n\n\"That's what we did, we were nerds together,\" she said. The couple had been together 10 years and married for seven.\n\nOn Thanksgiving day, Smith was rushed to the intensive care unit after he began vomiting, Elizabeth Smith said. After multiple rounds of CPR, he died in the ICU, she said. His cause of death is still unknown.\n\n\"It was an absolute shock what happened that afternoon, no one saw it coming,\" Elizabeth Smith said.\n\nDespite his passing, Smith's mother-in-law Deanna Dibble said she feels the family was given extra time.\n\n\"We were given one more week with him to say goodbye,\" she said through tears.\n\nSmith, a California native, worked as a facilities maintenance manager in Barstow. His wife and mother-in-law described the 6-foot-5-inch, 350-pound man as a gentle giant who smiled a lot.\n\n\"We relied on Patrick to be our savior, he was the person who protected us. He was just so big,\" Dibble said.\n\nHe leaves behind not only his wife, but the couple's 5-year-old son, Dyllinger.\n\n\"He knows his dad is in heaven and is an angel now,\" Elizabeth Smith said.\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up originally to help Smith get \"back on his feet.\" As of Monday afternoon, the page had raised over $42,000."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Dozens of migrants arrested for illegally crossing US-Mexico border", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/zGSZShLKYk0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) They've spent weeks trekking across Mexico, trying to reach the United States.

The rough tally includes 3,598 men, 1,041 women and 993 children, SEDESOL Director Mario Figueroa said.\n\nA peaceful march was planned for Sunday, starting at the sports complex and continuing to the border. In response, CBP deployed additional personnel to San Ysidro in expectation of demonstrations on both sides of the border.\n\nAs migrants reached the border area, some protesters split off toward multiple locations, CBP said. Some attempted to enter through San Ysidro and were turned away, the agency said. Others tried to enter \"directly east and west of the border crossing.\"\n\nAfter they were prevented from entering the port of entry, some of the migrants \"attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.\n\n\"DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons. We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our front-line operators, or violates our nation's sovereignty,\" Nielsen said.\n\nPhotos: Unrest at the US-Mexico border A member of Mexico's Federal Police tries to grab migrants as they attempt to cross the border into the United States on Sunday, November 25.

It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study's authors also note that universal screening recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to Frazier.\n\n\"Having prevalence estimates -- even if there is some variation -- helps us to advocate for improved screening, diagnosis, interventions and supports,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: Why Cindy Hyde-Smith is a near-lock to win in Mississippi today", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/budC4xuHtUU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The 2018 election officially ends today as Mississippi voters head to the polls to choose between Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) and former Rep. Mike Espy (D). Hyde-Smith is considered the favorite in the runoff due to the clear Republican lean of the Magnolia State but her campaign has drawn a series of negative headlines over the past few weeks , headlines that have injected race into the, well, race.\n\nTo get a sense of the lay of the land of the last Senate election of 2018, I reached out to Sam R. Hall , who is the executive editor of the Clarion Ledger, the largest paper in Mississippi.\n\nOur conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n\nCillizza: It's Election Day in Mississippi. Which side feels better -- and why?\n\nHall: Hyde-Smith. She's had a rough three weeks -- largely self-inflicted -- but I think most of it turns out to be political flesh wounds.\n\nMississippi is still heavily and reliably Republican. Gov. Phil Bryant and President Donald Trump are immensely popular; the rallies Monday will be a huge boost for her. And Hyde-Smith's campaign has been relentless with political attack ads against Espy for three solid weeks\n\nEspy has garnered a lot more attention because of Hyde-Smith's screw-ups, but I don't think it is anywhere near enough for him to win. If he gets within 10 points, then that would be a monumental voting shift and point toward Hyde-Smith possibly having a serious primary challenger in 2020.\n\nCillizza: Cindy Hyde-Smith has drawn LOTS of negative national headlines over the past month. What's the reaction been like in Mississippi?\n\nHall: Almost universally partisan. While there have been a number of Republicans who privately admit she's made major missteps, few think it's going to cost her the race.\n\nThe most diverse opinions seem to center around the hanging comment . There are diehard supporters who believe it was nothing more than a turn of phrase, that she meant nothing by it and that Democrats and the \"liberal media\" are just making much out of nothing. Other supporters -- and most GOP politicos with whom I've spoken -- tend to agree with much of that sentiment but also acknowledge that a) it was a stupid thing to say and b) that the response was grossly mishandled , which led to the firestorm that has engulfed her.\n\nWhoever told her she should steadfastly refuse to apologize and stubbornly point back to her initial statement should never be allowed near another campaign. The only thing that would have been worse for her campaign would have been to say, \"Yeah, I said it, and I meant it.\" By letting it continue on, it gave more and more credence to every misstep or questionable issue from her past -- especially to the national media.\n\nDemocrats and Espy supporters seemed more shocked at the way she handled it than what she actually said. They couldn't believe that she allowed it to get so far away from her. As more questionable pieces came out, they continued to follow a narrative of an old school, Deep South Republican politician with racist world views running against a moderate African-American Democrat with a history of crossing party lines. It was a godsend for them and the kind of narrative they were honestly expecting had [former state senator] Chris McDaniel made the runoff, not Hyde-Smith.\n\nBut, overall, this is Mississippi. Everyone here -- Republican, Democrat and other -- are desensitized to a degree about racial issues from someone's past. We still have the Confederate emblem on our state flag, despite the business community and a growing number of politicians from both parties saying it should be changed (including Sen. Roger Wicker.) It's going to take more than an off-the-cuff comment and a photo at a museum to move large swaths of the electorate.\n\nI'd be remiss not to point out that Hyde-Smith doesn't have a history of racial divisiveness in her political life. There are a lot of people -- Republicans and Democrats -- who believe she may not have been ready for the national spotlight that came with this campaign, but they don't believe she is a bigoted racist, especially considering some of the elected officials and politicians who consistently say and embrace far worse things.\n\nCillizza: Trump was initially skeptical of Hyde-Smith as an appointed senator. He's now all in for her -- including two rallies in the state on Monday. What changed?\n\nHall: Gov. Phil Bryant. He and the President have forged an interesting relationship. The governor was the only one who was going to persuade the President and his staff that Hyde-Smith was the candidate they needed. McDaniel is clearly more in line with the President's brand, but he sealed his fate in 2014 when he continued to challenge his defeat to Sen. Thad Cochran and refused to ever concede that race. There was real political animosity between McDaniel and state GOP leaders, including Bryant.\n\nToo, the Alabama [Senate] race scared a lot of people, and Republicans here feared a repeat of that race if McDaniel was in a runoff against a credible Democrat like Espy. That was likely a big selling point.\n\nFinally, it didn't hurt that Hyde-Smith was with Trump from the beginning. Had she not been, who knows what would have happened.\n\nCillizza: Espy avoided highlighting some of Hyde-Smith's potential negatives -- the public hanging comment, segregated schools etc. -- during their debate. What explains his strategy?\n\nHall: He did highlight the public hanging comment. His most memorable line (and, honestly, there weren't many) was when he went after her for a very late apology she read from notes: \"I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\"\n\nBut past that, I don't think he felt like carrying the water on that attack was in his best interest, and he was probably correct. He didn't go after her as hard on racial issues as some of his supporters would have liked, but that was an extremely tricky line for him to walk. To win this race, he has to have sizable white support. If he had gone with a full-throated offensive on race-related issues, he potentially could have lost moderate whites who thought her comment was dumb and her response petty but still weren't convinced that she meant anything racist by it. He probably didn't want to be painted as a black candidate playing the race card, especially while running on a message of working with everyone regardless of race or partisan leanings. (And to his credit, he has a history of doing those things.)\n\nAs for the segregated schools issue , that had not come up yet -- or at least wasn't widespread. I suspect he would have approached it much the same way for the same reasons. Too, this issue is not clear-cut, either. Yes, there are a lot of private schools that were started as segregation academies, and some of them still exist today. However, you'd be hard-pressed to say that they all still exist solely -- and in some (many?) cases -- for the same reason. Then there is the fact that Espy sent his children to a private school, too. Granted, his children went to an Episcopalian private school that did not have the same racial history, but try explaining that to voters in a 15-second soundbite in a debate or making voters care that there is a difference.\n\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Cindy Hyde-Smith wins by a comfortable margin, the lesson is _____________.\" Now explain.\n\nHall: \"Unclear and complicated.\"\n\nThe easy -- and lazy -- assumption would be that nothing has changed, that Mississippi still embraces a racist heritage. Yes, there is still a sizable portion of our electorate who do just that, but I sincerely believe they are the minority. They may still be large enough to swing some elections, but they are in the minority and continue to dwindle. (Look at the number of people who continue to come out in favor of changing the state flag to see that it's changing. Look at those running for higher office who refuse to advocate for a new flag despite their largest financial backers doing so as evidence that the racist element of our electorate is still sizable enough to matter -- at least in GOP primaries.)\n\nMore importantly, however, is the fact that a number of people in Mississippi -- on both ends of the political spectrum -- believe the national political parties and national media got carried away. Saying you would be on the front row of a public hanging may be disturbing -- it is certainly not very smart for someone running for office, especially in Mississippi -- but it isn't automatically racist. Not admitting to how such a comment could be interpreted as having racial undertones and initially refusing to just apologize for anyone hurt by it and then move on was far dumber than saying it in the first place. But the political storm it set off drew clear lines in the sand that have held ever since.\n\nAt the end of the day, this race was essentially decided on November 6 when Hyde-Smith drummed McDaniel and ended up matching Espy's vote total. That should have been his ceiling -- 41% -- and the next three weeks should have been pretty mundane. Now he may surpass 41%, but to believe he is going to shoot up 10 percentage points is naive.\n\nI said right after the debate Tuesday that I felt like the runoff results would be essentially what everyone expected after the runoff was set: essentially a 60-40 win for Hyde-Smith, give or take a couple of points. I also said I would be more shocked by a 10-point race than a 30-point or higher race. While I now would be more surprised by Hyde-Smith hitting 65%, I still don't think this race is that close. Espy getting to 45% would be a strong showing, though it would likely point more toward Hyde-Smith's weakness as a candidate than his strength.\n\nAll in all, don't be surprised to see a 60-40 race. For all the national attention, I don't think the needle has moved much here. This is a solidly Republican state, and for all her missteps and the very poor way she's handled the controversies, Hyde-Smith hasn't done anything that I see would cost her the race. And quite honestly, Espy hasn't really done anything that would convince a lot of people to switch to him. He's run a credible race, but just running a credible race isn't good enough for a Democrat in Mississippi. He's not done enough to motivate voters. You hear plenty of talk about voting against Hyde-Smith for various reasons, but you hear very little about voters inspired to go vote for Espy."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mississippi's US Senate race comes to a close amid racial controversies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/o-K5bUMw9K0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith was expected to coast to victory in a Mississippi runoff that would conclude the last Senate race of 2018's midterm elections.\n\nInstead, Hyde-Smith has spent the days leading up to Tuesday's election mired in controversy that evoked the state's dark history of racism and slavery.\n\nIt began when video emerged online of her telling supporters earlier this month that she'd be \"on the front row\" if one of her supporters there \"invited me to a public hanging.\" She later called the comments an \"exaggerated expression of regard,\" but her use of the phrase \"public hanging\" brought memories of Mississippi's history of lynchings to the forefront and put the contest under the national microscope.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mississippi voters will decide between Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, who, if elected, would be the state's first black senator since Reconstruction. President Donald Trump, anxious to finish out the 2018 campaign season with a Republican victory, urged voters to turn out for Hyde-Smith in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nThe result will finalize the balance of power in the US Senate. As it stands, Republicans will hold 52 seats next year, and Democrats will have 47. A win for the GOP in Mississippi would further pad the party's majority in the Senate, even as Democrats have taken a solid majority in the House.\n\nThe state is polarized along racial lines, with most white voters backing Republicans and nearly all black voters supporting Democrats.\n\nDemocrats hope Hyde-Smith's comments will lead to a surge in black turnout and propel them to victory. However, even if black voters, who make up nearly 40% of the state's electorate, come out in full force, Espy would still have to outperform his party's history with whites to have a chance of winning.\n\nAnd Democrats have to overcome partisan trends in the deeply red state. Earlier this month, when multiple candidates in both parties were on the ballot, Hyde-Smith and conservative Chris McDaniel combined for 58% of the vote, while Espy and Democrat Tobey Bartee got 42%.\n\nOn the eve of the election, Trump held two rallies for Hyde-Smith in an attempt to turn out the Republican base.\n\nHe told the crowd in Tupelo to \"get out\" and vote in Tuesday's runoff.\n\n\"I think it'll be a very big day for Cindy, but don't take any chances,\" he said. \"That's happened many times before. That never works out well. Just assume you have to vote.\"\n\nEven though Republicans will control the Senate regardless of the outcome, the President suggested that a Democratic win in Mississippi would \"revoke\" the party's victories.\n\n\"We cannot allow Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to revoke that victory by winning the state of Mississippi,\" he said.\n\nAt a roundtable in Gulfport, Trump called Hyde-Smith's comments about a public hanging \"sad and a little flip.\"\n\n\"When I spoke to her -- she called me -- she said, 'I said something that I meant exactly very different,' and I heard an apology loud and clear,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I know where her heart is, and her heart is good. That's not what she was meaning when she said that,\" he said.\n\nHyde-Smith at center of controversy\n\nThough public polling has been limited, the race is seen as potentially competitive because of Hyde-Smith's \"public hanging\" remarks.\n\nThose comments prompted deeper dives into her history.\n\nThe same progressive blogger who published the video of her using the phrase \"public hanging\" later published one in which Hyde-Smith told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \"a great thing.\" Her campaign said it was a joke, but that explanation backfired when the black student from the event seen laughing in a picture her campaign posted on Twitter responded that Hyde-Smith's campaign was using him as a prop.\n\nOn Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith had attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate public schools. Hyde-Smith's daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press. The senator's campaign responded to the report by attacking the \"liberal media.\"\n\nOver the weekend, CNN reported that Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier's effort to \"defend his homeland\" and had pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War.\n\nIn photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The caption on the post read, \"Mississippi history at its best!\"\n\nEspy's campaign hammered Hyde-Smith with television ads that cast her as an embarrassment to a state that has attempted to overcome its history of slavery and racism.\n\n\"We've worked hard to overcome the stereotypes that hurt our economy and cost us jobs. Her words should not reflect Mississippi's values, either,\" a narrator said in one ad. The ad also called Hyde-Smith \"so embarrassing, she'd be a disaster for Mississippi.\"\n\nSeveral companies that had donated to Hyde-Smith's campaign, including Walmart, publicly withdrew their support for the senator over the \"public hanging\" comment.\n\nIn her debate with Espy, Hyde-Smith said she would \"certainly apologize\" to anyone who was offended by her remark. But she quickly pivoted into attack mode.\n\n\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" she said.\n\nGOP fights to avoid embarrassment\n\nThe controversies surrounding Hyde-Smith set off a major push by national Republicans to avoid the same embarrassment they'd suffered last year in Alabama and save Hyde-Smith.\n\nWhile Hyde-Smith largely stayed off the campaign trail, the party's infrastructure rallied to her defense. GOP groups spent $4 million on the Mississippi runoff -- much more than Democrats' $1.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Republican groups spent more than twice as much as Democrats on television advertisements, per the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.\n\nTrump's visits to Mississippi on Monday night were also seen as bid to rally the Republican base to vote in an election taking place two days after the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nFor Democrats, the best-case scenario is similar to how Democratic Sen. Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore in Alabama a year ago: a narrow victory fueled by massive turnout from black voters.\n\nBut Mississippi is, in some ways, more challenging than Alabama. Moore faced allegations that, as an adult, he had sought sexual relationships with teenage girls.\n\nAnd the state is more rural than its eastern neighbor.

Currently, the FDA investigation does not implicate lettuce from any of these areas.\n\nWhile the romaine supply undergoes a \"clean break\" to ensure all the contaminated lettuce is effectively gone from the market, the FDA has asked producers and distributors to provide clear labeling with the lettuce's date and origin in the future.\n\nA task force within the lettuce industry has also been established to determine better solutions for labeling long-term in order to help with tracing.\n\n\"Based on discussions with major producers and distributors, romaine lettuce entering the market will now be labeled with a harvest location and a harvest date,\" Gottlieb said. \"Romaine lettuce entering the market can also be labeled as being hydroponically or greenhouse grown. If it does not have this information, you should not eat or use it.\n\n\"If consumers, retailers and food service facilities are unable to identify that romaine lettuce products are not affected -- which means determining that the products were grown outside the California regions that appear to be implicated in the current outbreak investigation -- we urge that these products not be purchased, or if purchased, be discarded or returned to the place of purchase.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC.

In his YouTube video, He describes the procedure as having \"removed the doorway through which HIV enters.\"\n\nHe's claims have neither been independently verified nor peer-reviewed. Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many counties, including the United States. In the UK, editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.\n\nChina has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, with the government bankrolling research into a number of world \"firsts,\" including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.\n\nMore recently researchers in China claimed to have bred healthy mice from same-sex parents, using gene editing technology.\n\nBut in a statement posted Tuesday morning, China's National Health Commission said that it had \"immediately requested the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission to seriously investigate and verify\" the claims made by He Jiankui.\n\nThe statement follows moves by the Chinese hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, to distance itself from involvement in the procedures.\n\n\"We can ensure that the research wasn't conducted in our hospital nor were the babies born here,\" a hospital representative told CNN. The hospital confirmed that two of the doctors named in He's documents work at the hospital and suggested that an internal investigation was underway.\n\nAn initial investigation by the hospital said that signatures on He's ethics review form are suspected to be forged. The hospital has never convened an ethics committee meeting on it, according to a statement on its WeChat account , and the facility will ask police to intervene and investigate it and hold related people accountable by law.\n\nThe Shenzhen Health and Family Planning Commission denounced the legitimacy of the hospital ethics committee and the review process that approved the application. It confirmed that an investigation was launched Monday to \"verify the authenticity of the ethical review of the research reported by media.\"\n\nHe's University, Southern University of Science and Technology, said in a statement that the researcher has been on leave since February 1.\n\n\"The research work was carried out outside the school by Associate Professor He Jiankui. He did not report to the school or the department of biology. The university and the biology department are not aware of it,\" the institution said, adding that \"the Academic Committee of the Department of Biology believes that it seriously violates academic ethics and academic norms.\"\n\nA 'huge blow' to Chinese research\n\nA joint statement issued by more than 120 Chinese scientists on the Chinese social media site Weibo condemns the human genome-editing research.\n\n\"The medical ethics review exists in the name only. Directly experimenting on human is nothing but crazy ... as soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring, as the modified inheritable substance will inevitably blend into human genome pool,\" they wrote, adding that the trial is a \"huge blow\" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research. \"It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientist who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics.\"\n\nJulian Savulescu, director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, described the alleged births as \"genetic Russian Roulette.\"\n\n\"If true, this experiment is monstrous,\" he said. \"The embryos were healthy. No known diseases. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.\n\n\"There are many effective ways to prevent HIV in healthy individuals: For example, protected sex. And there are effective treatments if one does contract it,\" Savulescu said.\n\nJoyce Harper, a professor in genetics and human embryology at the Institute for Women's Health at University College London, described the alleged research \"premature, dangerous and irresponsible,\" calling for public debate and legislation.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Before this procedure comes anywhere near clinical practice, we need years of work to show that meddling with the genome of the embryo is not going to cause harm to the future person,\" she said in a statement.\n\nDespite ethical concerns in the West, a recent study suggested that the Chinese public is broadly in favor of using gene-editing for medical purposes. An online survey conducted by Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou found that more than two-thirds of the 4,771 people surveyed (575 of whom reportedly have HIV), supported its use in treating diseases, according to the state-run tabloid Global Times.\n\n\"(Chinese people) have a high willingness to use of gene in disease prevention and treatment,\" Liang Chen, a professor at Sun Yat-Sen University was quoted as saying. \"This suggests that the research of gene editing in China not only has a promising potential, but also is responding to the public's needs.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Sky-high prices for air ambulances hurt those they are helping", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/D6l9M0h6PaQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sonna Anderson was enjoying a horseback ride through the Badlands in North Dakota in September 2017 when her horse, Cody, got spooked, jerked toward a fence and tripped on a cow track in the dirt. The horse rolled onto Anderson, who hit her head, briefly lost consciousness and broke three ribs.\n\nThe 911 transcript shows that an ambulance reached the 60-year-old judge from Bismarck within 20 minutes. Anderson was secured on a backboard and ready to go when an air ambulance, a helicopter with a medical crew, also landed at the scene. Anderson says her husband asked repeatedly whether the ground ambulance crew could take her by ground; there was a hospital less than an hour's drive away.\n\n\"But he was told that [the air ambulance] was necessary. They never told him why it was necessary or how much it cost, but they insisted I had to go by air ambulance,\" Anderson said. \"But it's so odd there is nothing in the record that indicated it was time-sensitive or that I needed to be airlifted.\"\n\nFor that one helicopter ride, to a hospital farther away in Bismarck, records show that Valley Med Flight charged Anderson $54,727.26. Sanford Health Plan, her insurance, paid $13,697.73. That left Anderson with a $41,029.53 bill.\n\nValley Med Flight did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"It shocked me,\" Anderson said. \"I kept thinking, 'my God.' I got a copy of the 911 and air ambulance report to see how long they actually spent with me, when really, it was only around 45 minutes. I wrote [the air ambulance company] a letter telling them that I thought it was all outrageous.\"\n\nShared outrage\n\nabout air ambulance bills have Anderson is not alone. CNN reached out to every state's insurance regulatory office. Nearly every one said it has heard from patients like Anderson, and complaintsabout air ambulance bills have \"increased rapidly,\" according to the Mississippi commissioner of insurance.\n\nCharges vary wildly. CNN saw bills ranging from nearly $34,000 to more than $533,000.\n\nflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state 2017 federal investigation found that costs for an average air ambulanceflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state investigation found.\n\nEach state's law varies in what can be disclosed about these complaints due to its interpretation of patient privacy. In some cases, CNN could see details about the patient's condition, how far and where they were flown, how much they were charged, how much insurance paid and the nature of the complaint. Some states released much less. Some would acknowledge only that there had been complaints. However, it's clear that these bills can be devastating for families.\n\nOne complaint sent to the Michigan insurance office says a family flew a dying relative home after he got sick in Arizona. To get him to a hospice in Michigan cost $547,725.\n\nIt cost another family $62,749.35 to fly a child with a malignant brain tumor from Wisconsin to Houston to see a specialist.\n\nBut these high prices aren't just for cross-country flights. An air ambulance transferred a man from a hospital in Winter Haven, Florida, to one in Orlando for tests, which would be a one-hour drive. The complaint to the Michigan insurance office about that Florida flight said the family faced a $31,253.33 bill.\n\nJUST WATCHED $4,680 bill for air ambulance hits 17 years later Replay More Videos ...

It cost $37,850, according to a letter to the state insurance department.\n\n\"We carry insurance to avoid the catastrophic situations,\" wrote the man, whose name was redacted. \"I don't see where the consumer is getting a fair shake in this deal.\"\n\nThe desire may be there for change, but nothing's worked.\n\nThe price of these flights is not regulated by Obamacare. Instead, they fall under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act , which removed a state's ability to control airfares and routes long before air ambulances were common. October's Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act created a committee to address the problem, but it failed to design a definitive solution, experts say.\n\nAir ambulances take off\n\nAir ambulances became necessary out of a desperate need to save lives, but some question whether their value remains.\n\nIn 1966, civilian deaths from accidental injuries were \"a public health problem second only to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars,\" the National Academy of Sciences wrote at the time.\n\nAir ambulances weren't a regular civilian option then, but when researchers discovered that soldiers wounded in the Vietnam War had better survival rates than California motorists injured in car accidents, the US government decided to fund two medical helicopter experiments in 1969. They were successful, and hospitals slowly started creating their own programs.\n\nThe golden hour\n\nA 'cash cow'\n\nthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion Demand for services wasn't the industry's only growth driver. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new fee schedule that was much more generous to independent operators and paid more for rural trips. Almost immediately, new companies entered the market. Private equity firms, not hospitals, now ownthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion in 2010 and sold it five years later for $2 billion\n\nAs private companies got into the market, prices went up. Between 2010 and 2014, the median price that air ambulance companies charged Medicare doubled to nearly $30,000 a ride, according to a 2017 US Government Accountability Office investigation\n\n\"They have a cash cow on their hands,\" New Mexico state Rep. Liz Thomson said.\n\nThomson said a state analysis also found a 98% increase in the amount charged by air ambulance providers that weren't covered by insurance between 2009 and 2015. When patients travel on helicopters that are not in-network, insurance will cover little or nothing at all.\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services says more firms are accepting insurance -- about a dozen announced that they were going in-network this year -- but still too many do not, Thomson said, and that can be a serious issue.\n\n\"If they aren't in a network, they don't have to adhere to the usual customary fees that insurance will pay,\" said Susan Rider, an employee benefits and human capital HR consultant with Gregory & Appel Insurance in Indianapolis. \"They don't have to participate, so they don't, and then essentially, they can charge what they want.\"\n\nIn 2017, Thomson introduced a bill to cap reimbursement rates and let consumers off the hook for \"balance bills,\" meaning what consumers owe above what insurance pays. The bill failed in the New Mexico Legislature, but she hopes to introduce it again.\n\nThe air ambulance industry packed the committee hearing room when Thomson introduced the bill, but it was not alone.\n\n\"I'm a Democrat and introduce a lot of legislation around patient protection, so I had a running joke that while I don't drink, I would drink a bottle of champagne if the [insurance?] industry ever stood up for any of my bills,\" Thomson said. \"Sure enough, I needed to buy a bottle, because when the chair asked who was in favor of the bill, all these insurance people stood up and said, 'we are.' This practice is costing them a mint. It's outrageous.\"\n\nMike Castleberry , senior vice president of network services and business development for HealthSCOPE Benefits , a national firm that helps major companies manage health plans, said the costs for these services don't add up. \"When you really get into the math, it starts to get embarrassing for the folks running those businesses,\" he said.\n\n\"We know what their fuel costs. We know how many hours they fly and how much it costs for a pilot,\" Castleberry said. \"Add up all those factors, even if you give them a 20% profit on top of that, that's still not even half what they are charging me, which is more like 300 to 400 times what it actually costs to fly our customers. When I can go rent a private plane and put medical personnel on board for less than some of these bills, I know it shouldn't cost this much.\"\n\nHe also notes that a lot of patients whose bills the firm sees, who are told to take these flights, aren't trauma cases. \"They are not for a wreck on the side of the road needing Level I trauma care,\" Castleberry said. \"Only about 15% of the air ambulance charges we see involve those kind of accidents. The vast majority are patient transfers from one facility to the other.\"\n\nCastleberry, who has clients across the country, said private operators aren't the only ones making money. \"County governments and city hospitals [which can have their own air ambulance services] also see it as a revenue stream that supports their overall programs,\" he said.\n\nThe actual costs\n\nThe air medical transport industry argues that although single flights \"may appear to be expensive,\" they are \"very cost-effective\" compared with building new rural specialty care or expanding ground ambulance capabilities.\n\nStaffing an independent helicopter around the clock is expensive. It costs about $3 million to run an independent air medical base that does roughly 300 transports a year, said Chris Eastlee , vice president of government relations for the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nSome in the industry argue the problem is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services don't pay enough. They created current rates in 2002, based on an estimated 1998 cost pool, increasing reimbursement for inflation only. \"It was never based on real cost collection,\" said Rick Sherlock , the association's ex-officio president and CEO.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the patients whom air ambulances transport fall into these categories that the industry argue significantly underpay, like patients with Medicare. This payment is significantly less than the cost of the transportation, Sherlock said.\n\n\"Medicare pays about 60% of the cost of the flight; Medicaid pays 35% or less. Self-paid patients pay a few cents on the dollar, and that has led to a crisis of being able to sustain the service,\" Eastlee said. That means about 7 out of 10 of the association's flights are under-reimbursed, he said.\n\nIf the government reimburses the industry more, Sherlock said, \"you eliminate the need to balance bill.\"\n\nThe insured pay the costs\n\nAnderson, who was billed $54,727.26 total for her air ambulance rescue from the Badlands, got a letter from the air ambulance company's lawyer when she wrote to protest the price. HIs letter explains that 75% of that company's patients are covered by the government or have no insurance at all.\n\n\"This governmentally mandated cost shifting means that their cost per transport must be borne by others,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"In other words, I may not have had $54,000 worth of treatment, but essentially, they have to make up their costs somehow,\" Anderson said. \"It's not fair at all.\"\n\n\"Some of these bills are pretty egregious, and these are consumers who have done everything right,\" Godfread said. \"They have health insurance, they ask questions ahead of time, and often, they don't get to make the choice. It's often the hospital or the EMTs that decide to fly, but consumers are the ones left paying the bills, and there's really no way for consumers to protect themselves.\"\n\nAndrei Courier learned that the hard way in June. He got a $41,063.78 bill after the in-network hospital where he took his son Jacob with breathing problems transferred the boy to an out-of-network hospital.\n\nJacob Courier's air ambulance hospital transfer cost $41,063.78.\n\n\"First, I could have driven to that other hospital faster,\" Courier said. \"We also had tried to do everything in-network. We did everything right insurance-wise, but we still faced this huge bill.\"\n\nHis insurance company picked up $8,960.49 of the bill, that meant he would be left paying $32,103.29 out-of-pocket.\n\n\"We work hard, we pay our bills on time, and this is how we are repaid,\" Courier said. \"It was so frustrating. That's money we would use for my son's college, not for a short helicopter ride.\"\n\nCourier made multiple phone calls to the company, a lawyer and the Mississippi insurance commissioner. He learned that the state has a law that prevents balance billing , which is when insurance covers part of the bill and the patient owes the rest. Eventually, the cost of the flight was forgiven.\n\n\"I don't know what the insurance commissioner said to the company, but I finally got a call and was told they weren't going to balance bill me,\" Courier said, but he's still upset.\n\nMed Trans Air Medical Transport, which ran the air ambulance that day, referred questions to the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nStates try to help\n\nOther state insurance offices say usually there's little they can do, beyond holding insurance companies to the letter of their policies. Most offices encourage patients to call with complaints.\n\nThough states like Mississippi have balance billing protection, that tactic has had limited success elsewhere, as the courts have ruled that laws affecting air ambulances are federal, not state, jurisdiction.\n\nNorth Dakota tried another approach. Its 2015 law required providers to disclose prices before the flight, upon request. Hospitals that referred a patient to the air ambulance company had to let the patient know the cost ahead of time unless the hospital determined that doing so would jeopardize their health or safety, in which case they would be exempt. The courts overturned that legislation, ruling that it was a federal matter.\n\nNorth Dakota's 2017 legislation requires hospitals to notify patients in non-emergency situations if the helicopter takes their insurance. \"We are optimistic. It is squarely in the claims process that we have the authority to regulate,\" Godfread said. \"It will, however, likely be appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services believes that the states can \"help patients right now and help address the issue of balance billing and take patients out of the middle,\" Eastlee said. \"Some insurance only covers a fraction of the price for those transports. We can work together.\"\n\nThe Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\" Virginia is trying another approach. Starting in March, its new law will require hospitals tell patients who don't have an \"emergency medical condition\" that they have a choice between air and ground transportation.The Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\"\n\nCongress and the law\n\nIt will probably take an act of Congress to regulate the air ambulance industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act , passed in October, created an advisory committee with all the players involved who will focus on improving price transparency. The law gives the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to create new rules. It establishes a hotline and website to track complaints, and it creates an aviation consumer advocate position.\n\n\"It was important to me that we craft a solution that not only empowers consumers and patients but lays the groundwork for long-term solutions in the industry,\" said US Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia, who added the air ambulance-specific language to the bill. \"By creating an aviation consumer advocate, much like the taxpayer advocate for those with complaints against the IRS, my amendment provides a clear mechanism through which consumers can pursue enforcement or corrective actions -- which to this point had been absent in these situations.\"\n\nThe industry association said that it supports the FAA Reauthorization Act because it \"enhanced consumer protection\" and that the industry does want more transparency and accountability, Eastlee said, \"but we also have to work to sustain the service.\"\n\nSherlock added, \"the amendment does not address the underlying problem to reduce the patient's balance bill .\"\n\nFor Anderson, Congress is too late. She took her own action. Instead of paying $41,029.53 out of pocket, she offered to settle for $4,100, on top of the $13,000 her insurance paid.\n\n\"I thought, I didn't want them to sue me and wanted to get this out of the way and thought 10% more was reasonable,\" Anderson said. For three months, she heard nothing from the company, so she wrote to withdraw her offer. The next month, the company offered to negotiate, documents show, but eventually, it accepted her offer.\n\nAnderson's recovered from her injuries. And Cody, her horse, is OK. She brought him some extra feed to thank him, as the X-rays detected another medical issue she is now in treatment for. But the experience with the air ambulance still bothers her.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"For a little more than 45 minutes of service, they were asking for more than what my surgeon charged. It's not fair,\" Anderson said. \"I've since talked to other people who have been transported with no surprise bills, I think air ambulances can run in a fair manner, but the way it is currently done seems unfair and unreasonable. No one should feel shocked or panicked by a bill like this.

To be included in the estimate, parents would have had to report that their child had ever received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and that they currently had the condition.\n\nThe new numbers were also slightly lower than those in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey. It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study's authors also note that universal screening recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to Frazier.\n\n\"Having prevalence estimates -- even if there is some variation -- helps us to advocate for improved screening, diagnosis, interventions and supports,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "AFM: CDC identifies 31 states with 116 confirmed cases of polio-like disease", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Xzbu7vS_wy4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There are now 286 cases of possible and confirmed acute flaccid myelitis in the United States this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThat includes 116 confirmed cases of the rare polio-like illness, also known as AFM, that leads to sudden onset of paralysis.

ethical trade, is asked to justify its low prices by Mary Creagh MP\n\nBig-name retailers have defended selling clothes for \u00a35 or less, saying their ability to sell clothes so cheaply is down to business models.\n\nMPs investigating the impact of so-called \"fast fashion\" asked the firms how they could justify such low prices.\n\nPrimark's spokesman Paul Lister said the firm spent nothing on advertising and had tight profit margins.\n\nRepresentatives from brands including Boohoo, Misguided, Asos, Burberry and Marks & Spencer also gave evidence.\n\nThe Commons environmental audit committee is examining the impact of clothes production, especially those items produced cheaply and quickly in response to trends - known as \"fast fashion\".\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nLabour MP Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, asked Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability, Paul Lister: \"How can you justify selling T-shirts in your stores for as little as \u00a32 or \u00a33, and how can you be making a profit on those?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Primark has never done any significant advertising at all, and that can save us in any year \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m, compared to some of our larger rivals. That goes straight into price. That keeps our pricing low.\"\n\n\"It's our business model that takes us to a \u00a32 T-shirt.\"\n\nOn waste, Mr Lister said Primark had very little unused stock and was planning to launch a take-back scheme for consumers next year, where old clothes can be returned and used again by overseas charities.\n\nMs Creagh suggested that by making garments so cheaply, they were being devalued.\n\nBut Mr Lister insisted: \"Every item that we make, we're looking at durability\u2026 we are proud of the quality and durability of our garments, they're not built to throw away.\"\n\nWhat is fast fashion?\n\nThe term describes our high rate of fashion consumption fuelled by the availability of new and cheap clothing.\n\nProducing clothes requires climate-changing emissions. Global textile production produces 1.2bn tonnes of carbon emissions a year - more than international flights and maritime shipping.\n\nLast month, MPs on another committee concluded that the fast fashion industry was a major source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet.\n\nMPs believe that the throwaway nature of fashion is also fuelling fast turnarounds among suppliers, which may result in poor working conditions.\n\nElsewhere, Carol Kane, joint CEO of online fashion house BooHoo, was asked how the company could sell dresses for as little as \u00a35 when the minimum wage was \u00a37.83.\n\nShe said this only applied to a small number of dresses intentionally sold at a loss, to drive more traffic to the site.\n\nMs Kane, asked if consumers were now too accustomed to cheap, disposable clothes, said: \"I believe this all comes back to consumer demand. I've been in the industry for 32 years, and in that time I've seen prices decline.\"\n\nSpeaking on the same issue, Jamie Beck, from the Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, said: \"These garments aren't designed to be a disposable item, to be bought for [just] a holiday. They're designed to be long-lasting.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Burberry has been criticised for destroying stock\n\nDuring the hearing, high-end fashion brand Burberry also defended criticism from MPs for dumping clothes.\n\nEarlier this year, the firm was strongly criticised for burning \u00a330m ($40m) of stock. It admitted destroying the unsold clothes, accessories and perfume instead of selling them off cheaply, in order to protect the brand's exclusivity and value.\n\nLeanne Wood, Burberry's chief of corporate affairs, told MPs the firm was \"committed\" to stopping the activity, but added: \"It is an industry practice. We're the only luxury business that's reported it in their accounts\u2026 but it is something that happens in the industry.\"\n\nBoohoo, Missguided and Asos were also quizzed on relationships with suppliers accused of exploiting workers in Britain.\n\nPaul Smith, head of product quality and supply at Missguided, said the firm had cut the number of businesses it worked with in Leicester - where many of the factories are based - from 35 to just 20 due to concerns about pay and conditions at some sites there.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Pretty Little Thing is one of Boohoo's brands\n\nAfter the hearing, Ms Creagh said: \"Evidence we heard today justifies our concerns that the current system allows fashion retailers to mark their own homework when it comes to workers' rights, fair pay and sustainability.\n\n\"Marks and Spencer are supposed to be a leading light in corporate responsibility, but even they pulled out of a scheme seeking to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining.\n\n\"Boohoo did not convince us that it had a grip on the potential illegal underpayment of their Leicester-based workers.\"\n\nShe added that it was \"shocking\" to learn during the hearing that Missguided staff who went to check on conditions at a factory were allegedly assaulted by its owners, adding that it \"begs the question - what on Earth was going on inside?\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: CO2 emissions rising for first time in four years", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46347453", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Carbon emissions have not yet peaked in many countries the report says\n\nGlobal efforts to tackle climate change are way off track says the UN, as it details the first rise in CO2 emissions in four years.\n\nThe emissions gap report says that economic growth is responsible for a rise in 2017 while national efforts to cut carbon have faltered.\n\nTo meet the goals of the Paris climate pact, the study says it's crucial that global emissions peak by 2020.\n\nBut the analysis says that this is now not likely even by 2030.\n\nThe report comes days before a major UN climate conference starting in Poland from 2-14 December.\n\nWhat is the emissions gap?\n\nFor the last nine years, UN Environment have produced an assessment of the latest scientific studies on current and future emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nIt highlights the difference between the level of greenhouse gas emissions that the world can sustain to keep temperatures within safe limits, with the levels that are likely based on the promises and actions taken by countries.\n\nThis year's report records the largest gap yet between where we are and where we need to be.\n\nWhy are emissions rising again?\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, global emissions of CO2 from industry and the production of energy were essentially stable while the global economy grew modestly - but in 2017 these emissions went up by 1.2% pushed along by higher GDP.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption While renewable energy sources are booming in countries like India, carbon emissions haven't yet peaked\n\nWhile the rise might seem small, it needs to be seen in context of efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C, as recently outlined in a key IPCC report.\n\nAccording to the UN, to keep the world below that target, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be 55% lower than today.\n\n\"There is still a tremendous gap between words and deeds, between the targets agreed by governments worldwide to stabilise our climate and the measures to achieve these goals,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and one of the authors of the study.\n\nThe scientists say that to tackle the gap, nations must raise their ambition five fold to meet the 1.5C goal.\n\nRight now, the world is heading for a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century the report says.\n\nNo peaking?\n\nOne key aspect of the study is about the peaking of global greenhouse emissions.\n\nThe report says that peaking of emissions in 2020 is \"crucial for achieving the temperature targets in the Paris agreement,\" but the scale of the current efforts is insufficient.\n\nThe study says that by 2030, around 57 countries representing about 60% of global emissions will have peaked. Nowhere near where the world needs to be.\n\nDoes the report point the finger at countries that are doing badly?\n\nIn some ways yes. The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The burning and clearing of forests in Asia contributes hugely to emissions\n\nThree countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets.\n\nThe authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans.\n\nIs there any positive news in the report?\n\nUndoubtedly, yes.\n\nThe UN is placing great hopes in what it terms \"non-state actors\", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap.\n\nThey estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action.\n\nBut the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.\n\nThe study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.\n\nThe future is fiscal?\n\nThe report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.\n\nIt says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets\n\n\"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.\n\n\"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries.\"\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThis report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators will be trying to finish the rules on how to implement the rule book of the Paris agreement - but the report's authors hope it can push countries to greater levels of ambition.\n\n\"Germany and Europe could demonstrate leadership in this area by pledging complete greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and a clear strengthening of the emission reduction targets for 2030,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Footage shows people-smuggling plans over Channel crossing", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46364929", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:18", "body_paragraphs": "Video\n\nPeople smugglers are telling migrants they must enter the UK before \"the borders shut properly\" after Brexit, a BBC South East investigation found.\n\nMore than 100 people, the majority claiming to be Iranian, have entered British waters in boats this month.\n\nAn undercover reporter found smuggling operations were being organised at makeshift camps in northern France.\n\nAuthorities said they wanted to stop a repeat of the Mediterranean crisis in which 2,000 migrants drowned this year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Ukraine-Russia sea clash: Captured sailors shown on Russia TV", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46356111", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:21", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the three men, Andriy Drach, was described as a Ukrainian security service employee\n\nStatements by three captured Ukrainians have been released by Russia's security service after Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats off the coast of Russian-annexed Crimea.\n\nOne of the men, Volodymyr Lisovyi, said he was aware of the \"provocative nature\" of the Ukrainian action.\n\nUkraine's navy commander said the men had been forced to lie under duress.\n\nMeanwhile, a Crimean court ordered that 12 of the 24 Ukrainians seized on Sunday be detained for 60 days.\n\nThe court is expected to issue rulings for the remaining servicemen on Wednesday.\n\nWestern nations have condemned Russia's use of force, four years after it seized Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula.\n\nWhy this crisis is fraught with risk\n\nThe flare-up is the first outright clash between Ukraine and Russian forces for years, although pro-Russian separatists and Russian \"volunteers\" have been fighting Ukraine's army in two eastern regions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high\n\nTensions escalated when Russia opened a bridge this year between Russia and Crimea over the Kerch Strait, which leads into the Sea of Azov.

Nowhere near where the world needs to be.\n\nDoes the report point the finger at countries that are doing badly?\n\nIn some ways yes. The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The burning and clearing of forests in Asia contributes hugely to emissions\n\nThree countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets.\n\nThe authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans.\n\nIs there any positive news in the report?\n\nUndoubtedly, yes.\n\nThe UN is placing great hopes in what it terms \"non-state actors\", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap.\n\nThey estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action.\n\nBut the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.\n\nThe study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.\n\nThe future is fiscal?\n\nThe report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.\n\nIt says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets\n\n\"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.\n\n\"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries.\"\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThis report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators will be trying to finish the rules on how to implement the rule book of the Paris agreement - but the report's authors hope it can push countries to greater levels of ambition.\n\n\"Germany and Europe could demonstrate leadership in this area by pledging complete greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and a clear strengthening of the emission reduction targets for 2030,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "No sale for Australia's enormous Knickers (who is, by the way, a bull)", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46357449", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:25", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Geoff Pearson Image caption Knickers is often followed by a herd of wagyu cattle\n\nKnickers looms above the thousands of other cattle that he feeds with in rural Western Australia.\n\nAt some 1,400kg (220st) and 194cm (6ft 4in), the seven-year-old is believed to be the biggest steer in a country home to millions of cattle.\n\nAnd his size has proved to be his saving grace.

the ruling, as his chance of success was \"not sufficient\".\n\nIt means Mr Conway's case cannot proceed any further.\n\nIn a joint statement the judges, Lady Hale, Lord Reed and Lord Kerr, said they had reached their decision \"not without some reluctance\".\n\nMr Conway, who was too ill to attend the hearing in London, said it is \"barbaric\" that he must choose between \"unacceptable options\" to end his life.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Mr Conway said his only option is to remove his ventilator, which he relies on 23-hours a day\n\nHe said the ruling was \"extremely

an unjustifiable interference with the right to respect for private life under the Human Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe three Supreme Court judges said it was open to them to declare the current law was incompatible with the Convention, and leave it to Parliament to decide what to do about it.\n\nBut the judges will have taken into consideration the overwhelming vote by MPs three years ago, to reject proposals to allow assisted dying.\n\nUltimately, while judges are there to interpret the law, it is only Parliament which can make them.\n\n\"No-one doubts that the issue is of transcendent public importance,\" the judges said.\n\n\"It touches us all... we all have to contemplate our own death.\"\n\nHowever, the court ruled Mr Conway's chances of a successful appeal were not sufficient

MP\n\nBig-name retailers have defended selling clothes for \u00a35 or less, saying their ability to sell clothes so cheaply is down to business models.\n\nMPs investigating the impact of so-called \"fast fashion\" asked the firms how they could justify such low prices.\n\nPrimark's spokesman Paul Lister said the firm spent nothing on advertising and had tight profit margins.\n\nRepresentatives from brands including Boohoo, Misguided, Asos, Burberry and Marks & Spencer also gave evidence.\n\nThe Commons environmental audit committee is examining the impact of clothes production, especially those items produced cheaply and quickly in response to trends - known as \"fast fashion\".\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nLabour MP Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, asked Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability, Paul Lister: \"How can you justify selling T-shirts in your stores for as little as \u00a32 or \u00a33, and how can you be making a profit on those?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Primark has never done any significant advertising at all, and that can save us in any year \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m, compared to some of our larger rivals. That goes straight into price. That keeps our pricing low.\"\n\n\"It's our business model that takes us to a \u00a32 T-shirt.\"\n\nOn waste, Mr Lister said Primark had very little unused stock and was planning to launch a take-back scheme for consumers next year, where old clothes can be returned and used again by overseas charities.\n\nMs Creagh suggested that by making garments so cheaply, they were being devalued.\n\nBut Mr Lister insisted: \"Every item that we make, we're looking at durability\u2026 we are proud of the quality and durability of our garments, they're not built to throw away.\"\n\nWhat is fast fashion?\n\nThe term describes our high rate of fashion consumption fuelled by the availability of new and cheap clothing.\n\nProducing clothes requires climate-changing emissions.

I've been in the industry for 32 years, and in that time I've seen prices decline.\"\n\nSpeaking on the same issue, Jamie Beck, from the Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, said: \"These garments aren't designed to be a disposable item, to be bought for [just] a holiday.

It admitted destroying the unsold clothes, accessories and perfume instead of selling them off cheaply, in order to protect the brand's exclusivity and value.\n\nLeanne Wood, Burberry's chief of corporate affairs, told MPs the firm was \"committed\" to stopping the activity, but added: \"It is an industry practice. We're the only luxury business that's reported it in their accounts\u2026 but it is something that happens in the industry.\"\n\nBoohoo, Missguided and Asos were also quizzed on relationships with suppliers accused of exploiting workers in Britain.\n\nPaul Smith, head of product quality and supply at Missguided, said the firm had cut the number of businesses it worked with in Leicester - where many of the factories are based - from 35 to just 20 due to concerns about pay and conditions at some sites there.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Pretty Little Thing is one of Boohoo's brands\n\nAfter the hearing, Ms Creagh said: \"Evidence we heard today justifies our concerns that the current system allows fashion retailers to mark their own homework when it comes to workers' rights, fair pay and sustainability.\n\n\"Marks and Spencer are supposed to be a leading light in corporate responsibility, but even they pulled out of a scheme seeking to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining.\n\n\"Boohoo did not convince us that it had a grip on the potential illegal underpayment of their Leicester-based workers.\"\n\nShe added that it was \"shocking\" to learn during the hearing that Missguided staff who went to check on conditions at a factory were allegedly assaulted by its owners, adding that it \"begs the question - what on Earth was going on inside?\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Theresa May denies 'rolling over' on deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46363879", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:38", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTheresa May has denied claims from DUP leader Arlene Foster that she had \"given up\" on negotiations before agreeing the Brexit deal.\n\nMrs Foster said the PM's trip to promote the deal to businesses in Wales and Northern Ireland was a \"waste of time\" as Parliament would not back it.\n\nMeanwhile, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the BBC the deal was \"doomed\" and must be renegotiated.\n\nMrs May insists it protects the \"vital interests\" of the whole of the UK.\n\nAfter enduring criticism of the Brexit withdrawal agreement in the Commons on Monday, the prime minister began the next day rejecting US President Donald Trump's suggestions that the deal could threaten future US-UK trade deals.\n\nAnd as she travelled to Wales and Northern Ireland, promising that her Brexit plans would strengthen \"every corner\" of the UK, she came under fire from Mrs Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact to support the Conservative government in key votes.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Foster: This is not the right deal for Northern Ireland\n\n\"The disappointing thing for me is that the prime minister has given up and she is saying... we just have to accept it,\" Mrs Foster told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg.\n\n\"She may have given up on further negotiations and trying to find a better deal but I have not.\"\n\nSir Michael Fallon's decision to come out against the deal is another blow to the prime minister, who is struggling to muster support in Parliament ahead of a Commons vote on 11 December.\n\nLabour, the Lib Dems, SNP and Democratic Unionists have all said they will reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal, and future relations negotiated by Mrs May.\n\nMany Tories have also said publicly they are opposed to Mrs May's Brexit deal with the EU.

terms of the UK's withdrawal and future relations negotiated by Mrs May on 11 December.\n\nSir Michael's decision to come out against the deal is a blow to the prime minister, who is struggling to muster support in Parliament for it.\n\nLabour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Democratic Unionists have said they will vote against the deal while many Tories have said publicly they are opposed.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mrs May has said Welsh farmers will enjoy a brighter future outside the Common Agricultural Policy\n\nOpponents of the deal say it will keep the UK too closely tied to EU rules and make it harder to strike future trade deals with other countries and minimise their value.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has suggested the withdrawal agreement \"sounds like a great deal for the EU\" and might hamper a future trade deal with the UK but Mrs May said this was not the case.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nOther political parties have demanded to be

MPs on Monday the agreement was a \"huge gamble\" as it would see the UK give up its power to influence EU rules and regulations in return for vague assurances over future trade arrangements.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today that \"this is not a good deal and we need a better deal\", saying that Mr Trump's criticism of its repercussions for transatlantic relations \"could not simply be brushed off\".\n\n\"My fear is that this deal gives us the worst of all worlds,\" he said. \"No guarantee of smooth trade in the future and no ability to reduce the tariffs that we need to conclude trade deals with the rest of the world.\n\n\"So, unless the House of Commons can be persuaded somehow that those are possible then I think, yes, the deal is doomed.\"\n\nAsked if Mrs May was also doomed, he replied \"that's up to my colleagues\", while stressing that a change of leader would not necessarily address the difficulties the UK now found itself in.\n\nWhen it was put to him that did not sound like an endorsement of Mrs May, he replied \"take it any way you want\".\n\nThe prominent Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin said there was a lot of \"personal sympathy\" for Mrs May but her authority when it came to the Brexit agreement was \"collapsing\".\n\nCould Brexit be delayed?\n\nSir Michael said the 29 March 2019 date for Brexit, which is enshrined in UK law, may have to be pushed back to give negotiators the time to make major improvements to the agreement.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Will MPs vote for Brexit?\n\nAll 28 EU states would need to agree to extend the Article 50 process of negotiations to allow this to happen, something Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out.\n\nCabinet Office David Lidington said he did not think doing this \"would get us anywhere\" as the EU had made clear this was the only deal on the table.\n\nHe told Today there was no \"Plan B\" and the agreement was a \"decent compromise\" which would provide a springboard to the next stage of negotiations on the two sides' future relationship.\n\nMay on Trump's trade deal comments\n\nThe prime minister is continuing to making the case for the agreement, which she says delivers on the 2016 referendum vote in key areas and is in the national interest.\n\nResponding to Mr Trump's comments, Downing Street has insisted the UK will be able to pursue an independent trade policy under the terms of the political declaration on future relations.\n\nDuring a visit to an agricultural show in Builth Wells, Powys, Mrs May said: \"As regards the United States, we have already been talking to them about the sort of agreement that we could have in the future.\n\n\"We have a working group set up and that is working very well, has met several times and is continuing to work with the US on this.\"\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, the UK would not be able to complete any trade deal with a country outside the EU until the end of the proposed transition period - currently scheduled to last until 31 December 2020.\n\nIn reality, any bilateral agreement between the UK and the US is likely to take years to negotiate given its complexity, differing standards in areas such as agriculture, and the fact it would require ratification by the US Congress."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Terminally

and effectively suffocate to death under sedation,\" he said. \"To me this is not acceptable.\"\n\nInstead, he wants medical assistance to die when he has less than six months to live, while he still

doctor to prescribe him a lethal dose of drugs to take once he is deemed to have less than six months to live.\n\nBut section 2 of the 1961 Suicide Act makes this illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison.\n\nMr Conway argued the current law is an unjustifiable interference with the right to respect for private life under the Human Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe three Supreme Court judges said it was open to them to declare the current law was incompatible with the Convention, and leave it to Parliament to decide what to do about it.\n\nBut the judges will have taken into consideration the overwhelming vote by MPs three years ago, to reject proposals to allow assisted dying.\n\nUltimately, while judges are there to interpret the law, it is only Parliament which can make them.\n\n\"No-one doubts that the issue is of transcendent public importance,\" the judges said.\n\n\"It touches us all... we all have to contemplate our own death.\"\n\nHowever, the court ruled Mr Conway's chances of a successful appeal were not sufficient \"to justify our giving him permission to pursue it, with all that that would entail for him, for his family, for those on all sides of

Back in 2000, 62% of patients survived for at least a year. By 2015, this proportion had risen to 72%.\n\nMeanwhile, five-year survival has increased from 42% to 53%.\n\nBut other nations have improved too. The Health Foundation highlighted the UK's performance against five other nations - Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThis was done for six key cancers - colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian and prostate.\n\nFor each, the UK has remained in the bottom two since 2000 for five-year survival. Only on breast cancer has it actually closed the gap with the best.\n\nThe think tank highlighted figures showing 10,000 deaths could be prevented each year with better diagnosis. That represents one in 13 deaths from the disease.\n\nWhat is the problem?\n\nSir Mike talks about the \"tight gate-keeping\" in the NHS.\n\nHe said GPs were under pressure not to refer too many patients, while the NHS did not have enough equipment or staff to carry out all the tests and scans it ideally should.\n\nTackling this would require major investment, the report said.\n\nGPs refer nearly two million patients a year for urgent tests and scans - nearly four times the number they did over a decade ago.\n\nBut the rise in referrals has coincided with long waiting times, with the NHS now struggling to meet its targets.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnd despite the extra numbers being referred, one in five cases is still diagnosed via an emergency presentation in places such as accident and emergency units.\n\nPatients diagnosed via this route are less likely to survive as the cancer has been diagnosed late.\n\nSir Mike said services had also been undermined by the 2012 Health and Care Act, which led to regional cancer specialist groups being scrapped as part of the wider shake-up of the health service.\n\nHe said this had prompted lots of experienced professionals to leave the NHS.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nSir Mike welcomed the fact the government had promised extra funding - \u00a320bn extra a year by 2023 - and that cancer would be a key focus for that.\n\nLast month, the prime minister promised a new strategy to ensure three-quarters of cancer were diagnosed early - currently only half are.\n\nNHS England is already piloting rapid diagnostic clinics. These are basically one-stop testing centres where patients can get access to a range of different specialists and procedures often on the same day.\n\nSir Mike said these steps would help.\n\nHe also called for more to be done to raise awareness among the public of the signs and symptoms to look out for - research shows people in the UK are sometimes reluctant to come forward when they are showing signs of cancer.\n\nAnd he said the NHS needed to look at new approaches, pointing to research showing people at high risk of lung cancer could benefit from a new form of screening for the disease by using low-dose CT scans.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said improving early diagnosis was a \"key priority\", pointing out from next year a new 28-day target for diagnosis would be rolled out.\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Safety concerns raised over breast implants", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46329824", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:49", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Implants can be \"textured\" or \"smooth\"\n\nAn investigation has raised safety concerns about the most commonly used type of silicone breast implant in the UK.\n\nWomen in France are now being advised not to use \"textured\" silicone implants while authorities investigate links with a rare form of cancer.\n\nBritish women are still having the implants put in and there has been no warning from the UK regulator to stop.\n\nIt says it will take action when it sees there is a problem.\n\nA Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) spokesman said: \"We know that there are ongoing concerns about the safety of silicone breast implants - we're keeping a very close eye on that.\"\n\nManufacturers say the safety of the implants is supported by extensive testing and studies, as well as more than a decade of use in America and Europe.\n\nThe BBC's Panorama programme has been investigating implants with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and organisations around the world, including the Guardian newspaper and the British Medical Journal.\n\n'Mortified'\n\nJanet Trelawny had breast cancer over 20 years ago.

The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The burning and clearing of forests in Asia contributes hugely to emissions\n\nThree countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets.\n\nThe authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans.\n\nIs there any positive news in the report?\n\nUndoubtedly, yes.\n\nThe UN is placing great hopes in what it terms \"non-state actors\", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap.\n\nThey estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action.\n\nBut the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.\n\nThe study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.\n\nThe future is fiscal?\n\nThe report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.\n\nIt says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets\n\n\"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.\n\n\"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries.\"\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThis report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators will be trying to finish the rules on how to implement the rule book of the Paris agreement - but the report's authors hope it can push countries to greater levels of ambition.\n\n\"Germany and Europe could demonstrate leadership in this area by pledging complete greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and a clear strengthening of the emission reduction targets for 2030,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "'Siberian unicorn' walked Earth with humans", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46358789", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright W S Van der Merwe Image caption Artist's impression of the 'forgotten beast'\n\nA giant rhino that may have been the origin of the unicorn myth survived until at least 39,000 years ago - much longer than previously thought.\n\nKnown as the Siberian unicorn, the animal had a long horn on its nose, and roamed the grasslands of Eurasia.\n\nNew evidence shows the hefty beast may have eventually died out because it was such a picky eater.\n\nScientists say knowing more about the animal's extinction could help save the remaining rhinos on the planet.\n\nRhinos are in particular danger of extinction because they are very picky about their habitat, said Prof Adrian Lister of the Natural History Museum, London, who led the study.\n\n\"Any change in their environment is a danger for them,\" he told BBC News. \"And, of course, what we've also learned from the fossil record is that once a species is gone, that's it, it's gone for good.\"\n\nWeighing in at a mighty four tonnes, with an extraordinary single horn on its head, the \"Siberian unicorn\", shared the earth with early modern humans up until at least 39,000 years ago.\n\nImage copyright Igor Doronin Image caption Skeleton of the rhino at the Stavropol Museum\n\nWhat do we know about the ancient rhino?\n\nThe rhino, Elasmotherium sibericum, was thought to have become extinct between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago.\n\nBy radiocarbon-dating a total of 23 specimens, researchers found the Ice Age giant in fact survived in Eastern Europe and Central Asia until at least 39,000 years ago.\n\nThey also isolated DNA from the ancient rhino for the first time, showing it split from the modern group of rhinos about 40 million years ago.\n\nThe extinction of the Siberian unicorn marks the end point of an entire group of rhinos.\n\nWhy might it have gone extinct?\n\nThe study also involved examining the animals' teeth, confirming they grazed on tough, dry grasses.\n\n\"It was walking along like a kind of prehistoric lawnmower really...it's just grazing along the ground,\" said Prof Lister.\n\nThe rhino's specialised diet may have been its downfall. As the Earth warmed up and started to emerge from the Ice Age around 40,000 years ago, grasslands started to shrink, likely pushing the animal to extinction.\n\nHundreds of large mammal species disappeared after the last Ice Age, due to climate change, loss of vegetation and human hunting.\n\nWhat does it tell us about the fate of modern rhinos?\n\nToday there are just five remaining species of rhino. Very few survive outside national parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over many decades.\n\nBy studying fossilised rhinos, scientists can learn more about the fate of the many prehistoric rhino species that once roamed the planet and how they adapted to climate change and human pressures.\n\nWhere do unicorn myths come from?\n\nLegends of the unicorn, or a beast with a single horn, have been around for millennia.\n\nSome have argued that the horn of the rhino may have been the basis of myths about unicorns, although other animals - such as the tusked narwhal - are more likely contenders.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mars: Nasa lands InSight robot to study planet's interior", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46351114", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright EPL Image caption InSight quickly returned its first image from Elysium Planitia\n\nThe US space agency Nasa has landed a new robot on Mars after a dramatic seven-minute plunge to the surface of the Red Planet.\n\nThe InSight probe aims to study the world's deep interior, and make it the only planet - apart from Earth - that has been examined in this way.\n\nConfirmation of touchdown came through on cue at 19:53 GMT.\n\nIt ended an anxious wait in which the robot radioed home a series of updates on its descent.\n\nNasa's mission control at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) erupted into cheers when it became clear InSight was safe on the ground.\n\nThe agency's chief administrator, James Bridenstine, celebrated what he called \"an amazing day\". President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that \"to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers.\"\n\nInSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator. Before landing, Nasa had dubbed it the \"biggest parking lot on Mars\".\n\nThe first picture of this landscape came back very quickly, within minutes. It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings.\n\nThe image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon.\n\nA later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance\n\nWhat happened in the landing?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California\n\nLike all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair.\n\nStage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress.\n\nIt had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop.\n\nInSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent.\n\nThe robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing.\n\nOne of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander.\n\nIt was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions.\n\nAnd as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars.\n\n\"Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,\" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth\n\nWhat is different about the InSight mission?\n\nThis will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German-led \"mole\" system will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bruce Banerdt: \"Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries\"\n\nWhy do we need to know this?\n\nScientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago.

Ben Ali, who held power for 23 years, has been a fugitive in Saudi Arabia since 2011.\n\n\"I was here yesterday and I came here again to say 'No' to the murderer and criminal, Mohammed bin Salman,\" Said Arous, a prominent human rights activist, told Al Jazeera, calling Khashoggi's killing \"an appalling crime\".\n\nThe crown prince - also known by his initials, MBS - arrived in Tunisia on Tuesday evening as part of a regional tour as he makes his way to the G20 summit set to take place in Argentina on Friday. In Tunis, he is expected to hold talks with the country's president and prime minister.\n\n'We cannot accept to receive or welcome a dubious crown prince.\"\n\n\n\nTunisians have been protesting a planned visit by Saudi's MBS.

The free Tunisian people are not for sale,\" Arous added, as if he was addressing MBS.\n\nProtesters also denounced a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, where a four-year war has spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"I left my children without lunch today and came down to this street, the street of the revolution, to say 'No' to this murderer and to urge Arab leaders to save the innocent children of Yemen,\" said Latifa, a stay-at-home mother, preferring to go only by her first name.\n\nCampaigners have long accused MBS of being the \"chief architect\" of the devastating war in Yemen, which is believed to have killed tens of thousands of people, including many children.\n\n\"Tunisia is pure now. If you have blood on your hands, don't come to Tunisia,\" said Latifa.\n\nG20 talks\n\nPrince Mohammed's next stop is Buenos Aires, where will attend the G20 meeting on November 30-December 1.\n\nIn Argentina's capital, he is expected to meet other world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who has given the crown prince a pass on Khashoggi's murder.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, a US-based rights group, has formally asked Argentina to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate MBS' alleged role in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen and the assassination of Khashoggi.\n\nArgentina recognises universal jurisdiction for war crimes and torture, which technically allows its judiciary to investigate and prosecute those crimes regardless of where they were committed.\n\nCases taking advantage of universal jurisdiction clauses have had success in the past. Still, Argentine media cited judicial sources in recent days as saying it was extremely unlikely for Buenos Aires to take up the case against MBS.\n\nSaudi authorities have repeatedly denied that MBS had any knowledge of the killing and its subsequent cover-up.\n\nArab flags raised\n\nBack at the protest site, Arous argued that the crown prince is also using his time abroad to promote the so-called \"deal of the century\", a term widely used to refer to Trump's plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nDetails of the plan have not yet been announced but media reports have suggested that the US had offered the Palestinian Authority a Jerusalem suburb as an alternative to East Jerusalem for the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nIn a controversial move last year, Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and later moved the US embassy there.\n\n\"He (MBS) wants to convince Arab presidents and kings to make Jerusalem the forever capital of the Zionist entity,\" said Arous.\n\nTunisia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, and any activity perceived as normalisation with the Israeli state is banned under the law.\n\nIn 2016, Mohammed al-Zawari, a Tunisian aviation engineer who the Palestinian group Hamas said was one of its members, was assassinated in his home in Tunisia's coastal region. His killing was blamed on the Israeli national intelligence agency Mossad.\n\nBut Tunisians' anger towards Israel goes beyond a pro-Palestinian sentiment. In 1985, an Israeli air raid on the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization south of the capital killed more than 30 people, including Tunisian citizens.\n\nFlags from several African countries could be seen in Tuesday's protest, most visibly those of Egypt and Algeria. Their presence, protesters said, was meant to convey the presence of a widespread sentiment against the Saudi de-facto ruler's trip across the region, regardless of the Arab governments' ties with him.\n\nBefore arriving in Tunis, MBS had already visited the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. In Cairo, he was greeted warmly on Monday by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in what Egyptian media dubbed as a \"protest of love\".\n\nTarek Hussein, an Egyptian human rights lawyer residing in Tunis, said it meant a lot to him to see his country's flag raised in Tuesday's protest.\n\n\"The Tunisian people came out today to show other Arab dictatorships that the Arab people could still go out to the streets and express their anger,\" he said."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Russia warns of escalation in Crimea over martial law in Ukraine", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/russia-warns-escalation-crimea-martial-law-ukraine-181127102513609.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Ukraine is to blame for the confrontation in Crimea, as Moscow warned that the conflict could escalate because of Kiev's decision to declare martial law.\n\nIn a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday, Putin said he is \"seriously concerned\" about the weekend naval standoff off the coast of Crimea between the Ukrainian navy and Russia's coastguard, which saw the latter seizing three Ukrainian ships and their crew.\n\nThe Russian president accused Ukraine of provoking the confrontation for political reasons.\n\nMerkel's spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, said the chancellor in the conversation with Putin stressed the need for de-escalation and dialogue.\n\nHours after the phone call between Moscow and Berlin, the Kremlin also issued a follow-up statement denouncing the martial law in Ukraine.\n\n\"The imposition of martial law in some regions may pose a risk of escalating tensions in the conflict-hit region, namely the south-east,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in comments carried by the state news agency, TASS.\n\nUkraine's leadership responded to the weekend clash by imposing martial law throughout much of the country on Monday, just as the UN held an emergency session to discuss the escalating tensions.\n\nCourt appearances\n\nMeanwhile, a Crimean court on Tuesday ordered five of 24 captured Ukrainian sailors to be held in jail for two months for their involvement in the incident.\n\nOn Wednesday, 12 more will appear in court after Russia accused them of illegally entering its territorial waters.\n\nSeveral others are still in the hospital for treatment.\n\nDjamil Temishev, a lawyer for sailor Roman Mokryak, said the sailors' cases will be handed over to Moscow after the Crimean court determines their fate.\n\nThe 24 sailors were caught on Sunday after Russia seized two Ukrainian navy ships and one tugboat near the Kerch Strait.\n\nUkraine Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko wrote an official letter to the Ukrainian sailors, which was passed on to them through their lawyer, showing them support.\n\n\n\n\"It is normal to be afraid.

Around 40 people were arrested, primarily counterprotesters supporting Zwarte Piet, who attacked anti-racist demonstrators with eggs and bananas, and in some places, Hitler salutes.\n\nIn Eindhoven and Rotterdam, the counterprotests in support of Black Pete were particularly intense, with reports that extreme right-wing supporters had dressed up as Zwarte Piet, and handed out candy and right-wing political party stickers to children.\n\nWe were threatened by these people, very aggressively. They even did the Hitler sign, and in some places white power signs. It was a like a weekend of Dutch racism in full display Jerry Afriyie, anti-racism campaigner\n\nJerry Afriyie, along with Quinsy Gario, was one of the two founders of the Zwarte Piet is Racisme campaign in 2011.\n\nHe said: \"There were bananas thrown at us. There were eggs thrown at us. We were called all types of racists slurs. We were threatened by these people, very aggressively. They even did the Hitler sign, and in some places white power signs. It was a like a weekend of Dutch racism in full display, and people saw it.\n\n\"A lot of people were shocked, but you know who was not shocked? Black people are not shocked. We have been saying it.\"\n\nAfriyie arrived in the Netherlands from Ghana when he was 10.\n\n\"They would call me Zwarte Piet, or you are dirty just like Zwarte Piet. You are only good to be Zwarte Piet.\"\n\nUntil then, he thought the Sinterklaas festivities were just about fun and collecting sweets.\n\n\"I was a child and not politically aware, but I realized we played this dress up with this character who is dumb, who is silly, who doesn't know much, who needs someone to lead the way, who keeps messing up, who is looking very ugly, and then realising that I am the butt of the joke, I was 12 years old when I realised it.\n\n\"So, I was like hold on, this thing that I thought was fun seems to be that I am the star of this play without knowing it, and definitely not the role I want to have. On the bus, people would throw those candies they make for Sinterklaas season, they would throw it at you making monkey sounds.\"\n\nHe tried to engage both students and teachers in a dialogue, but as he puts it, the country just looked away.\n\nMany people in the Netherlands support Black Pete, and a majority of the country seems resistant to changing the tradition.\n\nIn a controversial statement in 2014 that has gone viral, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: \"Black Pete is black and I can not change that because his name is Black Pete.\"\n\n\"It is not green Pete, or brown Pete, it is Black Pete \u2026 I can only say that my friends in the Dutch Antilles they are very happy when they have Sinterklaas because they don't have to paint their faces, and when I am playing Black Pete I am for days trying to get the stuff off my face.\"\n\nThe exact origins of Black Pete are mired in myth and controversy. Dutch people have a slightly different origin story depending on when and where they grew up - in the big cities of the industrial west or in rural parts of the rest of the country.\n\nThe basic story of Sint-Nikolaas, or Sinterklaas, in the Netherlands is that he comes from Spain, arriving by steamship, with a black helper, who, when his sack of toys was empty, would fill his bag with children who had been bad and return to Spain.\n\nMost would agree that it was a schoolteacher from Amsterdam, Jan Schenkman, who first introduced the character of Zwarte Piet in an illustrated book, Sint Nikolaas en zijn Knecht, in 1850.\n\nIt was a time when the Netherlands was still deeply engaged in the slave trade. The Netherlands didn't abolish slavery in its territories until 1863.\n\nHistorian Lise Koning has written about the link between Zwarte Piet and the blackface minstrel shows created in America in the 1800s that were known throughout Europe.\n\nOthers connect Zwarte Piet to traditional narratives from the Middle Ages in which Saint Nicholas was paired with a dark helper who represented a tamed devil or evil character.\n\nWhatever the exact origins, it is clear that the character of Zwarte Piet is a tradition and history that many Dutch have yet to come to terms with.\n\nWil Eikelboom, a human rights lawyer in Amsterdam who represents many in the anti-Black Pete movement, says he grew up with a \"Chimney Piet\" myth, \"who was black because he came through the chimney and was a harmless helper. It was embarrassingly late when I realised that if he came through the chimney you don't have thick red lips or black curly hair, this is probably a stereotype of a black man, and this had to be pointed out to me by protesters.\"\n\n\"To accept that a part of your childhood memory is in hindsight a racist thing is very difficult for a lot of people.\"\n\nA typical refrain from those who don't want change is that the festival is \"for the children\", but Afriyie sees it differently.\n\nHe lives in a black community, Amsterdam Southeast, and was raised there.\n\n\"I was trying to do my part to put some pride into these young black girls and boys, be proud of who you are, because we have seen many examples of children coming home and jumping in the shower trying to wash their skin off because the children at school are teasing them that they are ugly, that they are dirty.\n\n\"One girl recently was asking why can other kids get clean but I can't? Why is my dirtiness permanent? And she was referring to her skin.\"\n\nPeople are free to do Shabbat, Ramadan, pray three times a day but a Dutch person is not free to celebrate Black Pete? It's an outrage. Jonathan, hospitality entrepreneur\n\nThe Black Pete narrative has already changed in Amsterdam in recent years.\n\nNow, it is common to see white people with dark smudges of makeup, in place of the previous Piets in blackface.\n\nBut not far outside of Amsterdam, it is not difficult to find people celebrating as Zwarte Piet wearing blackface.\n\nJust 20 minutes north of Amsterdam lies the small idyllic tourist centre of Zaandam, with windmills and chocolate factories.\n\nThis year Zandaam hosted the main Sinterklaas arrival parade on November 17, televised live by the largest Dutch broadcaster, NTR.\n\nToday, anti-racist protestors peacefully calling for the abolition of 'Black Pete' \u2013 the blackface servant of the Dutch Santa Claus \u2013 were spat on by bystanders, attacked by violent mobs, and beaten by the police officers supposedly in charge of their protection. \u2014 Tom Vandeputte (@tvandeputte) November 17, 2018\n\nEven though the broadcaster said in October there would be no Zwarte Piet characters in blackface, Zwarte Piets were there by the busload, 150 in total, escorted by dozens of police officers. No protesters were allowed near the event.\n\nIn a traditional Dutch bar, Jonathan, a hospitality entrepreneur sits watching a football match. He's reluctant to comment at first, but eventually says that he believes the Black Pete debate is ridiculous.\n\n\"If there is one country where people don't discriminate, it's the Netherlands. Why do all Dutch traditions have to be ruined? People are free to do Shabbat, Ramadan, pray three times a day but a Dutch person is not free to celebrate Black Pete? It's an outrage. In all honesty, I think it's a political game. It's a distraction from the things that really matter.\"\n\n\"Black Pete is not about Black Pete,\" says Lambrecht Wessels, who works in the NGO sector.\n\nHe sees the growing battle over Sinterklaas' helper as a proxy for much larger issues in the country, mainly rapidly changing demographics, economic insecurity and a lack of a proper migration policy, all of which have fuelled a recent rise of nationalist politics in the Netherlands.\n\n\"People's fears are expressed through Black Pete. When these other issues are addressed, then people will be more ready to change Black Pete to sooted Pete, or chimney Pete.\"\n\nWhile some feel that those changes are still not enough, Afriyie is optimistic about the progress being made.\n\nHe spends much of his time talking to schools about race and Zwarte Piet.\n\n\"A lot of schools have changed Zwarte Piet. Utrecht has changed, this year Rotterdam says they will do like Amsterdam next year. When we started there was this big Goliath, now we see the big group is getting smaller and the small group is getting larger.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: when Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet leave the Netherlands on December 6, the controversy of Black Pete will remain, awaiting their arrival next year."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

Less than six months later, the facility has expanded into a detention camp holding thousands of teenagers - and it shows every sign of becoming more permanent.\n\nBy Monday, 2,349 largely Central American boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 17 were sleeping inside the highly guarded facility in rows of bunk beds in canvas tents, some of which once housed first responders to Hurricane Harvey. More than 1,300 teens have arrived since the end of October alone.\n\nRising from the cotton fields and dusty roads not far from the dark fence marking the border between the U.S. and Mexico, the camp has rows of beige tents and golf carts that ferry staffers carrying walkie-talkies. Teens with identical haircuts and government-issued shirts and pants can be seen walking single file from tent to tent, flanked by staff at the front and back.\n\nMore people are detained than Tornillo's tent city than in all but one of the nation's 204 federal prisons, yet construction here continues.\n\nThe camp's population may grow even more if members of the migrant caravans castigated by President Trump enter the U.S. Federal officials have said they may fly teens from the caravans who arrive in San Diego directly to El Paso, then bus them to Tornillo, according to a nonprofit social service provider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter.\n\nAn Associated Press investigation has found that the camp's rapid growth has created problems, including:\n\nCosts appear to be soaring more than 50 percent higher than the government has disclosed: What began as an emergency, 30-day shelter has transformed into a vast tent city that could cost taxpayers more than $430 million.\n\nThe government is allowing the nonprofit running the tent city to sidestep mental health care requirements: Under federal policy, migrant youth shelters generally must have one mental health clinician for every 12 kids, but shelter officials told AP the facility has just one mental health clinician for every 50 kids.\n\nFederal plans to close Tornillo by New Years' Eve will be nearly impossible to meet: There aren't 2,300 extra beds in other facilities. A contract obtained by AP shows the project could continue into 2020 and planned closures have already been extended three times since this summer.\n\nTornillo's teens were not separated from their families at the border this summer, but they're held there because federal immigration policies have resulted in the detention of a record 14,000 migrant children, filling shelter beds around the country to capacity. Almost all came on their own from Central America hoping to join family members in the United States.\n\nSome children have been detained at Tornillo since the tent camp opened in June. As the population inside the tall wire fences swells, and as some children stay there longer, the young detainees' anguish has deepened.\n\n\u201cThe few times they let me call my mom I would tell her that one day I would be free, but really I felt like I would be there for the rest of my life,\u201d a 17-year-old from Honduras who was held at Tornillo earlier this year told AP. \u201cI feel so bad for the kids who are still there. What if they have to spend Christmas there? They need a hug, and nobody is allowed to hug there.\u201d\n\nAfter his family passed extensive background checks, the teen was recently released to them, but said he still has nightmares he's back inside. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from immigration authorities.\n\nConfining and caring for so many children is a challenge. By day, minders walk the teen detainees to their meals, showers and recreation on the arid plot of land guarded by multiple levels of security. At night the area around the camp, that's grown from a few dozen to more than 150 tents, is secured and lit up by flood lights.\n\nThe nonprofit social service agency contracted to run Tornillo says it is proud of its work. It says it is operating the facility with the same precision and care used for shelters put up after natural disasters.\n\n\"We don't have anything to hide. This is an exceptionally run operation,\u201d said Krista Piferrer, a spokeswoman for BCFS Health and Human Services, a faith-based organization that runs Tornillo. \u201cThis isn't our first rodeo.\u201d\n\nShe said they have no guidance from the Trump administration regarding what will happen after Dec. 31.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mark Weber, said no decisions have been made about whether Tornillo will close by year's end as scheduled.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is we decide to do, in the very near future, we'll do a public notice about that,\u201d he said.\n\n'Nobody knows'\n\nMore than 50 years of research show institutionalizing young people is traumatizing, with harmful impacts on their psyche and life trajectories, prompting policymakers to seek alternatives to locking up children, said Naomi Smoot, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition for Juvenile Justice.\n\n\u201cHearing that more than 2,000 kids are in any kind of detention facility is alarming to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's not where kids should be around the holidays, particular when they haven't broken the law.\u201d\n\nMost of the children locked inside Tornillo are never charged with a crime; crossing illegally into the U.S. is a civil offense. By law, migrant children traveling alone into the U.S. must be sent to a government shelter where they stay until they can be united with relatives or other sponsors while awaiting immigration court hearings. Migrant children's time in government custody has grown longer this year, in part due to the Trump administration's new requirements for deep background checks on sponsors who agree to take in young immigrants.\n\nTornillo currently has 3,800 beds for the teens, with 1,400 of those on reserve.\n\nAnnunciation House director Ruben Garcia, whose El Paso nonprofit works with recent immigrants, said Tornillo is far more secretive than other government shelters, where he and his staff are routinely allowed inside. At Tornillo workers must sign non-disclosure agreements and visitors are rarely allowed.\n\n\u201cWhat's happening inside? Nobody knows. They cannot speak about what they see,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've been doing this work for 20 years and we've never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nBCFS says the shelter at Tornillo has actually had more media, elected officials, advocacy organizations, child welfare experts and attorneys tour the site than any other operation for migrant children run by HHS. The nonprofit said confidentiality agreements are standard, to protect the privacy and rights of clients and those served.\n\n'Counting the days'\n\nIn June, as migrant child detention centers overflowed, HHS announced it was opening a rapidly built tent city at Tornillo, with the idea that most kids would only stay a few days. But within the week there was talk of making a detention camp 10 times as big.\n\nBecause the detention camp is on federal property - part of a large U.S. Customs and Border facility - it is not subject to state licensing requirements.\n\nBCFS, a San Antonio nonprofit, runs Tornillo as it operates evacuation centers for hurricanes: there's food, first aid, activities and rows of bunk beds, but no normal-life activities for stressed-out teens, like formal school or unsupervised stretches.\n\nFederal officials have said repeatedly that only children without special needs were being sent to Tornillo. But facility administrators recently acknowledged to care providers that the Tornillo detainees included children with serious mental health issues who needed to be transferred out to facilities in El Paso in the coming days, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The person spoke on a condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about discussions.\n\nBCFS confirmed that the current ratio of mental-health clinicians to children is 1 to 50, and said that each child sees a mental health specialist every day.\n\n\u201cWhen a child is found to have a mental health need that cannot be best provided for at Tornillo, a request is made to HHS to transfer the child to a more appropriate facility,\u201d said Piferrer.\n\nDr. Ryan Matlow, a Stanford clinical psychologist whose work addresses the impact of early life stress, recently interviewed teens at Tornillo. He questions the facility's capacity to identify kids with special mental health needs given the large number of children and their tendency to suppress emotional distress in order to cope.\n\n\u201cThe kids are able to get by in there, but the more time they spend in these sorts of facilities, the greater the consequences, especially when it comes to their emotional and psychological well-being,\u201d said Matlow. \u201cIt's a dangerous and harmful system for kids to be caught in.\u201d\n\nCamilo Perez-Bustillo, who served as a Spanish-language interpreter at the camp earlier this month, said most of the two dozen children he met showed signs of depression and anxiety over when, or whether, they would be released. About two thirds are boys, and half of the teens are Guatemalan. There are no on-site interpreters for teens of indigenous origin who speak Spanish as a second language.\n\n\u201cThey are all counting the days they are inside the way prisoners do,\u201d said Perez-Bustillo, who is advocacy director at the nonprofit Hope Border Institute. \u201cMany of the kids have the sense of being suspended, and anxiousness about how much longer they will be held there.\u201d\n\nDr. Elizabeth Carll, a teen and trauma specialist who heads the American Psychological Association's Refugee Mental Health resource network, said institutionalizing so many teens in a geographically remote place makes it harder to recruit qualified clinicians.\n\n\u201cYou have to find people who are licensed, who are experts in trauma, who speak Spanish and have worked with teens,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere would you find all these qualified professionals?\u201d\n\nMaking things worse, Carll said migrant youth are likely to have higher emotional needs after going through hardship, enduring the journey north and being held in detention. They would do better if placed with trained, bilingual foster families, she said.\n\nOne shy 16-year-old from Honduras held at Tornillo told an AP reporter as she awaited her immigration court hearing that she was worried that it was taking so long to reunite her with family in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI'm getting tired of waiting because I've been there three months,\u201d said the girl, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by staffers who were monitoring her and other Tornillo detainees. \u201cI'm trying to keep the faith that I will be liberated soon.\u201d\n\n$1,200 per night\n\nFor each night each child spends at Tornillo, taxpayers spend up to $1,200 to pay the direct care workers, cooks, cleaners, teachers and emergency services workers, according to information staff at two congressional offices said they were provided on a recent visit. That's well above the $775 officials have publicly disclosed, and close to five times more than a typical youth migrant shelter costs.\n\nBCFS did not dispute the cost, but said on average, actual costs are closer to $750 a day, which would bring current operations to more than $12 million a week.\n\nThe costs at Tornillo are so high because everything - water, sewage, food, staff and detainees - must be trucked in and out of the remote site. Every few hours, two teams fill up 2,000-gallon tanks of water from a hydrant outside the facility, then drive them back through the fences. Each day, 35,000 gallons of diesel are trucked in as well, to run massive generators that power air conditioners in blazing hot summers and heaters on frigid winter nights.\n\nThe teens can play soccer during closely watched recreation periods. They are given yarn to pass the time making brightly colored bracelets and scarves. There aren't regular classes, but teens have textbooks and workbooks.\n\nPiferrer said BCFS was not charging the government for the tents, fire trucks and ambulance on site.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to charge for resources that we already own,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything that is being provided has been directed by the federal government to be provided.\u201d\n\nScant details about how those funds are spent motivated New York-based software developer Josh Rubin to set up residence in an RV just outside the gates, where he keeps a vigil on the vehicles going in and out. In recent weeks, he said, he has spotted new trends: construction trucks moving equipment in to build another tent, a vehicle carrying heaters, more buses with tinted windows taking children to immigration court.\n\nStaffers are transported to the camp from motels near the El Paso airport, where the tour buses take pains to park on side roads, far from view. On a recent evening outside the Hawthorn Suites hotel, Tornillo workers filed off to bed in the darkness, many talking of feeling sick or exhausted.\n\nTwice a day, the desolate stretch of highway outside Tornillo comes alive as more than a dozen tour buses pull up. Bells sound, lights flash. Workers walk in two by two, wearing khaki pants, neon jackets and backpacks, some wrapped in scarves to guard against the cool desert air.\n\nMany days, Rubin is there alone, holding up a sign saying \u201cFree Them\u201d at the tent city's entrance. Sometimes the train rumbles by, or cotton drifts in the wind.\n\nProtests began at Tornillo almost as soon as it opened. State and federal elected officials joined local activists and Hollywood stars deriding the Trump administration's immigration policies. But public attention turned elsewhere, and now demonstrations are rare.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, a group of about 60 activists including rabbis from Ann Arbor, Michigan and students from a local Catholic girls' school assembled to pray for the teens' release and sang a throaty version of \u201cLet My People Go.\u201d\n\nAfter a Department of Homeland Security official blocked them, the group ventured through a fence onto a private dirt road behind the facility. A group of teen boys could be seen across marshland, and a hole in the wire fence had been visibly patched.\n\n\u201cYou are not alone!\u201d the activists cried out in Spanish to the youth being led between tents. Some of the teens waved back. One protester wiped away a tear as another banged on a plastic drum, calling out \u201cWe love you! We miss you!\u201d\n\nDalila Reynoso-Gonzalez, a program director for the Methodist immigration advocacy group Justice for our Neighbors of East Texas, said she was moved to demonstrate at Tornillo after helping an immigrant father reunite with his son held there. The boy told her stories of a stark and lonely place and spoke of isolation, fear, disorientation.\n\nHe still has a foil blanket issued to him when he first was taken into custody, she said.\n\n\u201cIt's really heavy on my heart,\u201d said Reynoso-Gonzalez. \u201cHow did we get to this place, why do we have so many children out there?\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Ambassador Angers Poles With Letter to Prime Minister", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ambassador-angers-poles-with-letter-to-prime-minister/4676293.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. ambassador to Poland has triggered anger on social media with a letter allegedly sent to the prime minister that takes his government to task over its treatment of a U.S.-owned independent television station.\n\nThe letter on embassy letterhead and signed by Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher circulated in Polish media Tuesday.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, and her Democratic challenger, Mike Espy, in an election that has recalled images of the state's racist past.\n\nThe runoff election in the deeply conservative, Republican stronghold is being held because neither Hyde-Smith, who is white, nor Espy, who is black, won a majority of votes in a four-way race held three weeks ago.\n\nHyde-Smith, appointed to the seat when Sen. Thad Cochran resigned for health reasons, and Espy, a former U.S. agriculture secretary, are looking to fill the remaining two years of Cochran's term and would face another election in 2020.\n\nRed state, confederate past\n\nHyde-Smith appeared headed to winning the contest, in part because Mississippi has a long history of electing Republicans and has not elected a black senator for more than a century. But comments she made during the run-off campaign raised doubts about the outcome, prompting President Donald Trump to stage two election-eve rallies in the state to show his support.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he tweeted, \"We need Cindy Hyde-Smith in Washington.\"\n\nMississippi was one of 13 southern U.S. states that seceded from the United States in the 1860s over the rights of white plantation owners to possess slaves, declaring themselves the Confederate States of America. The secession led to the country's deadly Civil War that ended with the South's defeat and surrender in 1865.\n\nBut racial disputes endured for decades in Mississippi, with lynchings of black residents and segregation of the races in virtually all aspects of life, including schools, restaurants and other public accommodations, until the 1960s.\n\nLynching comments\n\nHyde-Smith drew quick scorn when she said that if a political supporter invited her \"to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" She apologized \"to anyone offended\" by the remark, but photos of her also surfaced of her holding Confederate memorabilia from the Civil War.\n\nIn another campaign comment, she suggested \"maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult\" for liberal college students to vote.\n\nHyde-Smith contended that Espy had misconstrued her lynching remarks. But the Democrat rebuffed her.\n\n\"No one twisted your comments because your comments were live, it came out of your mouth. I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth. It's caused our state harm. It's given our state another black eye that we don't need,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, state authorities removed two nooses and six hate signs they found on the grounds of the Mississippi State Capitol.\n\nCorruption charges\n\nRepublicans have depicted Espy as out of touch with the state, where he once served as a congressman, and lacking in judgment. He once faced corruption charges \u2014 receiving favors while he was the country's agriculture chief in the 1990s \u2014 although he was acquitted.\n\nIf Hyde-Smith wins, Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, compared to the current 51-49 edge. An Espy win would limit the Republican gain to a single seat. Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the November 6 voting for the first time in eight years, gaining at least 38 seats, with two tight contests still undecided."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Energy Nominee Clears Hurdle After Fossil-fuel Remarks", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-energy-nominee-clears-hurdle-after-fossil-fuel-remarks/4676269.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "A Senate committee has approved the Trump administration's nominee for the top federal energy board after a video surfaced showing him declaring that renewable energy \"screws up\" the nation's electrical grid.\n\nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 13-10 for Bernard McNamee's nomination to the Federal Energy Regulation Commission.\n\n\n\nMcNamee had worked on a stalled Trump administration effort to bail out struggling coal plants.\n\n\n\nIn the video, McNamee declares that fossil fuels and nuclear energy \"keep the lights on.\" The video also showed him saying renewable fuel \"screws up ... the physics of the grid\" providing the nation's electricity.\n\n\n\nMembers of the committee expressed concern about the video.

Since his first day in office, he has worked to undo regulations that aim to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. The focus has been on boosting the economy.\n\nAccording to the government's new report, failing to cut those emissions ultimately will take a significant toll on economic output.\n\nSince the last congressionally mandated report was issued four years ago, scientists have developed a more granular understanding of how climate change will affect particular regions of the United States, and they better understand \"how some of the damage caused by climate-related events is uniquely attributable to climate change, as opposed to what would happen normally,\" said Andrew Light, distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and co-author of the chapter on mitigation.\n\nThe report tallied up $118 billion per year in damage to coastal property by the end of the century, along with a $20 billion hit to roads and $1 billion to bridges.\n\nIt also says deaths from extreme temperatures will cause $141 billion in losses per year. Increases in rates of one disease \u2014 West Nile Virus \u2014 will cost $3 billion per year.\n\nThe Trump administration dismissed the report as alarmist.\n\n\"The report is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends\" said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. It assumes that, \"despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation.\"\n\nIn announcing his intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, Trump cited a study funded in part by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that said the United States would lose 2.7 million jobs and nearly $3 trillion of gross domestic product by 2040.\n\nCritics questioned those figures, especially since, as the report itself notes, it does not take into account benefits of reduced emissions.\n\nOthers see significant opportunities in cutting greenhouse gases.\n\nNearly 500 companies have pledged to reduce their emissions to meet their portion of the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\"These guys are not doing it for the good of the planet,\" said Wesleyan University economist Gary Yohe. \"It's because the bottom line says this is a good idea.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "China Launches Probe Into 'First' Gene-Edited Babies", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/china-launches-probe-into-first-gene-edited-babies/4676645.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "A Chinese researcher\u2019s surprise claim that he is the first person in the world to successfully edit the genes of a pair of recently born twin girls, making them resistant to HIV, the AIDS virus, has been met with criticism, scorn and denial in China.\n\n\n\nProvincial health authorities in the southern province of Guangdong released a statement Tuesday announcing that an investigation into the experiment, which involved seven couples and one successful pregnancy, already is under way and being given utmost attention.\n\n\n\n\u201cResults of the investigation will be promptly released to the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nContinuous denials\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Health said it was placing a high priority on the case and that it ordered the probe.

New Brazilian government data show the rate of deforestation \u2014 a major factor in global warming \u2014 has already increased over the past year.\n\n\n\nBrazil contains about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest, and scientists are worried.\n\n\n\nIt's nearly impossible to overstate the importance of the Amazon rainforest to the planet's living systems, said Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\n\nEach tree stores carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. The Amazon takes in as much as 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year and releases 20 percent of the planet's oxygen, earning it the nickname \"the lungs of the planet.\"\n\n\n\nIt's also a global weather-maker.\n\n\n\nStretching 10 times the size of Texas, the Amazon is the world's largest rainforest. Billions of trees suck up water through deep roots and bring it up to their leaves, which release water vapor that forms a thick mist over the rainforest canopy.\n\n\n\nThis mist ascends into clouds and eventually becomes rainfall \u2014 a cycle that shapes seasons in South America and far beyond.\n\n\n\nBy one estimate, the Amazon creates 30 to 50 percent of its own rainfall.\n\n\n\nNow the integrity of all of three functions \u2014 as a carbon sink, the Earth's lungs, and a rainmaker \u2014 hangs in the balance.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bolsonaro promised to loosen protections for areas of the Brazilian Amazon designated as indigenous lands and nature reserves, calling them impediments to economic growth. \"All these reserves cause problems to development,\" he told supporters.\n\n\n\nHe has also repeatedly talked about gutting the power of the environmental ministry to enforce existing green laws.\n\n\n\n\"If Bolsonaro keeps his campaign promises, deforestation of the Amazon will probably increase quickly \u2014 and the effects will be felt everywhere on the planet,\" said Paulo Artaxo, a professor of environmental physics at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\n\nBolsonaro's transition team did not respond to an interview request from the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nBrazil was once seen as a global environmental success story. Between 2004 and 2014, stricter enforcement of laws to safeguard the rainforest \u2014 aided by regular satellite monitoring and protections for lands designated reserves for indigenous peoples \u2014 sharply curbed the rate of deforestation, which peaked in the early 2000s at about 9,650 square miles a year (25,000 square kilometers).\n\n\n\nAfter a political crisis engulfed Brazil, leading to the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, enforcement faltered. Ranchers and farmers began to convert more rainforest to pastureland and cropland. Between 2014 and 2017, annual deforestation doubled to about 3,090 square miles (8,000 square kilometers). Most often, the trees and underbrush cut down are simply burned, directly releasing carbon dioxide, said Artaxo.\n\n\n\n\"In the Brazilian Amazon, far and away the largest source of deforestation is industrial agriculture and cattle ranching,\" said Emilio Bruna, an ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville.\n\nNow observers are parsing Bolsonaro's campaign statements and positions as a congressman to anticipate what's next for the Amazon.\n\n\n\nBolsonaro \u2014 who some call \"tropical Trump\" because of some similarities to U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 is a former army captain with a knack for channeling outrage and generating headlines. As a federal congressman for 27 years, he led legislative campaigns to unravel land protections for indigenous people and to promote agribusiness. He also made derogatory comments about minorities, women, and LGBT people.\n\n\n\nMuch of his support comes from business and farming interests.\n\n\n\n\"These farmers are not invaders, they are producers,\" said congressman and senator-elect Luiz Carlos Heinze, a farmer and close ally of Bolsonaro. He blamed past \"leftist administrations\" for promoting indigenous rights at the expense of farmers and ranchers.\n\n\n\n\"Brazil will be the biggest farming nation on Earth during Bolsonaro's years,\" said Heinze.\n\n\n\nIndigenous-rights advocates are worried about the new direction signaled. \"Bolsonaro has repeatedly said that indigenous territories in the Amazon should be opened up for mining and agribusiness, which goes completely in the opposite direction of our Constitution,\" said Adriana Ramos, public policy coordinator at Social Environmental Institute in Brasilia, a non-governmental group.\n\n\n\nIn a Nov. 1 postelection interview with Catholic TV, Bolsonaro said, \"We intend to protect the environment, but without creating difficulties for our progress.\"\n\n\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly said that Brazil should withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, a treaty his predecessor signed in 2016 committing to reduce carbon emissions 37 percent over 2005 levels by 2030. After the election, he has publicly wavered.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile he has named a climate-change denier, Ernesto Araujo, to become the next foreign minister.\n\n\n\nNelson Ananias Filho, sustainability coordinator at Brazil's National Agriculture and Cattle Raising Confederation, which backed Bolsonaro's campaign, said, \"Brazil's agribusiness will adapt to whatever circumstances come.\"\n\n\n\nWhether or not Brazil formally remains in the Paris Climate Accord, the only way for the country to make its emission targets is to completely stop deforestation by 2030 and to reduce agricultural emissions, said Nobre, the climate scientist. \"If Bolsonaro keeps moving in the current direction, that's basically impossible.\"\n\n\n\nThere's another danger lurking in deforestation.\n\n\n\nAside from the oceans, tropical forests are the most important regions on the planet for putting water vapor in the air, which eventually becomes rainfall. \"It's why we have rain in the American Midwest and other inland areas \u2014 it's not just the Amazon, but it's the largest tropical rainforest,\" said Bill Laurance, a tropical ecologist at James Cook University in Cairns, Australia.\n\n\n\nCarlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy, an environmental scientist at George Mason University, have estimated that the \"tipping point for the Amazon system\" is 20 to 25 percent deforestation.\n\n\n\nWithout enough trees to sustain the rainfall, the longer and more pronounced dry season could turn more than half the rainforest into a tropical savannah, they wrote in February in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\n\nIf the rainfall cycle collapses, winter droughts in parts of Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina could devastate agriculture, they wrote. The impacts may even be felt as far away as the American Midwest, said Laurance.\n\n\n\nBolsonaro's rhetoric about potentially dismantling the environmental ministry and rolling back indigenous rights worries Nobre who says, \"I am a scientist, but I am also a Brazilian citizen, and a citizen of the planet.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Google Blocks Gender-Based Pronouns From New AI Tool", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/google-blocks-gender-based-pronouns-from-new-ai-tool/4675819.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Alphabet Inc's Google in May introduced a slick feature for Gmail that automatically completes sentences for users as they type. Tap out \"I love\" and Gmail might propose \"you\" or \"it.\" But users are out of luck if the object of their affection is \"him\" or \"her.\"\n\nGoogle's technology will not suggest gender-based pronouns because the risk is too high that its \"Smart Compose\" technology might predict someone's sex or gender identity incorrectly and offend users, product leaders revealed to Reuters in interviews.\n\nGmail product manager Paul Lambert said a company research scientist discovered the problem in January when he typed \"I am meeting an investor next week,\" and Smart Compose suggested a possible follow-up question: \"Do you want to meet him?\" instead of \"her.\"\n\nConsumers have become accustomed to embarrassing gaffes from autocorrect on smartphones. But Google refused to take chances at a time when gender issues are reshaping politics and society, and critics are scrutinizing potential biases in artificial intelligence like never before.\n\n\"Not all 'screw ups' are equal,\" Lambert said. Gender is a \"a big, big thing\" to get wrong.\n\nGetting Smart Compose right could be good for business. Demonstrating that Google understands the nuances of AI better than competitors is part of the company's strategy to build affinity for its brand and attract customers to its AI-powered cloud computing tools, advertising services and hardware.\n\nGmail has 1.5 billion users, and Lambert said Smart Compose assists on 11 percent of messages worldwide sent from Gmail.com, where the feature first launched.\n\nSmart Compose is an example of what AI developers call natural language generation (NLG), in which computers learn to write sentences by studying patterns and relationships between words in literature, emails and web pages.\n\nA system shown billions of human sentences becomes adept at completing common phrases but is limited by generalities. Men have long dominated fields such as finance and science, for example, so the technology would conclude from the data that an investor or engineer is \"he\" or \"him.\" The issue trips up nearly every major tech company.\n\nLambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said.\n\n\"The only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,\" said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion.\n\nNew policy\n\nGoogle's decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company's predictive technologies.\n\nThe company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine's autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query \"are jews evil\" when users sought information about Jews.\n\nGoogle has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events.\n\nThe company's new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google's Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as \"sounds good.\"\n\nGoogle uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find \"juicy\" gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said.\n\nWorkers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.\n\n\"You need a lot of human oversight,\" said engineering leader Raghavan, because \"in each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.\"\n\nWispread challenge\n\nGoogle is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem. Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents.\n\nIts technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo's chief technology officer.\n\nHe said longer copy is better than missing details. \"The smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,\" AlTantawy said. \"People want 100 percent correct.\"\n\nYet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc propose the gendered \"policeman\" to complete \"police\" and \"salesman\" for \"sales.\"\n\nType the neutral Turkish phrase \"one is a soldier\" into Google Translate and it spits out \"he's a soldier\" in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc opts for \"she\" for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers.\n\nAI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations.\n\nMicrosoft's LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders.\n\nAlibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment. Warnings and limitations like those in Smart Compose remain the most-used countermeasures in complex systems, said John Hegele, integration engineer at Durham, North Carolina-based Automated Insights Inc, which generates news articles from statistics.\n\n\"The end goal is a fully machine-generated system where it magically knows what to write,\" Hegele said. \"There's been a ton of advances made

The strait connects Russia and Crimea.\n\nThere was a dangerous escalation on Sunday in the long-running crisis between Ukraine and Russia, as the Russian coast guard attacked and seized three Ukrainian military ships and their crew. Ukraine\u2019s government declared martial law on Monday in response to the attack, and the incident led to public protests and international condemnations of Russia.\n\nThe naval clash is one of the most significant events in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s hostilities since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, potentially setting up further conflict if tensions aren\u2019t brought under control.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the incident and its fallout:\n\nRussia Seizes Ukrainian Military Ships\n\nRussia and Ukraine have differing versions of events, and each one blames the other for instigating the incident. But at the center of the clash are three Ukrainian military ships that came under attack from Russia\u2019s coast guard while en route to Ukraine\u2019s port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe only way for Ukraine\u2019s ships to sail to Mariupol was by passing through the Kerch Strait, a narrow waterway connecting Russia and Crimea that leads to the Sea of Azov. Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty in 2003 that allows the two countries full access to the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, but Russian coast guard vessels on Sunday moved to stop the Ukrainian ships from passing through the strait. A Russian ship rammed a Ukrainian military tugboat before coast guard vessels opened fire on the two Ukrainian gunships it was accompanying.\n\nA video taken aboard the Ukrainian tugboat captured the start of the attack:\n\nAll three Ukrainian ships were badly damaged and six of their crew were wounded, according to Ukraine\u2019s military, which said Russia then seized the ships and detained 23 Ukrainian crew members. Russia, however, claimed that only three Ukrainians were lightly injured, and accused Ukraine and \u201cits Western patrons\u201d of provoking the attack as \u201cpretext for stepping up sanctions\u201d against the Kremlin. There is also dispute between the two countries over whether Ukraine notified Russia in advance about the ships passing through the strait, with Moscow denying Kiev\u2019s statement that its military alerted the Russian forces multiple times of its intentions.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what will happen to the Ukrainian crew members whom Russia is holding captive. The status of the damaged ships is unknown, and it\u2019s likewise not clear whether Russia will take further action to block access to the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe Dispute Over A Valuable Sea\n\nTensions over both the Kerch Strait and access to the Sea of Azov have been building ever since Russia annexed Crimea, a seizure that gave the Kremlin de facto military control of the strait. About half of Ukraine\u2019s coastline is on the Azov Sea, and many of its shipping routes go through the strait, which means Russia has power over a crucial bottleneck.\n\nIn the past year, the dispute over access to the sea has intensified. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of military buildups and illegal activity in the area, with Kiev alleging that the Russians were preventing ships from passing through the strait. Ukraine also condemned the opening of a multibillion-dollar bridge in May that spans the strait to connect Russia and Crimea. Last month, Ukraine announced it would build a new military base on the Azov Sea to counter the Russian presence.\n\nThe increasingly fraught situation around the sea has unfolded in parallel to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting in recent years between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian military has killed more than 10,000 people. Russia has denied direct involvement in that conflict \u2015 but one of the things that makes Sunday\u2019s incident so notable is that the Kremlin has made no attempt to hide its hostile actions.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Petro Poroshenko addresses the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nMartial Law And What Happens Next\n\nThere are a number of big questions about where the crisis goes from here, and whether the international community can de-escalate the situation. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the incident, while a number of Western nations and NATO officials criticized Russia for aggression and violating international law.\n\nUkraine\u2019s government has declared a 30-day period of martial law, a move that gives authorities sweeping powers to limit freedoms in the country. Ukraine\u2019s parliament approved the measures late on Monday, after President Petro Poroshenko called on lawmakers to support the move. It is the first time Ukraine has imposed martial law since its conflict with Russia began in 2014, and it could have major domestic implications.\n\nSome of Poroshenko\u2019s critics allege that the measures are a political ploy to shore up support for his presidency. His approval ratings have fallen in recent months, and he faces the likelihood of being voted out of office in the country\u2019s presidential elections in March. Declaring martial law could potentially allow Poroshenko to postpone the vote and rally more support through anti-Kremlin appeals.\n\nAfter the naval clash on Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kiev to demonstrate. An embassy car was set aflame. Far-right protesters also gathered outside Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Monday, demanding strong action against Russia and waving nationalist banners."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Meghan McCain Says Paul Manafort Should 'Rot In Hell'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meghan-mccain-paul-manafort-rot-in-hell_us_5bfd7e33e4b0771fb6becebe", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "When it comes to Paul Manafort, Meghan McCain isn\u2019t pulling any punches: She said Tuesday that Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager \u201cshould rot in hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe View\u201d co-host made the heated comments during a discussion about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s allegations that Manafort breached his plea deal by lying during his interviews with prosecutors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, I don\u2019t know anything about this, but what we do know is one of the things that got him in jail was he was an unregistered foreign agent and he was a conduit between Russian oligarchs within Putin\u2019s inner circle,\u201d McCain said.\n\nShe said this connection meant Manafort should be given the harshest possible punishments.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, people who do blood money dealings, he should rot in jail and rot in hell, as far as I\u2019m concerned with Paul Manafort,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCain also said she was worried about the potential consequences if Trump were to pardon Manafort.\n\n\u201cIt would enter us into a new level of insanity in this country, which I don\u2019t think I could stand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on pardons, but I struggle with the idea that any president has so much power they could free someone with getting away with criminal activity.\u201d\n\nMcCain said Manafort should never have been involved in a presidential campaign \u2015 something with which her father, Sen.

The hypocrisy of gay men backing a candidate who has harmed the rights of LGBTQ people and many others was clear as day.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly stunning, however, is that these wealthy white gay men were supporters of Democratic candidates for years. Rich Manahattanites who moved in liberal New York circles, they\u2019d hired Aretha Franklin to sing at their wedding at which David Boies \u2014 Al Gore\u2019s lawyer who led efforts to overturn California\u2019s Proposition 8 \u2014 officiated and Barbara Walters attended.\n\nThe Chelsea townhouse they sold in 2014 for $16 million was the site of a $25,000 per plate fundraiser they held in 2012 for Barack Obama. The two raised millions for Hillary Clinton as well, including for her 2016 race against Trump. Now they\u2019re raising 5 million dollars for Trump this winter.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the spectacle of gay Republicans bowing to GOP politicians over and over again. A minority within a minority (14 percent of lesbian gay or bisexual voters backed Trump in 2016 while 23 percent backed Mitt Romney in 2012, according to exit polls), there have always been gay GOPers who are in complete denial about the harms done by candidates they support.\n\nBy proclaiming their support of Trump & his MAGA followers, Bill White & Bryan Eure also support separating families and gassing babies & children desperate for a better way of life. This well-to-do gay couple also supports rights being stripped from LGBTQ citizens. \u2014 Jim Slattery \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JimSlatteryDC) November 26, 2018\n\nIndeed, the most well known gay GOP group, the Log Cabin Republicans, played a bizarre game during the 2016 election. They often criticized candidate Donald Trump, who was and is opposed to marriage equality, and even refused to endorse him \u2014 despite their president, Gregory T. Angelo, mind-bogglingly claiming that Trump was \u201ca leader on LGBT rights.\u201d After the election, Angelo even claimed Trump is a \u201cpro-LGBT president\u201d \u2014 when Trump, by any measure, has done more damage to LGBTQ rights than any president in history.\n\nThe shocking twist in the profile of White and Eure though, buried far down, is the men\u2019s conversion, which happened on election night, sometime between Trump winning North Carolina and the calling of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, both by razor-thin margins, securing the Electoral College and the presidency:\n\nThe genesis of the couple\u2019s reversal can be timed to about midnight on Nov. 8, 2016. Inside the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, at Ms. Clinton\u2019s election night event, Mr. White stood watching the returns in an increasingly funereal atmosphere. He got in his Chevrolet Suburban and drove to the New York Hilton in Midtown, where Mr. Trump was celebrating his win. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be part of that misery pie; I\u2019m not a wallower in self-pity,\u201d said Mr. White, who now runs Constellations Group, a strategic consultancy firm. \u201cI really believe that once that decision is made, you have to get behind your president.\u201d\n\nThat White and Eure can be so morally vacuous as to simply decide they wanted to go with the winner \u2014 whoever that may be \u2014 and race to the other side of Manhattan to join him at his victory party is almost as jarring as the fact that these men aren\u2019t at all embarrassed to reveal this shallow opportunism to the world.\n\nThere are surely many other crude status seekers of every gender, race and sexual orientation who are as as vile and pathetic as these two, but the fact that they are gay \u2014 and wealthy, white and male \u2014 does deserve some attention.\n\nTrump has attempted to eviscerate the rights and even the existence of transgender people, and has shown himself over and over again to be a misogynist. His racist policies include separating children from their parents at the border and, now, tear-gassing mothers and children. White and Eure, however, are insulated from those policies and actions by their gender, their wealth and their whiteness, despite the fact they are members of a demonized minority without federal civil rights protections.\n\nToo many progressives assume that all queer people connect with other marginalized groups and deeply understand their own minority status. It\u2019s similar to the surprise many progressives had at the fact that many white women still voted for Republicans in the midterms, despite everything Trump and his party have done to harm and insult women.\n\nWhite women, however, can be just as conservative \u2014 and just as racist \u2014 as white men. (Interestingly, among white women, class and education were a factor in the midterms, but they broke the other way: Less educated, white working-class women voted Republican, while, in many places, more educated, suburban white women fled the GOP.) Gay men can be just as racist and sexist as straight men. And having a lot of money can help blunt the effects of authoritarianism.\n\nIf White and Eure should be excoriated for selling out their own people \u2014 and they should \u2014 the New York Times should be slapped, once again, for offering itself up as a public relations tool for Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s Supreme Court picks threaten gay marriage, and his Justice Department lent support to allowing employers to fire or turn away workers simply for being gay, lesbian or bisexual. But White and Eure are protected by their wealth from the administration\u2019s brutality against LGBT people. Eure says, in defense of his support of Trump, that he doesn\u2019t like \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Yet it\u2019s his identity that gives him the luxury to say so \u2014 just as many straight white men do.\n\nWhite and Eure\u2019s status-seeking is also tied to homophobia and reeks of self-loathing. White expresses contempt for Chelsea Clinton because he had to \u201ccall through five people\u201d to reach her on the phone when he was a Clinton supporter, while, as a Trump supporter, Donald Trump Jr. \u201cpicks up on the first ring\u201d when he calls. The men express anger about attending the Democratic National Convention in 2016 in Philadelphia \u2014 even chartering a helicopter to get there \u2014 but being unable to get access to Hillary Clinton for a greeting. Trump, on the other hand, has welcomed them at Mar-a-Lago and poses with them in photos they can use on their Twitter backgrounds.\n\nAgain, craven status-seeking comes in all shapes and sizes. But I\u2019ve seen it enough among gay men to know these superficial acts of recognition by powerful people often offer men like this a sugar high because they know, deep down, they\u2019re members of a despised minority even though they\u2019ve made it into (or were born into) an elite echelon in society. Through these empty gestures, they tell themselves and others that they\u2019re not like the rest of them. And con artists like the Trump family know people like this are easy marks.\n\nIf White and Eure should be excoriated for selling out their own people \u2014 and they should be \u2014 The New York Times should be slapped, once again, for offering itself up as a public relations tool for Trump.\n\nThis is the paper that, during the 2016 campaign, wrongly and recklessly told us Trump had \u201cmore accepting views on gay issues\u201d than other Republicans while providing skimpy evidence \u2014 and that never apologized for this dubious, harmful reporting. Now here it is seeming to try to validate that by showing us two wealthy, privileged gay men who agree.\n\nThere\u2019s little context offered in the piece about what Trump has done to the LGBTQ community, or even a mention of Trump\u2019s horrendous ban on transgender people serving in the military \u2014 a court challenge that he\u2019s trying to rush to the Supreme Court \u2014 nor are these men asked about it.\n\nThe story is similar the one the Times offered up in 2017 about Neil Gorsuch\u2019s \u201cgay friends\u201d who vouched for him just as his anti-gay record was being questioned ahead of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. (And Gorsuch turned out to be as hostile to marriage equality as many had warned.)\n\nIt\u2019s also similar to the story in which gay backers of Betsy DeVos emerged to tell the Times that the education secretary nominee, who was in peril of not being confirmed by the Senate, was actually pro-gay, contrary to earlier reports. (She, too, turned out to be as bad as LGBTQ advocates said she would be.)\n\nWhite and Eure made their conversion to Trump from Clinton over two years ago, driving across town and never looking back. But it\u2019s only now, after Trump suffered a blow in the midterms, that they\u2019ve surfaced in the media. An all-new crop of \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans \u2014 those who jumped ship from Trump \u2014 have actually become a decisive force, turning out in the midterms to vote Democratic, including many GOP women.\n\nAnd yet, all of a sudden two gay men who went the other way have popped up in a high-profile piece in the New York Times, just as Trump is revving up what looks to be a difficult re-election campaign."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Rule No. 1 In Warfare: Know Your Enemy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rule-number-one-in-warfare-know-your-enemy_us_5bfd6b31e4b0589e5006f155", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\n\nWhat does President Trump\u2019s recent nomination of retired Army General John Abizaid to become the next U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia signify? Next to nothing \u2015 and arguably quite a lot.\n\nAbizaid\u2019s proposed appointment is both a non-event and an opportunity not to be wasted. It means next to nothing in this sense: while once upon a time, American diplomats abroad wielded real clout \u2015 Benjamin Franklin and John Quincy Adams offer prominent examples \u2015 that time is long past. Should he receive Senate confirmation, Ambassador Abizaid will not actually shape U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia. At most, he will convey policy, while keeping officials back in Washington apprised regarding conditions in the Kingdom. \u201cConditions\u201d in this context will mean the opinions, attitudes, whims, and mood of one particular individual: Mohammed bin Salman. MBS, as he is known, is the Saudi crown prince and the Kingdom\u2019s de facto absolute ruler. By no means incidentally, he is also that country\u2019s assassin-in-chief as well as the perpetrator of atrocities in a vicious war that he launched in neighboring Yemen in 2015.\n\nImplicit in Abizaid\u2019s job description will be a requirement to cozy up to MBS. \u201cCozy up\u201d in this context implies finding ways to befriend, influence, and seduce; that is, seeking to replicate in Riyadh the achievements in Washington of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who from 1983 to 2005 served as Saudi ambassador to the United States.\n\nWith plenty of money to spread around, Bandar charmed \u2015 which in this context means suborned \u2015 the Washington establishment, while ingratiating himself with successive presidents and various other power brokers. With his fondness for nicknames, George W. Bush dubbed him \u201cBandar Bush,\u201d informally designating the Saudi prince a member of his own dynastic clan.\n\nAfter 9/11, the Saudi envoy made the most of those connections, deflecting attention away from the role Saudis had played in the events of that day while fingering Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq as the true font of Islamist terrorism. Bush came around to endorsing Bandar\u2019s view \u2015 although he may not have needed much urging. So while Bandar may not rank alongside the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz among the architects of the ensuing Iraq War, he certainly deserves honorable mention.\n\nThat Abizaid will come anywhere close to replicating Bandar\u2019s notable (or nefarious) achievements seems unlikely. For starters, at age 67, he may not want to spend the next 20 years or so in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, sucking up to the Kingdom\u2019s royals. At least as significantly, he lacks Bandar\u2019s bankroll. However much dough Abizaid may have raked in via his consulting firm since leaving the Army a decade ago, it doesn\u2019t qualify as real money in Saudi circles, where a billion dollars is a mere rounding error. The mega-rich do not sell themselves cheaply, unless perhaps your surname is Trump.\n\nSo the substantive implications of Abizaid\u2019s appointment for U.S.-Saudi relations will likely be negligible. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner will undoubtedly continue to wield greater influence over MBS than Ambassador Abizaid \u2015 or at least will fancy that he is doing so.\n\nLong (and Wrong) War\n\nIn another sense, however, Abizaid\u2019s appointment to this post (vacant since Donald Trump became president) could mean quite a lot. It offers an ideal opportunity to take stock of the \u201cLong War.\u201d\n\nNow that phrase \u201cLong War\u201d is one that presidents, national security advisors, defense secretaries, and their minions assiduously avoid. Yet, in military circles, it long ago superseded the Global War on Terrorism as an umbrella term describing what U.S. forces have been doing across the Greater Middle East all these many years.\n\nAlready by 2005, for example, hawkish analysts employed by a conservative Washington think tank were marketing their recipe for Winning the Long War. And that was just for starters. For more than a decade now, the Long War Journal has been offering authoritative analysis of U.S. military operations across the Greater Middle East and Africa. In the meantime, West Point\u2019s Combating Terrorism Center churns out monographs with titles like Fighting the Long War. Always quick to recognize another golden goose of government contracts, the RAND Corporation weighed in with Unfolding the Future of the Long War. After publishing a lengthy essay in the New York Times Magazine called \u201cMy Long War,\u201d correspondent Dexter Filkins went a step further and titled his book The Forever War. (And for creative types, Voices from the Long War invites Iraq and Afghan War vets to reflect on their experiences before a theatrical audience.)\n\nBut where, you might wonder, did that dour phrase originate? As it happens, General Abizaid himself coined it back in 2004 when he was still an active duty four-star and head of U.S. Central Command, the regional headquarters principally charged with waging that conflict. In other words, just a year after the U.S. invaded Iraq and President George W. Bush posed under a White House-produced \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner, with administration officials and their neoconservative boosters looking forward to many more \u201cIraqi Freedom\u201d-style victories to come, the senior officer presiding over that war went on record to indicate that victory wasn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon. Oops.\n\nAnd so it has come to pass. The Long War has now lasted twice as long as the average length of marriages in the United States, with no end in sight. Whether intuitively or after careful study, General Abizaid had divined something important indeed.\n\nCrucially, however, his critique went beyond the question of duration. Abizaid also departed from the administration\u2019s line in describing the actual nature of the problem at hand. \u201cTerrorists\u201d per se were not the enemy, he insisted at the time. The issue was much bigger than any one organization such as al-Qaeda. The real threat facing the United States came from what he called \u201cSalafist jihadists,\u201d radicalized Sunni Muslims committed by whatever means necessary to propagating a strict and puritanical form of Islam around the world. To promote their cause, Salafists eagerly embraced violence.\n\nBack in 2004, when Abizaid was venturing heretical thoughts, the United States had gotten itself all tangled up in a nasty scuffle in Iraq. A year earlier, the U.S. had invaded that country to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Now the Iraqi dictator was indubitably a bad actor. At least some of the charges that George W. Bush and his subordinates, amplified by a neoconservative chorus, lodged against him were true. Yet Saddam was the inverse of a Salafist.\n\nIndeed, even before plunging into Iraq, looking beyond an expected easy win over Saddam, George W. Bush had identified Iran as a key member of an \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d and implicitly next in line for liberation. Sixteen years later, members of the Trump administration still hanker to have it out with the ayatollahs governing Shiite-majority Iran. Yet, as was the case with Saddam, those ayatollahs are anything but Salafists.\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting that Abizaid was not some dime-a-dozen four-star. He speaks Arabic, won a fellowship to study in Jordan, and earned a graduate degree in Middle East Studies at Harvard. If the post-9/11 American officer corps had in its ranks an equivalent of Lawrence of Arabia, he was it, even if without T.E. Lawrence\u2019s (or Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s) charisma and flair for self-promotion. Nonetheless, with Abizaid suggesting, in effect, that the Iraq War was \u201cthe wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time against the wrong enemy,\u201d just about no one in Washington was willing to listen.\n\nThat once-familiar quotation dates from 1951, when General Omar Bradley warned against extending the then-ongoing Korean War into China. Bradley\u2019s counsel carried considerable weight \u2015 and limiting the scope of the Korean War made it possible to end that conflict in 1953.\n\nAbizaid\u2019s counsel turned out to carry next to no weight at all. So the Long War just keeps getting longer, even as its strategic rationale becomes ever more difficult to discern.\n\nThe Real Enemy\n\nPosit, for the sake of discussion, that back in 2004 Abizaid was onto something \u2015 as indeed he was. Who then, in this Long War of ours, is our adversary? Who is in league with those Salafi jihadists? Who underwrites their cause?\n\nThe answer to those questions is not exactly a mystery. It\u2019s the Saudi royal family. Were it not for Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in promoting militant Salafism over the course of several decades, it would pose no bigger problem than Cliven Bundy\u2019s bickering with the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nTo put it another way, while the Long War has found U.S. troops fighting the wrong enemy for years on end in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, the nexus of the problem remains Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have provided billions to fund madrassas and mosques, spreading Salafism to the far reaches of the Islamic world. Next to oil, violent jihadism is Saudi Arabia\u2019s principal export. Indeed, the former funds the latter.\n\nThose Saudi efforts have borne fruit of a poisonous character. Recall that Osama bin Laden was a Saudi. So, too, were 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001. These facts are not incidental, even if \u2015 to expand on Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s famous typology of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns \u2015 Washington treats them as knowns we prefer to pretend we don\u2019t know.\n\nSo from the outset, in the conflict that the United States dates from September 2001, our ostensible ally has been the principal source of the problem. In the Long War, Saudi Arabia represents what military theorists like to call the center of gravity, defined as \u201cthe source of power that provides moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act\u201d to the enemy. When it comes to Salafist jihadism, Saudi Arabia fits that definition to a T.\n\nSo there is more than a little poetic justice \u2015 or is it irony? \u2015 in General Abizaid\u2019s proposed posting to Riyadh. The one senior military officer who early on demonstrated an inkling of understanding of the Long War\u2019s true nature now prepares to take up an assignment in what is, in essence, the very center of the enemy\u2019s camp. It\u2019s as if President Lincoln had dispatched Ulysses S. Grant to Richmond, Virginia, in 1864 as his liaison to Jefferson Davis.\n\nWhich brings us to the opportunity referred to at the outset of this essay. The opportunity is not Abizaid\u2019s. He can look forward to a frustrating and probably pointless assignment. Yet Trump\u2019s nomination of Abizaid presents an opportunity to the U.S. senators charged with approving his appointment. While we can take it for granted that Abizaid will be confirmed, the process of confirmation offers the Senate, and especially members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a chance to take stock of this Long War of ours and, in particular, to assess how Saudi Arabia fits into the struggle.\n\nWho better to reflect on these matters than John Abizaid? Imagine the questions:\n\nGeneral, can you describe this Long War of ours? What is its nature? What is it all about?\n\nAre we winning? How can we tell?\n\nHow much longer should Americans expect it to last?\n\nWhat are we up against? Give us a sense of the enemy\u2019s intentions, capabilities, and prospects.\n\nWith MBS in charge, is Saudi Arabia part of the solution or part of the problem?\n\nTake all the time you need, sir. Be candid. We\u2019re interested in your opinion.\n\nAfter the embarrassment of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, the Senate is badly in need of refurbishing its reputation. The Abizaid nomination provides a ready-made chance to do just that. Let\u2019s see if the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body\u201d rises to the occasion. Just don\u2019t hold your breath."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Casey Anthony's Dad Seriously Injured In Florida Car Accident", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/casey-anthony-dad-florida-car-accident_us_5bfd69bfe4b0771fb6be8b01", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "George Anthony was badly injured when his vehicle overturned on a Florida interstate, police confirmed.\n\nThe crash occurred on Saturday at about 3:00 p.m. local time along I-4 westbound in Daytona Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 911 caller told police that the vehicle the 67-year-old Anthony was operating \u2014 a 1999 Toyota 4-Runner \u2014 veered off the right shoulder near the SR-44 exit.\n\n\u201cIt went from the right side into the grass, and then it literally came across the three lanes back into the median, over to the grass as it flipped,\u201d the caller said.\n\nAnthony suffered \u201cincapacitating injuries\u201d in the crash, police said.

The final Senate seat up for grabs in this year\u2019s midterm elections, the contest has drawn increased national attention due to a series of offensive comments from Hyde-Smith that hark back to the state\u2019s racist history. If elected, Espy would become the state\u2019s first black senator since Reconstruction.\n\nThe closer-than-expected race in a GOP stronghold has drawn comparisons to the Senate special election in Alabama last year, when Democrat Doug Jones pulled off a surprise victory against Republican Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexually assaulting or harassing nearly 10 girls and young women.\n\nHere\u2019s what else to know about Mississippi\u2019s runoff election, whose winner will fill the seat vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Thad Cochran and held briefly through appointment by Hyde-Smith.\n\nJonathan Bachman / Reuters GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy face off in Tuesday's Mississippi Senate runoff.\n\nWhy is there a runoff?\n\nHyde-Smith, appointed to Cochran\u2019s seat when he retired earlier this year, and Espy, a former congressman and agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton, were the top two finishers in the Nov. 6 special election.\n\nBut neither got enough votes to achieve an outright victory, sending the race to a runoff. Hyde-Smith, who would become the state\u2019s first elected female senator, got 41.5 percent of the vote, and Espy got 40.6 percent.\n\nWhat did Hyde-Smith say?\n\nHyde-Smith is under fire for two comments she made at campaign stops earlier this month that evoked the South\u2019s racist history. Referring to a local rancher, she joked that, \u201cif he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d\n\nThe comments were a reminder of the public lynchings of African-Americans during the Jim Crow era. According to the NAACP, Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings of any state from 1882 to 1968.\n\nIn another incident, the senator suggested to a group of young voters that voter suppression would be \u201ca great idea,\u201d which again carries particular weight in Mississippi, a state that has long disenfranchised black voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nHow have people responded to her remarks?\n\nEspy said Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks on attending \u201ca public hanging\u201d were \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cshow that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state.\u201d\n\nBelow is the Espy for Senate Campaign statement on Cindy Hyde-Smith's \"public hanging\" comments: pic.twitter.com/zccgQelDWt \u2014 Mike Espy (@espyforsenate) November 11, 2018\n\nIn response to the voter suppression comments, his campaign spokesman said: \u201cFor a state like Mississippi, where voting rights were obtained through sweat and blood, everyone should appreciate that this is not a laughing matter. Mississippians deserve a senator who represents our best qualities, not a walking stereotype who embarrasses our state.\u201d\n\nA number of civil rights organizations have condemned Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks, pointing to the state\u2019s history of racism.\n\nSeveral corporate donors, including retail giant Walmart, announced that they would pull their donations from Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign.\n\nDid Hyde-Smith apologize?\n\nShe and her campaign initially claimed both comments were just jokes.\n\nDuring the only debate between the two candidates last week, Hyde-Smith apologized to \u201canyone that was offended by my comments.\u201d But she insisted that \u201cthis comment was twisted, and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me.\u201d\n\nEspy called her out.\n\n\u201cNo one twisted your comments. They came out of your mouth. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth,\u201d he said. He added that Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks have \u201cgiven our state another black eye that we don\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nSeveral other racist incidents involving Hyde-Smith have emerged in the last week.\n\nIn 2014, the senator promoted a picture of herself wearing a Confederate hat, calling it \u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d\n\nThe Jackson Free-Press reported over the weekend that Hyde-Smith attended one of Mississippi\u2019s so-called segregation academies \u2015 private schools established for white parents who didn\u2019t want their children to attend school with black children long after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Brown v. Board decision ordering the desegregation of public schools. Hyde-Smith sent her daughter to a similar school.\n\nWhat other issues have come up in the campaign?\n\nHyde-Smith and Republicans have taken aim at Espy by focusing on his previous work as a lobbyist and accusations of corruption. Hyde-Smith released an ad suggesting that Espy lied about his lobbying work for an Ivory Coast despot now facing charges of war crimes, according to The Washington Post.\n\nEspy\u2019s connection to Clinton has also become a line of attack, as well as corruption claims that forced him to resign as Clinton\u2019s agriculture secretary in 1994. Espy was later acquitted of the charges, which included taking improper gifts.\n\nTrying to counter Hyde-Smith\u2019s labeling of him as \u201ca liberal Democrat,\u201d Espy has portrayed himself as someone who can reach across the political aisle, highlighting his endorsement of the state\u2019s former governor, Republican Haley Barbour, and talking about how he will work with the GOP on issues like health care.\n\nWho are some big names that have gotten involved?\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has endorsed Hyde-Smith, campaigned with her on Monday.

In the U.S., Congress banned the use of federal money for experiments in gene editing on human embryos, and the FDA is banned from approving clinical trials that involve the same.\n\nNita Farahany, a bioethicist and director of the Duke Initiative for Science & Society, says that she isn\u2019t surprised to learn that a scientist has flouted global conventions to move forward with the gene editing of healthy embryos to create pregnancies and births.\n\nHowever, she, like Volberding, is surprised that HIV is the first application for germline gene editing, given the therapies already available to suppress virus levels and help people live long, healthy lives.\n\n\u201cYou would think the earliest application of CRISPR-cas9 for gene editing would be more fatal genetic variations,\u201d Farahany said, referring to the tool that allows scientists to cut out sections of a genome and replace them with something else. \u201cThings that cause great physical suffering or death in children,\u201d like infantile Tay-Sachs, a severe disease that can cause an infant to eventually lose their sight, hearing, and ability to move before causing their death around ages 4 or 5 years old.\n\nIn addition to the medical redundancy of He\u2019s experiment, experts also fear that his results might in fact perpetuate stigma against people with HIV, in a country where people already face severe consequences if others discover their HIV status.\n\nAnn Mongoven, associate director of Healthcare Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, notes that the AP story that broke the news raises troubling questions about whether or not scientists leveraged HIV stigma to manipulate the parents into participating in the research.\n\nThe AP reports that of the seven couples who consented to do the experimental in vitro fertilization with He, all of the men had HIV, but they all had suppressed their levels of the virus with standard HIV medication. This suppression, combined with basic infection control measures like condom use throughout the pregnancy, would have prevented them from transmitting the virus to their partners and unborn children.\n\nStill, the article says that they wanted to participate in what He called an \u201cAIDS vaccine development\u201d program to protect their future children from \u201ca similar fate.\u201d It is not a given that a child with an HIV-positive parent will one day contract the virus themselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real question if whether the fear of AIDS and AIDS stigma became a way of recruiting parents into this research,\u201d she said.\n\nMongoven is worried that once news of the twins spreads, it could feed misperception about how HIV is passed on in the first place. There are about a half-million people living with HIV in China.\n\nNot The \u2018Best First Case\u2019\n\nBioethicist Arthur Caplan of New York University School of Medicine says that genetic engineering of human beings is inevitable, and that while there are fears that parents will create \u201cdesigner babies\u201d by prioritizing surface-level traits like eye color and height, scientists are primarily interested in the technology for disease prevention and treatment \u2015 much like He\u2019s experiment.\n\nEventually, he predicts, once gene editing becomes a reliable tool to help prevent disease and other undesirable traits, parents might actually be considered negligent if they chose not to use these tools.\n\n\u201cThere are many cultures in the world, including the U.S., that are highly competitive, market-driven societies where individuals are looking for their children in particular to get an edge and advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re not going to do gene editing when it gets close to enhancement or improvement, I find it silly and head-in-the-sand kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a recent Pew Survey of about 2,500 Americans finds that 72 percent think gene editing to treat a serious birth defect or disease is an appropriate use of the technology, while 60 percent say it\u2019s also appropriate to use the technology to reduce the risk of a serious disease that could appear over the course of a lifetime.\n\nBut until gene editing become safe and standardized, experts are clear about where the boundaries are. The experts we spoke to are profoundly disappointed that He\u2019s experiment was the first to demonstrate CRISPR-cas9\u2019s potential to the world.\n\nVolberding is excited about the promise that genetic editing holds for HIV \u2015 but only to cure people who already have the infection, not prevent it in healthy people. Farhany, too, thinks genetic editing holds great promise to alleviate human suffering \u2015 but only after a substantial body of animal and plant studies have proven it safe and effective."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "CDC Confirms 116 Cases Of Polio-Like AFM Illness In 31 States", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/acute-flaccid-myelitis-cases-rise_us_5bfd4990e4b0eb6d9313cc04", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "A mysterious polio-like illness that is sickening and in some cases paralyzing children is on the rise with at least 116 confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis so far this year, federal health officials said.\n\nThe latest number of confirmed AFM cases, spread across 31 states, is slightly more than double the number reported in October by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released its latest findings on Monday.\n\nAn additional 170 possible cases remain unconfirmed and under investigation, the CDC said.\n\nAFM is an extremely rare but serious neurological condition that causes the body\u2019s muscles and reflexes to become weak.

Just check the label.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration narrowed its blanket warning from last week, when it said people shouldn\u2019t eat any romaine because of an E. coli outbreak. The agency said Monday the romaine linked to the outbreak appears to be from the California\u2019s Central Coast region. It said romaine from elsewhere should soon be labeled with harvest dates and regions, so people know it\u2019s OK to eat.\n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t eat romaine that doesn\u2019t have the label information, the FDA said. For romaine that doesn\u2019t come in packaging, grocers and retailers are being asked to post the information by the register.\n\nRomaine harvesting recently began shifting from California\u2019s Central Coast to winter growing areas, primarily Arizona, Florida, Mexico and California\u2019s Imperial Valley. Those winter regions weren\u2019t yet shipping when the illnesses began. The FDA also noted hydroponically grown romaine and romaine grown in greenhouses aren\u2019t implicated in the outbreak.\n\nThe labeling arrangement was worked out as the produce industry called on the FDA to quickly narrow the scope of its warning so it wouldn\u2019t have to waste freshly harvested romaine. An industry group said people can expect to start seeing labels as early as this week. It noted the labels are voluntary, and that it will monitor whether to expand the measure to other leafy greens and produce.\n\nThe FDA said the industry committed to making the labeling standard for romaine and to consider longer-term labeling options for other leafy greens.\n\nRobert Whitaker, chief science officer of the Produce Marketing Association, said labeling for romaine could help limit the scope of future alerts and rebuild public trust after other outbreaks.\n\n\u201cRomaine as a category has had a year that\u2019s been unfortunate,\u201d Whitaker said.\n\nThe FDA still hasn\u2019t identified a source of contamination in the latest outbreak. There have been no reported deaths, but health officials say 43 people in 12 states have been sickened. Twenty-two people in Canada were also sickened.\n\nEven though romaine from the Yuma, Arizona, region is not implicated in the current outbreak, it was blamed for an E. coli outbreak this spring that sickened more than 200 people and killed five. Contaminated irrigation water near a cattle lot was later identified as the likely source.\n\nLeafy greens were also blamed for an E. coli outbreak last year. U.S. investigators never specified which salad green might be to blame for those illnesses, which happened around the same time of year as the current outbreak. But officials in Canada identified romaine as a common source of illnesses there.\n\nThe produce industry is aware the problem is recurring, said Jennifer McEntire of the United Fresh Produce Association.\n\n\u201cTo have something repeat in this way, there simply must be some environmental source that persisted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question now is, can we find it?\u201d\n\nGrowers and handlers in the region tightened food safety measures after the outbreak this spring, the industry says. Steps include expanding buffer zones between cattle lots and produce fields. But McEntire said it\u2019s not known for sure how the romaine became contaminated in the Yuma outbreak. Another possibility, she said, is that winds blew dust from the cattle lot onto produce.\n\nMcEntire said the industry is considering multiple theories, including whether there is something about romaine that makes it more susceptible to contamination. Compared with iceberg lettuce, she noted its leaves are more open, thus exposing more surface area.\n\nSince romaine has a shelf life of about 21 days, health officials said last week they believed contaminated romaine could still be on the market or in people\u2019s homes.\n\nFood poisoning outbreaks from leafy greens are not unusual. But after a 2006 outbreak linked to spinach, the produce industry took steps it believed would limit large scale outbreaks, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor. The outbreak linked to romaine earlier this year cast doubt on how effective the measures have been, he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amanda Bynes Opens Up About Drug-Fueled Downfall In New Interview", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amanda-bynes-paper-magazine_us_5bfc6d10e4b0771fb6bd14ac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "After shying away from the public eye for a few years, Amanda Bynes opened up about her past \u2015 and her present \u2015 in the annual \u201cBreak the Internet\u201d issue of Paper Magazine.\n\nThe former child star spoke about her struggles with drug use and added that she didn\u2019t start partying until she was 25 \u2015 and never really drank alcohol.\n\n\u201cI started smoking marijuana when I was 16,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get addicted [then] and I wasn\u2019t abusing it.

The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that\u2019s causing problems.\n\nAll of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.\n\nInstead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.\n\nHe recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym \u201cBai Hua,\u201d told the AP that it\u2019s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.\n\nHere is how He described the work:\n\nThe gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was \u201cwashed\u201d to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.\n\nWhen the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.\n\nTests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.\n\nSeveral scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.\n\nThey also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like not editing at all\u201d if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.\n\nChurch and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.\n\n\u201cIn that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you\u2019re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,\u201d Musunuru said.\n\nThe use of that embryo suggests that the researchers\u2019 \u201cmain emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,\u201d Church said.\n\nEven if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it\u2019s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.\n\nThere also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it \u2014 on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an \u201cAIDS vaccine development\u201d program.\n\nThe Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d thinks they were able to understand the risks.\n\nDeem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.\n\n\u201cThat might be a layman\u2019s way of describing it,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.\n\nThe Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they\u2019re adults.\n\nFurther pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a \u201cfirst\u201d was achieved, He acknowledged.

Flynn, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, who reported to prison on Monday to serve his 14-day sentence. A Dutch lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, who had business dealings with Mr. Manafort, also pleaded guilty to lying to the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\nMost recently, Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and friend of the former Trump campaign aide Roger J. Stone Jr., said Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is pressuring him to plead guilty to lying to them about his communications with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks.

He won few points by calling Mr. Trump \u201cDonald\u201d in his first CNN appearance, as if he were Mr. Trump\u2019s peer. Some aides suggested he was unfamiliar with all the changes in politics \u2014 most notably the rise of the internet \u2014 since 1996, when he last worked on an American presidential campaign. Others described him as lazy, carefully noting when he took off on Fridays for the Hamptons. Mr. Manafort said he had built a television studio at his home there so he could appear on Sunday talk shows remotely.\n\nHe lasted only five months, three of them as campaign chairman. When The New York Times revealed that a ledger found by Ukrainian investigators had listed $12.7 million in off-the-books cash payments to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm, one former campaign aide said that Mr. Trump was enraged. But another article detailing how Mr. Manafort and others were begging Mr. Trump to stop picking public fights equally angered Mr. Trump. When Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told Mr. Manafort he was out, Mr. Trump was barely speaking to him.\n\nBy then, Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial house of cards was on the verge of collapse. Less than two weeks after he left the campaign, one lender informed him that it had started to foreclose on his Brooklyn brownstone. He had paid cash for it when he was financially flush four years earlier, then borrowed $5.3 million against it that February. Five months had passed with no payments.\n\nMr. Gates managed to retain his affiliation to Mr. Trump as a liaison between the campaign and the Republican National Committee, although Mr. Trump disliked him so much that he was barred from flying on the candidate\u2019s private plane. Mr. Manafort tried to use his lingering connection to Mr. Trump to land consulting work and to persuade banks to bail him out. He dangled a possible cabinet secretary post in front of Stephen Calk, chairman of Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, pressing Mr. Gates to promote him as a possible secretary of the Army.\n\nHe continued to treat Mr. Gates as his aide, asking him how to convert profit-and-loss statements from PDF format into Word in order, prosecutors said, to inflate his income and appear more creditworthy to banks. After the election, Mr. Calk approved two loans to Mr. Manafort for a total of $16 million. Mr. Manafort used some of it to save his Brooklyn property from foreclosure.\n\nBut even Mr. Calk was getting worried. On Dec. 7, 2016, he wrote to another top bank official: \u201cNervousness is setting in.\u201d Less than a year later, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team filed the first of a series of indictments against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Mueller granted a plea deal to Mr. Gates and immunity from prosecution to five of the nearly dozen witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Manafort celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary in jail. He was allowed three visits limited to 30 minutes each.

He won few points by calling Mr. Trump \u201cDonald\u201d in his first CNN appearance, as if he were Mr. Trump\u2019s peer. Some aides suggested he was unfamiliar with all the changes in politics \u2014 most notably the rise of the internet \u2014 since 1996, when he last worked on an American presidential campaign. Others described him as lazy, carefully noting when he took off on Fridays for the Hamptons. Mr. Manafort said he had built a television studio at his home there so he could appear on Sunday talk shows remotely.\n\nHe lasted only five months, three of them as campaign chairman. When The New York Times revealed that a ledger found by Ukrainian investigators had listed $12.7 million in off-the-books cash payments to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm, one former campaign aide said that Mr. Trump was enraged. But another article detailing how Mr. Manafort and others were begging Mr. Trump to stop picking public fights equally angered Mr. Trump. When Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told Mr. Manafort he was out, Mr. Trump was barely speaking to him.\n\nBy then, Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial house of cards was on the verge of collapse. Less than two weeks after he left the campaign, one lender informed him that it had started to foreclose on his Brooklyn brownstone. He had paid cash for it when he was financially flush four years earlier, then borrowed $5.3 million against it that February. Five months had passed with no payments.\n\nMr. Gates managed to retain his affiliation to Mr. Trump as a liaison between the campaign and the Republican National Committee, although Mr. Trump disliked him so much that he was barred from flying on the candidate\u2019s private plane. Mr. Manafort tried to use his lingering connection to Mr. Trump to land consulting work and to persuade banks to bail him out. He dangled a possible cabinet secretary post in front of Stephen Calk, chairman of Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, pressing Mr. Gates to promote him as a possible secretary of the Army.\n\nHe continued to treat Mr. Gates as his aide, asking him how to convert profit-and-loss statements from PDF format into Word in order, prosecutors said, to inflate his income and appear more creditworthy to banks. After the election, Mr. Calk approved two loans to Mr. Manafort for a total of $16 million. Mr. Manafort used some of it to save his Brooklyn property from foreclosure.\n\nBut even Mr. Calk was getting worried. On Dec. 7, 2016, he wrote to another top bank official: \u201cNervousness is setting in.\u201d Less than a year later, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team filed the first of a series of indictments against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Mueller granted a plea deal to Mr. Gates and immunity from prosecution to five of the nearly dozen witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Manafort celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary in jail. He was allowed three visits limited to 30 minutes each.

The preliminary test will be when Democrats meet on Wednesday to cast secret ballots for their leaders.\n\nBut the ultimate verdict will not come until January, when the new Congress must elect a speaker on the House floor.

It instead supports allowing bipartisan measures to have a chance of being debated and voted upon.\n\nAmong the group\u2019s proposals is mandating that any bill receiving 290 co-sponsors would go to the House floor for debate and a timely vote, an idea that a senior Democratic aide said Ms. Pelosi had already agreed to include in proposed rules she will present when the new Congress convenes in January. Another would guarantee that any amendment that has at least 20 Democratic and 20 Republican co-sponsors would get a debate and a vote. The third request, aimed at empowering rank-and-file lawmakers, is that each member be allowed to introduce one bill, co-sponsored by a member of the other party, to be debated and considered on a committee on which he or she serves.\n\nThe effort has infuriated newly empowered liberals, who have accused the Problem Solvers Caucus of being \u201ccorporatist\u201d Democrats beholden to the same political donors that Republicans rely on. They question why Democrats are always the ones to cede power when they attain it.\n\nThe nine Democrats are in addition to the group that signed the letter last week vowing not to support Ms. Pelosi, a coalition initially numbering 17 that has shrunk since its leaders first sought to form it. There are also at least four newly elected Democrats who did not sign the letter, but have said they will keep their campaign pledge not to back Ms. Pelosi.

The county had 548 overdose deaths by Nov. 30 last year; so far this year there have been 250, a 54 percent decline.\n\nDayton, a hollowed-out manufacturing center at the juncture of two major interstates, had one of the highest opioid overdose death rates in the nation in 2017 and the worst in Ohio. Now, it may be at the leading edge of a waning phase of an epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States over the last decade, including nearly 50,000 last year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The New Old Age: Social Security Runs Short of Money, and Ideas Fly on How to Repair It", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/social-security.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:02:05", "body_paragraphs": "We\u2019ve long heard warnings that the Social Security program that 52 million Americans rely on for their retirement benefits could one day run out of money.\n\nAnalysts say that\u2019s not going to happen \u2014 if only because older people are such a powerful voting force \u2014 but this year the system has hit a worrisome milestone: the Social Security Administration reported that the retirement benefits paid out each month exceeded the tax revenues and interest that fund the program.\n\nThat necessitated the first dip into the Social Security Trust Fund in 35 years.

Driving around L.A. is scary even for very experienced adult drivers. Does a 16-year-old boy, whose navigation skills are limited to the internet, have the judgment, attention span and ability to process a dozen different inputs simultaneously necessary to avoid an accident?\n\nMind you, learning to drive was not my grandson\u2019s idea, but his parents are tired of chauffeuring the kids everywhere, and options to walk, cycle or take public transportation, which suited my 18-year-old grandsons in New York City just fine, are lacking where they live.\n\nIf I could make the rules, no one under 20 would be behind the wheel of a motor vehicle without an experienced licensed adult in the passenger seat. Even compared to 18-year-olds, the brain of a 20-year-old is more mature and less likely to succumb to risk-taking. Crash investigations have shown that \u201cthe cause of teenage crashes is not the skill with which they can drive, but the judgment they exercise while driving,\u201d according to an editorial in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\nAlthough the number of teenagers killed in motor vehicle crashes has dropped by almost 50 percent in the last decade, crashes remain the leading cause of adolescent death and injury in the United States. And since 2014, along with the use of electronic devices, teenage motor vehicle fatalities have risen, according to a new policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Federal Ban on Female Genital Mutilation Ruled Unconstitutional by Judge", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/health/fgm-female-genital-mutilation-law.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-27 19:02:06", "body_paragraphs": "More than two decades ago, Congress adopted a sweeping law that outlawed female genital mutilation, an ancient practice that 200 million women and girls around the world have undergone. But a federal court considering the first legal challenge to the statute found the law unconstitutional on Tuesday, greatly diminishing the chances of it being used by federal prosecutors around the country.\n\nA federal judge in Michigan issued the ruling in a case that involved two doctors and four parents, among others, who had been criminally charged last year with participating in or enabling the ritual genital cutting of girls. Their families belong to a small Shiite Muslim sect, the Dawoodi Bohra, that is originally from western India.\n\nThe case, the first to be brought under the 1996 law that criminalized female genital mutilation, has been closely followed by human rights advocates and communities where cutting is still practiced and whose members have moved in growing numbers to the United States and other western countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Bernard Friedman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that Congress did not have the authority to pass the law against female genital mutilation and he dismissed key charges filed against the doctors and removed four of the eight defendants from the case."}]
