Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2018\n\nTrump's tweet ignored the fact that the legality of the Mueller probe has been upheld in court on several occasions and that it has secured a number of convictions and is opening a window into the President's own behavior in its prosecutions of his associates.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, laid into the President in his own tweet Sunday, dismissing the President's claim on Twitter that the bureau's raid against Cohen this year was illegal.\n\n\"This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment \u2014 for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth,\" Comey wrote.\n\nThis is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge.

One event that may further irritate the President is Tuesday's sentencing hearing for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.\n\nBut the Russia investigation is only one element in a complex set of political dramas that are playing out before Washington breaks for the Christmas and New Year recess.\n\nAn impasse over Trump's border wall could shutter parts of the government by the end of the week -- the latest battle in the war over immigration that has rocked American politics for more than a decade.\n\nYet another Cabinet member, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is going home trailed by scandal, in another rebuke to the idea that the Trump administration was ever about draining the swamp.\n\nA fresh staff shakeup is playing out in the West Wing, but experience suggests that new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney will fare no better than his predecessors in imposing order on a President who defies management.\n\nObamacare is having another brush with extinction in the courts, just as the Republican House majority built on a vow to overturn the law limps out of town.\n\nAnd the Democratic majority that will take over the House next year is already flexing its muscles after an extraordinary televised showdown between the party's top brass and Trump last week offered a preview of skirmishes to come.\n\nThe President's biggest, indisputable success is the motoring economy and historically low unemployment. But there are growing fears after several volatile weeks that a slowdown is looming, given ebbing global growth, a trade war with China and churning market volatility.\n\nWhite House 'absolutely' ready for a shutdown\n\nThe possibility of a partial shutdown when funding runs out for several key departments at the end of the week appeared to rise on Sunday, with the White House and top Democrats hunkering down over Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.\n\n\"We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,\" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nAsked whether that meant forcing a shutdown to extract the funds from Congress on an issue that was foundational to Trump's presidential campaign, Miller replied, \"If it comes to it, absolutely.\"\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will not get what he wants.\n\n\"President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form,\" Schumer said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nSigns that the gap between the White House and Democrats is deepening raise the possibility that the showdown, if it does shutter government, could develop into the first big clash between the new Congress and the White House in January.\n\nNew trouble for Obamacare\n\nAmericans who rely on the Affordable Care Act got a surprise lump of coal late on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional.\n\nThe move set off a fresh duel over the centerpiece of Barack Obama's domestic agenda that has so far defied all GOP attempts to kill it off.\n\nImmediate legal opinion \u2014 even from some conservatives \u2014 suggested that the sweeping ruling could end up being overturned, though there is a chance the fight over Obamacare's fate could end up yet again in the Supreme Court in a test of the new conservative majority.\n\nThe decision reignited the political wars over health care that Democrats believe played a significant role in their surge to victory in the House in the midterm elections. If that is the case, the Obamacare ruling, paradoxically, may not be good news for the GOP.\n\nBut Trump welcomed the latest threat to his predecessor's legacy.\n\n\"I believe we're going to get really good health care. Exciting things happened over the last 24 hours,\" Trump said at a congressional ball at the White House on Saturday night. Typically though, he gave few details of his vague plans to provide a better alternative to Obamacare, which now looks likely to be a key issue in yet another national election cycle.\n\nSwamp creatures\n\nTrump enters another week looking for another new Cabinet member after announcing the resignation of Zinke, who was facing multiple ethics probes and was a top oversight target of the new Democratic House.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post also reported that Zinke might have been fired if he failed to quit by the end of the year.\n\nPossible replacements include Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who lost his re-election race, sources with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nMulvaney, meanwhile, is gearing up to take on the daunting task of being Trump's third chief of staff. Given the failure of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, to rein in a President who trusts his gut above all, there are few expectations that Mulvaney will calm an often erratic White House and impose discipline, as many predecessors did in other administrations.\n\n\"He's the chief of staff, not chief of the President, right? That's an important distinction,\" David Urban, the political strategist who masterminded Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nStill, Mulvaney appears to have a trusting relationship with the President, following his tenure as his budget chief. And his knowledge of Capitol Hill, gained as a former member of the House, will be an asset as the White House seeks to outmaneuver would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops next year.\n\nRussia to overshadow Trump's Christmas\n\nTrump heads into a Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago resort this week in a position of increasing political and legal vulnerability after weeks of devastating revelations and court filings related to the Russia investigation.\n\nThe President has been implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws alongside Cohen, whose case was referred by Mueller.\n\nCooperation by Cohen and Flynn is helping Mueller take his investigation deep into the President's inner circle. He has now uncovered multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the time of Moscow's election meddling effort and repeated lying about those encounters.\n\nSpeculation is frenzied about one mysterious scene on Friday in which an entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington was locked down over a mystery subpoena appeal involving the special counsel's team.\n\nThings are certain to become more uncomfortable for Trump in the new year. Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is expected to take over the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on \"State of the Union\" that he would seek to secure testimony from Cohen before the President's former fixer reports to prison in March.\n\nThere were also worrying signs for Trump in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found that 62% of respondents believe the President has not been truthful about the Russia investigation.\n\nSince his approval rating was 43% in the survey however, it seems that a portion of those Republicans who are uneasy about the President's attitude toward Mueller still don't see it as a deal breaker for their faith in him."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Comey blasts Trump over tweet about FBI raid of Cohen's office", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/JCR_XuBYLhE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey slammed President Donald Trump for a tweet Sunday accusing the FBI of breaking into the office of his former attorney, Michael Cohen, earlier this year and called on Republicans to speak out in defense of the agency.\n\n\"This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge,\" Comey tweeted Sunday afternoon. \"Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment \u2014 for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth.\"\n\nTrump had lashed out at his estranged former attorney and the FBI in a series of tweets that blasted the Russia investigation.\n\n\"Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started,\" Trump tweeted . \"They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE!

He is part of a group of senior ministers -- Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark -- who believe a new referendum is the only way to break the parliamentary gridlock, it added.\n\nThe Sunday Times also reported May's Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell told Cabinet ministers that a second referendum was \"the only way forward.\" Both men later distanced themselves from the report on Sunday, with Barwell taking to Twitter to deny the claims.\n\nSince there is an unusual level of interest this morning in what I am up to, happy to confirm I am off to play football followed by a few hours work (this will *not* include planning for a 2nd referendum) followed by putting a Christmas tree up\n\nMay also criticized the report, saying in a statement that \"another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's statement came after she hit out on Sunday at her predecessor Tony Blair's own calls for a second referendum. May condemned his call as an \"insult to the office he once held and the people he once served.\" In response, Blair said he was speaking in the national interest and in the interests of democracy.\n\n\"Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying,\" he said according to Press Association. \"What is irresponsible, however, is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out without a deal.\"\n\nBut even if May and the opposition leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn are united in their distaste for a second referendum -- at least publicly -- it is increasingly looking like a viable option.\n\nBritish bookmaker William Hill estimated the probability of a second referendum at 54%. \"We think she (May) is out of options and the most palatable of the two remaining options (which includes revoking Article 50) is a people's vote,\" spokesperson Rupert Adams told CNN.\n\nThose odds began to shorten for a second plebiscite on Monday, when the European Court of Justice ruled that Britain could cancel Brexit without the permission of the other 27 EU members. That decision came as news filtered out that May would abort a parliamentary vote on a withdrawal agreement she drafted with the EU , after it became clear she would lose the vote \"by a significant margin.\"\n\nThe embattled leader then staggered through a vote of no confidence, triggered by hardline Brexiteers. She survived the vote by 200 votes to 117, but what it revealed was one third of her MPs don't support her Brexit plans -- and more than 170 of those who publicly stated they backed her are on the government payroll.\n\nRisk of no deal\n\nAmid this political crisis, which has been called the \"greatest failure of British statecraft since Suez,\" it's unclear how, or if, either side has shifted public opinion.\n\nBy Thursday, Brussels had refused to give May concessions to make her package palatable to British lawmakers. Brexit is more deadlocked than ever; and with just over 100 days before the March 29, 2019 deadline to leave, time to find an alternative to her deal is vanishing. What this risks is crashing out of the EU without a deal, which experts agree would be catastrophic for the British economy.\n\nThe Bank of England warned in November that such a scenario would sink the UK economy into recession\n\nLeaving with no deal means dropping out of the legal and regulatory frameworks that have governed the UK's trade, and much of its internal economy, for more than 40 years. It could disrupt food and manufacturing supplies, with many British exports losing their accreditation to be sold in the EU. The government has also warned planes could be grounded , with up to six months of disruption at some ports."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Analysis: After 30 years, leaders are still fighting about basic truths of climate science", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/VTilxzU6_ls/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Katowice, Poland (CNN) Hidden in the 133-page document agreed upon at the UN climate change talks was a compromise that many consider an infuriating distraction. The countries of the world agreed to welcome the fact that a scientific report on the state of global warming had been produced. But they failed to welcome its findings.\n\nThat seemingly small difference is massive in the hyper-subtle, hyper-polite world of climate diplomacy. So massive, in fact, that the bickering over the wording hung like a cloud over these negotiations. Almost 200 countries agreed -- barely -- to a \"rulebook\" governing the Paris Agreement on climate change, which is meant to help limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nDebate over whether to \"welcome\" the findings or simply \"note\" their existence flared up a week ago. The United States, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia -- among the leading producers of fossil fuels, which cause climate change -- stated publicly that they did not want to \"welcome\" the findings of a report the UN head had called an \"ear-splitting wake-up call.\"\n\nThat report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says carbon pollution must be cut about in half by 2030 and reach \"net zero\" by mid-century to avoid what could be described as disastrous climate change -- superstorms, floods and the like. Polish students walked out of school and into negotiations holding signs that underscored the urgency in this latest assessment of the science: \"12 years left.\"\n\nThat urgency is new, but the basic science is not. Thirty years ago, a NASA scientist testified before Congress that the era of human-induced global warming had begun. In 1992, countries agreed to create the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees talks on global warming now held at the end of each year.\n\nThe fact that discord remains on the basics of the science -- much less the actual process of how to cut pollution and how to govern that process -- stunned some delegates and observers at the talks, which, symbolically, were held in Europe's \"coal capital.\"\n\n\"We were not able to get the strong endorsement we should have,\" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group.\n\nWhat the IPCC report declares is a \"planetary emergency,\" he said.\n\nYet there also was a sense of \"relief\" that the countries could agree on a statement at all -- and that they produced a rulebook that is seen by many as setting the stage for a detailed accounting of emissions and new pledges to cut pollution that will be submitted in 2020.\n\nThose concrete rules are more important than the fights about the validity of the IPCC report, said Yamide Dagnet, project director on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change for the World Resources Institute, a group that studies environmental policy.\n\n\"We really have the foundations we need to move forward, not to wait,\" Dagnet said in Poland. \"We regret what happened last Saturday, but we need to remember it was just a handful of countries that contested this report ... What matters is what you do about it.\"\n\nThe what-to-do-about-it is what concerns Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York. The fight over how to treat the IPCC report, which is regarded as the premier science on this issue, is a massive distraction, he said.\n\n\"What's sad is how much time is wasted on those words because what's really looming over this are the acts of the Trump administration and a few other governments to willfully put the planet at risk,\" Sachs said. \"It's not a matter of belief or denial. It's a matter of putting oil and coal company -- and country -- interests above the interests of all of humanity.\n\n\"It got translated into many frustrating days of arguing over a few words.\"\n\nWhat's happening should be considered \"climate crimes against humanity,\" he said.\n\n\"It's nothing less than that and that's how history will record what the Trump administration is doing right now: These are crimes against humanity,\" he told CNN. \"Many people are dying as a result of this. And it's not a sufficient defense to say, 'I don't believe it.' \"\n\nThe Paris Rulebook is meant to govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which was decided at a similar UN meeting three years ago. US President Donald Trump has pledged to abandon that agreement, but the country still had a presence at the COP24 talks, which concluded in an overtime session late Saturday night.\n\nTrump at times has denied the basic science of climate change, which states that burning coal, oil and natural gas produces emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet. It's become increasingly clear that warming is happening faster than previously thought and with worse results. The US National Climate Assessment published this year says thousands of Americans could die and gross domestic product could take a 10% hit by century's end.\n\nTrump has advocated for burning more coal, a major cause of climate pollution. In Poland, the US delegation held an event dedicated to coal and fossil fuel technologies.\n\nA US State Department spokesperson said the event was intended to show \"the remarkable progress we have made through innovation for cleaner technologies.\"\n\n\"These job-creating innovations have contributed to reducing US emissions while also growing our economy and providing reliable and affordable access to energy,\" the spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe event was interrupted by a group of young people mock-laughing at the display.\n\n\"It's so ridiculous. It's a joke,\" said Vic Barrett, a 19-year-old protester.\n\n\"We're done listening to false solutions and things we know don't work.\"\n\nSome negotiators emphasized that only four countries stood up to decline welcoming the science. If the climate talks were not guided by consensus, that would be a fringe view, they said. There actually is wide agreement on the importance of these reports -- both among governments and the public, said Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for ecological transition.\n\n\"You cannot contradict what has been said by science,\" she said. \"It is fact.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Detention of 100 Christians raises concerns about religious crackdown in China", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/xubVE0rZma4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A prominent Chinese pastor and legal scholar is one of 100 Christians detained by authorities after he was reportedly arrested on allegations of \"inciting subversion of state power.\"\n\nWang Yi and his wife, Jiang Rong, were taken into police custody early last week in the city of Chengdu, where they run the Early Rain Covenant Church, according to ChinaAid, a US-based nonprofit that advocates on behalf of China's Christian communities.\n\nA church parishioner, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed Wang's arrest in a phone call with CNN.\n\nAuthorities with China's National Religion Bureau did not respond to a request from CNN seeking comment.\n\nWestern governments and civil rights advocates outside China have condemned the mass arrest of the Early Rain parish as the latest move in Beijing's stepped up crackdown on independent religious practice.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "4,400-year-old tomb discovered in Egypt", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/gFTSE93L-DE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) \u2014 A more than 4,000-year-old private tomb containing \"exceptionally well-preserved\" drawings has been discovered south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities.\n\nRelated content The best of ancient Egypt\n\nAntiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said the tomb had been discovered at the Saqqara archaeological site and was from the 5th dynasty of the pharaohs, which ruled roughly 4,400 years ago.\n\nThe tomb belonged to a royal purification priest known as \"Wahtye,\" al-Anani said in a statement.

In fact, God awaits us with his mercy, with ever open arms. ... Yes, because of his mercy, God can forgive suicide and heal what has been broken.\"\n\nBut he also said \"we must not call what is bad good, what is wrong right. Because we are Christians, we must say what we know is the truth -- that taking your own life is against God who made us and against everyone who loves us. Our lives are not our own. They are not ours to do with as we please. God gave us life, and we are to be good stewards of that gift for as long as God permits.\"\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1.

Now you will have to work through this pain by yourselves, or with those close to you now who will need to lean on you even as you lean on them.\"\n\nMaison's mother said she had no idea the priest would deliver a homily so drastically different from what the family discussed.\n\n\"He basically called our son a sinner in front of everyone,\" Linda Hullibarger said. \"We had no idea that he was going to do this. ... We've been lifelong members of the church.\"\n\nThe archdiocese said LaCuesta was trying to offer a message of confidence in salvation.\n\n\"We acknowledge, however, that the family wanted a homily based on how their loved one lived, not one addressing how he passed away,\" the archdiocese said.\n\n\"We also know the family was hurt further by Father's choice to share church teaching on suicide, when the emphasis should have been placed more on God's closeness to those who mourn.\"\n\n'He was just an unbelievable son'\n\nAfter LaCuesta's homily, the priest was supposed to turn the floor over to the parents to deliver their remarks, Jeff Hullibarger said.\n\nBut the priest didn't let the parents speak. Instead, \"he proceeded to end the funeral, and the music started,\" Linda Hullibarger said. \"We had to stop the funeral director because everyone just stood up.\"\n\nThe funeral director stopped the music, and the parents were able to honor their son the way they wanted him to be remembered.\n\n\"We would like to celebrate the life of Maison today,\" the parents said. \"He has had a great impact on the lives of many people.

Reach out to those you care about. Show sincerity in your actions. And love forever, unconditionally.\"\n\nThe public is now taking those messages to heart -- and acting on them.\n\nThe Hullibargers' GoFundMe page, which was established before the funeral, listed a goal of $10,000 to help pay for Maison's funeral and burial expenses.\n\nThe Hullibargers said they're grateful for the outpouring of support. But they said their reason for speaking out is because they want LaCuesta to be dismissed, so no other family will suffer the way they did.\n\n\"We're supposed to have a meeting with the archbishop,\" Jeff Hullibarger said. \"We're trying to set that up now. It may be difficult but I think it's something my wife and I have to do.\"\n\n\"We just don't feel that the consequences are where they need to be right now.

How do you teach somebody that?\"\n\nThey also want to make sure the funeral doesn't overshadow the joy that Maison brought to his loved ones.\n\n\"Maison is a great person.

He's expected to sign it into law.\n\nNow that hemp is (almost) legal, there are all kinds of implications for farmers, researchers and consumers.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the plant that's bringing together farmers, potheads and politicians.\n\nHemp has been treated like marijuana\n\nFor decades, the federal government has treated hemp just like any other cannabis plant. Since 1970, it had been classified as a schedule 1 drug on the Drug Enforcement Administration's list of controlled substances, alongside heroin, LSD and marijuana. The DEA defines schedule 1 drugs as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\n\nThe new bill takes hemp off that list.\n\nThe schedule 1 designation made universities reluctant to get involved in hemp research, according to Lawrence Smart, a professor of horticulture at Cornell University.\n\n\"With hemp being legalized now, those restrictions and hesitations about legal jeopardy have been removed,\" Smart said. \"I expect that we'll see many more researchers willing to get involved in hemp research.\"\n\nHemp won't get you high\n\nHemp and marijuana aren't the same thing. They both come from the same species of cannabis, but if you try to smoke hemp, you'll probably just end up with a headache.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon put it bluntly: \"Federal law treats hemp like it's a dangerous drug, but the only thing you're going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting breath, time and lighter fluid.\"\n\nFederal law treats hemp like it's a dangerous drug, but the only thing you're going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting breath, time and lighter fluid. \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) April 12, 2018\n\nHemp has extremely low levels of THC, the compound in marijuana that gets people stoned. It's higher in CBD, a compound that many people believe helps them with anxiety, arthritis, stress and other conditions.\n\nHemp gets a lot of hype over CBD products such as oils, supplements and vapes. Although CBD can come from marijuana, too, it's simpler for companies to use hemp-derived CBD because the extract is legal in all states.\n\nIt's not just CBD, though -- hemp can be used to produce all kinds of things, including clean fuel for cars, building materials, clothes, food and beer.\n\nIt's legal to buy and sell hemp products in the United States. But because growing hemp has been so tightly regulated, the domestic market for hemp products is extremely small. So a lot of those products are imported from Europe, Canada and China.\n\nMitch McConnell (yes, that Mitch McConnell) led the charge to legalize it\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell was a major leader in getting legislation on hemp passed. He put himself on the conference committee for the 2018 farm bill. Monday, he signed the final version of the 2018 farm bill -- and used a pen made from hemp to do it.\n\nMaking it official with my hemp pen!\ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f Proud to have served as conferee on #FarmBill & to fight for #Kentucky priorities. With today's signature, my provision to legalize industrial #hemp is 1 step closer to reality. Looking forward to voting YES on this bill & sending to @POTUS pic.twitter.com/8ypwBebXy7 \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) December 10, 2018\n\nIf you're wondering how the Republican Senate Majority Leader became one of the biggest proponents of a plant once considered a cousin of marijuana, look to his home state of Kentucky.\n\nAnti-smoking campaigns and high cigarette taxes have dealt a blow to Kentucky's once-thriving tobacco industry.\n\nThe USDA estimated that Kentucky farmers harvested an estimated 55,000 acres of burley tobacco, used primarily for cigarette production. That's down 8,000 acres from last year. In the 1990s, burley harvests reached above 200,000 acres.\n\nNow Kentucky has one of the largest hemp industries in the country -- and McConnell says he thinks hemp could become the state's new cash crop.\n\n\"Kentucky has a proven track record for favorable growing conditions for hemp, and there was no legitimate reason why our farmers shouldn't be allowed to grow the crop and capitalize on this growing market,\" McConnell wrote in an op-ed for The Courier-Journal\n\nAt a time when farm income is down and growers are struggling, industrial hemp is a bright spot of agriculture's future. My provision in the Farm Bill will not only legalize domestic hemp, but it will also allow state departments of agriculture to be responsible for its oversight \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) December 11, 2018\n\nHemp is one of those rare bipartisan issues, supported by both Republicans and Democrats in big farming states.\n\nThat doesn't mean weed will become legal, too\n\nIf you're hopeful about what this bill means for legal pot, don't hold your breath.\n\nThis newest Congress seems more open to legalizing pot than ever, but Republicans still control the Senate. And McConnell and many other senators (from both parties) remain opposed to marijuana legalization.\n\nIt's true that Trump hasn't been a vocal opponent of marijuana. But he's certainly not leading the charge to light up.\n\nFarmers stand to win big, but it won't be easy\n\nWith falling prices of crops, increasing debt and an ongoing trade war with China, US farmers have been struggling. Once hemp is legal, farmers will have greater access to a whole new market.\n\nThough hemp products can easily be found in stores, actually growing it was a lot trickier. Previously, farmers could only cultivate hemp for research under pilot programs monitored by their state and the US Department of Agriculture, a provision made possible by the 2014 farm bill.\n\nThe 2018 bill loosens a lot of restrictions on hemp production, and farmers can also apply for USDA crop insurance and grant programs. The bill also specifically allows tribal nations to grow hemp on their lands.\n\nBut growing hemp won't be as simple as growing tomatoes or corn.\n\nThe previous restrictions around growing hemp means there isn't a good seed bank, which captures the plant's genetic diversity. In other words, a lot of plant breeders are starting from scratch in figuring out what pests and diseases they're up against, and how hemp fits in with the rest of their crops.\n\nThere are also concerns about what is classified as hemp -- the legal definition states that the plant cannot contain more than 0.3% THC. Farmers looking to grow the crop will have to comply with regulations set by their states. Farmers in states that don't develop plans for hemp regulation will have to abide by USDA standards.\n\nAnd though the bill opens up hemp growing to a lot more farmers, not everyone gets to participate.\n\nAnyone with a felony drug conviction is banned from growing hemp. It's a provision that critics say disproportionately affects nonwhite people, continuing the legacy of the war on drugs.\n\nMcConnell added the felon ban to appease concerns he received from the Senate Judiciary Committee, the administration and outside interest groups, according to Politico\n\n\"It's ludicrous,\" said Lex Pelger, head of education for the Colorado hemp and CBD company Bluebird Botanicals. \"If there's one thing we could change, that would be it.\"\n\nThe CBD industry is also really excited\n\nHemp oil products are displayed during the Cannabis World Congress in New York.\n\nCBD is everywhere these days -- in lattes, lotion and even dog food.\n\nHemp-derived CBD sales in the United States reached $190 million last year, and one report projects the CBD oil market will reach $1 billion by 2020\n\nPelger predicts retailers will now feel more comfortable about jumping into the CBD game.\n\nThough the DEA has said in recent years that it wouldn't go after businesses and consumers over hemp or CBD, a lot of researchers and retailers were still nervous about entering the market.\n\n\"This will carry the already booming industry to the next level,\" Pelger said.\n\nThe new law also makes things easier for existing CBD businesses. Pelger said it will give companies expanded access to credit card processors and advertising on major platforms.\n\n\"You can imagine running a business and having a number of tools that you need not be available,\" Pegler said.\n\nThe new law is good news for consumers, too, said Pegler.\n\nLoosening restrictions on growing hemp means more competition, more sources of hemp and, advocates hope, better quality.\n\nStill, you should be wary of the hemp hype\n\nThere's a lot of hype about hemp. On the farming side, people claim it's easier to grow and adaptable to most climates. Others say it can clean contaminants from the soil and improve soil quality.\n\nNot true, says Smart.\n\n\"Many of these things have not been properly studied in these controlled experiments and may or may not live up to the hype,\" Smart said.\n\nA lot of people swear by the health and wellness benefits they get from hemp. But because of all the restrictions hemp has been under, there isn't a lot of research on what's effective and what conditions hemp can alleviate.\n\nThe bill is important step because it legitimizes hemp, Pelger said. And now that it's easier to research hemp and enter the industry, we'll likely see more opportunities for innovation.\n\n\"It's going to be fascinating to see what the American market does with this old, intriguing plant.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Iowa Poll: First poll of likely caucusgoers finds Biden, Sanders, O'Rourke atop the field", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/01w0t5CSp_A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden holds the pole position in the first CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll among likely 2020 Democratic caucusgoers, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke joining him as the only possible candidates in the field with double-digit support.\n\nThe new Iowa Poll finds 32% of likely caucusgoers saying they back Biden as their first choice, 19% Sanders, 11% O'Rourke, 8% Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 5% California Sen. Kamala Harris, with the rest of the 20-person field testing below 5% support.\n\nThe top three candidates in Iowa, including O'Rourke's third-place ranking, match the top three in a national CNN poll released Friday . Early results nationally are often driven by name recognition, but in Iowa, the campaign is already underway, with several of the tested candidates having made multiple visits to the state, and at least one having already visited all 99 of the state's counties.\n\nIowa's caucusgoers, who get the first formal say in who the party's nominee will be, mostly say they are looking for a winner (54% want a candidate who can defeat Trump) over ideological purity (40% want one who shares their positions on major issues). Those who prioritize a winning candidate are more apt to back Biden and O'Rourke than the overall pool of likely caucusgoers (36% in that group say they favor Biden, 14% Sanders, 14% O'Rourke) while Sanders outperforms his overall number among those looking for a candidate who shares their issue positions (30% Biden, 26% Sanders, 8% O'Rourke).\n\nOverall, more say that nominating a seasoned political hand (49%) would be a better way for the Democrats to try to to defeat Trump than to nominate a newcomer to politics (36%), and the bevy of senators (plus one congressman) atop the field may reflect that preference. The political newcomers tested -- businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang -- both failed to register much support in the poll.\n\nMost of Iowa's likely Democratic caucusgoers say they'd prefer to see a field with a number of strong contenders (52%) rather than a race dominated by one strong candidate emerging early as a clear frontrunner (41%), and the poll's findings suggest they are open to considering a large number of candidates. That's a contrast with the mood of Democrats nationwide, a majority of whom, after a bruising 2016 nomination battle that lasted through the entire primary season, say they are hopeful for the quick ascension of a frontrunner, according to CNN's poll.\n\nBeyond the horse race question, the Iowa survey asked likely caucusgoers if they could ever consider each of the candidates tested in the poll who they did not choose as their first- or second-choice candidate, or if they would never support that person. Nearly half (46%) of likely caucusgoers said there wasn't a single candidate in the field they would never support. Another 12% said there was only one candidate they would rule out.\n\nAnd many of those tested in the survey remain unknown, even to Iowa's politically active caucusgoers. Majorities said they could not offer an opinion on 12 of the 20 potential candidates when asked a basic favorability rating.\n\nOf the better-known candidates in the field, four merited favorable views from a majority of likely caucusgoers -- Biden (82% favorable), Sanders (74%), Warren (64%) and O'Rourke (53%). Booker and Harris weren't far behind with 49% rating each of them favorably, and former Attorney General Eric Holder also topped 40% favorability, landing at 42% in the poll.\n\nAlthough Holder doesn't register much support as a first or a second choice -- just 1% say they would put him in their top two right now -- 50% say they would ever consider backing him for president, a higher number than just about anyone else who ranked that far down the first-choice scale. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand also comes close with 48% saying they'd consider her, though her favorability rating is a bit lower at 35%.\n\nWhat Iowa Democrats seem certain about is that they don't want to see another run from Hillary Clinton. Almost three-quarters say that if she were to get in the race she would detract from it (72% say so), and her favorability rating is narrowly upside down, with 49% holding an unfavorable opinion vs. 47% who have a positive view.\n\nTwo others who have flirted with presidential runs are also seen as more apt to detract from the race than to add to it: Oprah Winfrey (55% say she would do more to detract than add) and Howard Schultz (55% detract). Views on Michelle Obama, however, tilt sharply in the opposite direction. Three-quarters say she would add to the race for president should she throw her hat in the ring (76%), while just 22% say she would detract from it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "5 takeaways from the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MIlvtJlXqSg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) We have the first look at the state of play in Iowa in advance of the caucuses -- which will kick off the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in roughly a year's time.\n\nThe obvious lesson is that -- at this early stage -- being well-known is the key. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the clear number one choice at 32% -- and he, along with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are the two best-known candidates to Iowa Democrats, with only 4% unsure of their opinion about each of the two men.\n\nBut aside from the topline, what should we take away from the poll? Here are my first observations.\n\n1. Beto is in prime position\n\nThe Texas congressman, who lost a Senate race to Ted Cruz earlier this year, is in third place in the ballot test -- 11% and the only person other than Biden and Sanders in double digits -- but he has considerable room to grow. More than one in three Iowa caucusgoers don't know enough about O'Rourke to offer an opinion about him.

They seek to interview senior administration officials such as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about the rationale behind their decision to add the question.\n\n\"The secretary was personally involved to an extraordinary degree in the project to add a citizenship question,\" argued New York state Attorney General Barbara Underwood in court papers.

It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It requires many restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items. And it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nEven the Trump administration is using the landmark health reform law to try to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nAnd most importantly for many folks, Obamacare prevents insurers from turning away or charging more to those with pre-existing conditions. This provision proved so popular that even Republican candidates found themselves promising to defend it in the recent midterm election in an unsuccessful bid to retain their majority in the House. Some 52 million people, or 27% of non-elderly adults, have a pre-existing condition that would have prevented them from getting coverage prior to Obamacare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\n\n\"You'd be hard pressed to find a part of the health care system that was not touched by the ACA,\" said Larry Levitt, the foundation's senior vice president, of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll this, however, could be swept away by a US District Court judge in Texas, who ruled Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. It seeks to accomplish what Republicans have tried to do for years: repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe decision , which is expected to be appealed, doesn't immediately affect Americans' coverage. But if it's upheld by higher courts, it could turn back the clock on the nation's health care system to before Obamacare became the law of the land in 2010, when the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 18.2%. It's now 10.3%.\n\nHere's what's at risk:\n\nMedicare\n\nObamacare has meant lower premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing for the roughly 60 million senior citizens and disabled Americans enrolled in the program.\n\nThe health reform law made many changes to Medicare. It slowed the growth of payment rates to hospitals and other providers, reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and improved benefits for enrollees. The Obama administration estimated that the typical Medicare beneficiary pays about $700 less in premiums and cost sharing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder Obamacare, Medicare enrollees also receive free preventative benefits, such as screenings for breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nAnd Obamacare helped close the gap in Medicare's drug coverage and was on track to completely eliminate it by 2020. Senior citizens have to pay more for drugs while they are in the donut hole, which lies between the initial coverage and catastrophic coverage phases. (The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 accelerated the closing of the coverage gap to 2019.)\n\nBut Obamacare does mean higher costs for more affluent beneficiaries. The law froze the threshold for the Medicare premium surcharge at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples, so more people have become subject to it. The Affordable Care Act also added a premium surcharge on drug coverage for higher-income enrollees.\n\nEmployer-sponsored insurance\n\nObamacare requires that companies with at least 50 employees provide affordable insurance to their staffers who work more than 30 hours a week.\n\nThis mandate didn't have a major impact on the 150 million workers who are insured through their jobs. Most larger employers already offer coverage for full-time workers. However, setting the bar at 30 hours a week prompted some employers to extend coverage to more of their staff, since many companies had considered that threshold to be part-time.\n\nAlso, the law allows children to remain on their parents' plans until they turn 26. This has proven to be one of the more popular Obamacare provisions and has helped lower the uninsured rate of this age group.\n\nWorkers also no longer have to pay for contraceptives and preventative screenings, such as colonoscopies and mammograms. Obamacare requires these be provided free of charge.\n\nThe ACA also prohibits employers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on benefits and caps out-of-pocket spending.\n\nObamacare also had an impact on employees who work at companies with fewer than 50 workers. Insurers can no longer ban workers with pre-existing conditions or ask them to pay more. The law requires plans to cover an array of benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. And it limits insurers from charging older workers premiums more than three times those of younger workers.\n\nHowever, this more comprehensive coverage has come at a price. Obamacare's regulations caused premiums to spike, forcing some small businesses to stop offering health insurance to their workers.\n\nIndividual market\n\nObamacare has had the largest impact on the individual market, which was largely unregulated prior to the health reform law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions and banned them from charging the sick more. The law ended the practice of insurers imposing annual or lifetime caps on benefits, and it also placed limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. It mandates that insurers provide more comprehensive benefits, including medication, maternity and mental health. It prevents insurers from charging women more and restricts premiums for older folks to no more than three times those of young adults.\n\nObamacare set up health insurance exchanges to allow Americans to shop for individual policies and created federal subsidies so low- and moderate-income enrollees could buy policies for less than 10% of their income. It also limits the deductibles and co-payments for lower-income policyholders.\n\nNearly 11.8 million people signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. About 2.5 million Americans purchased individual policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges. They cannot apply for subsidies, but receive all of the other benefits.\n\nMany consumers, however, have not been happy with the changes Obamacare wrought -- particularly because they caused premiums to spike. Many middle class Americans who don't qualify for subsidies have dropped their coverage, saying it's now unaffordable.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to undermine the law by providing alternative coverage -- such as short-term health policies -- that don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's provisions, particularly those protecting people with pre-existing conditions. It is also allowing states to apply for changes to their Obamacare programs. The main beneficiaries of these efforts are younger and healthier Americans, who will be able to buy less comprehensive policies with lower premiums.\n\nMedicaid\n\nBefore Obamacare, most Medicaid enrollees were low-income children, pregnant women, parents, the disabled and the elderly.\n\nThe health reform law opened up the program to low-income adults with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty threshold -- $16,700 for a single person -- in states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid or passed ballot measures to do so. Nearly 12 million Americans gained coverage under this provision as of 2016, the most recent figures available.\n\nUnder the program, the federal government paid 100% of the costs of the expansion population for the first three years and is slowly lowering the reimbursement rate to 90%."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Check your fridge and pantry for food products recalled this week", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/PuVurUELcBs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Before the family gathers for a holiday meal, here's all the food you should purge from your pantry.

One man accuses her of being a drug addict.\n\nManal is an actor in a social experiment organized by the Lebanese women's rights group ABAAD last month. During the nine or so hours when Manal emulated a rape victim, not a single bystander called the police.\n\nThe aim of the experiment -- part of a weeks-long campaign called #ShameOnWho -- was to expose the stigma attached to rape victims, activists say.\n\n\"In general, people think that she's the loose one, she's the one to blame and she's the one who should be held accountable,\" says ABAAD's founder Ghida Anani.\n\n\"We're trying to encourage women who are survivors of rape to speak up, to get out from the cycle and culture of victim-blaming,\" says Anani.\n\nA women's rights protester holds a #ShameOnWho campaign banner at Beirut's yearly marathon this November.\n\nDespite concerted movements by Lebanese civil society to tackle gender-based violence, the problem is growing. In 1994, 30% of women in Lebanon said they experienced some form of violence, according to United Nations figures. Today that figure is closer to 60%, according to data compiled by ABAAD from various ministries, the police and media reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if the increase in claims is due to a greater willingness to report the violence or an actual rise in the number of attacks or a mix of both, Anani says.\n\nBut activists have pushed hard against the trend. Awareness campaigns promoting gender equity are prominent and hard-hitting, and activists have kept up sustained pressure on government to introduce legislation to protect women.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon's parliament passed its first-ever law criminalizing domestic violence. In 2017, it repealed a legal loophole that acquitted rapists who marry their victims. Still, Lebanon's penal code has some way to go. No minimum legal age for marriage exists in the country and marital rape remains legal.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nIn five Beirut locations, artists volunteering with ABAAD have painted black and white murals of rapists' faces, sketched out from the memories of the survivors.\n\n\"These are wanted men,\" says Anani. \"Today, the spotlight should be on the people who are doing this kind of behavior and not those who are subject to it.\"\n\nNot yet willing to step out of the shadows, survivors are speaking out through artists and activists.\n\nOne woman, identified as Reham, recorded her story on an audio file.

We hear these stories on Facebook, or on TV but we never really encounter these people in our lives.\"\n\nBut Lebanon's civil society appears determined to give women a larger platform and counter social practices perceived as sexist.\n\nLast month, women's rights activists called for the boycott of the television channel MTV Lebanon after it aired an interview with Mohammed al-Nheily, the husband and convicted killer of 33-year-old Manal Assi, in a program on Lebanese prisoners called Out of Freedom. Activists criticized what they said was an overly sympathetic portrayal of the man who bludgeoned Assi to death. In his tearful interview, Nheily said he \"regretted\" the 2014 murder and longed to \"turn back time so that neither (he) nor Manal had done wrong.\"\n\nThe episode also featured an actress depicting Manal from beyond the grave, urging non-profit organizations and lawyers to \"stop speaking on her behalf\" and suggesting that the murder could have been avoided if only she and Mohammed had \"talked about (their) feelings.\"\n\n\"It is clear beyond doubt that the aim of this episode -- however much you deny it -- was to justify the murder by having the interview focus on the anger that possessed Mohammed Al-Nheily,\" wrote women's rights group KAFA in a Facebook post addressing MTV.\n\n\"The case was summed up as a crime in which both parties bore equal responsibility,\" it added.\n\nMTV said it gave Nheily \"the same treatment\" as previous prisoners it interviewed in Out of Freedom.\n\n\"The program gave an opportunity to the killer of Manal al-Assi to speak in the same way that it gave an opportunity to 90 prisoners before him. They all provided the reasons and circumstances that led them to commit the different crimes, including domestic crimes,\" said the program's presenter Samir Youssef in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The case of Manal Assi coincided with the efforts of non-profit organizations to develop women's rights laws. So, it was natural that this episode would have caused reactions, especially since the murderer Mohamad al-Nheily was speaking to the media for the first time since he committed the crime.\"\n\nShamed into silence\n\n\"I called it a rape of my rights,\" says one woman, who requests anonymity to avoid personal repercussions.\n\nShe says an ex-lover once secretly videotaped a sexual encounter between them and blackmailed her with it.\n\nShe says he threatened to send the sex tape to her colleagues and family.\n\n\"He said ...

And this research has been supported by the federal government since the 1950s.\n\nDuring the hearing, debate focused on the merits and value of two different types of humanized mice -- one requires fetal tissue, the other does not. Humanized mice, which possess human cells, DNA tissues or immune systems, are used in some biomedical research.\n\nAccording to the scientist whose humanized mouse research was debated between the two sides, some truth can be found on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhat's the issue with human fetal tissue?\n\nIn September, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled a contract with a fetal tissue procurement company due to concerns that the company was not meeting regulations. Subsequently, HHS initiated an audit of human fetal tissue acquisitions and a review to understand whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\n\nHowever, those opposed to abortion have sought, for decades, to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue, while those in the research world support its use.\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report. The National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows.\n\nNot only has the federal government funded fetal tissue research for more than seven decades with procurement governed by an \"extensive regulatory framework,\" but fetal tissue research has a \"long history of support from both sides of the aisle,\" said Judy Chu, the Democratic representative from California who sits on the Steering and Policy Committee, during the hearing. Only today do pro-life \"extremists\" threaten the use of fetal tissue in research.\n\nOf the three scientists who presented testimony to the committee, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, a molecular and cell biologist and an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice, an advisory board member for the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center argued that several ethical alternatives to human fetal tissue are currently available to researchers -- including donated human tissues, bone marrow as well as stem cells and their derivatives.\n\nDr. Sally Temple, a board member and former president with the International Society for Stem Cell Research , which promotes dissemination of ideas and information related to stem cells, said \"the alternatives mentioned may be useful at times but cannot fully replace fetal tissue.\" She noted that fetal tissue, being at a different developmental stage, has \"unique properties\" that donated neonatal tissue lacks and therefore \"the consensus of our field\" is that fetal tissue is \"essential\" for biomedical research.\n\nDiscussion landed on humanized mice when Temple argued that the humanized mouse model created using human fetal tissue, has made advances in HIV research possible. Lee and Prentice said a new humanized mouse model created using non-fetal human tissue sources might serve as an adequate substitute.\n\nNot so fast, said Matt Brown, an assistant scientist in the department of surgery at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the creators of the new humanized mice created without fetal tissue. \"I'm caught in the middle of this,\" Brown told CNN after the hearing, which he did not participate in or attend.\n\nThough he's excited to develop an alternative humanized mouse model, he said more rigorous scientific testing is needed to understand the types of research it can be used for and its value. So it's too early to suggest his alternative model could replace the fetal tissue model, he said, though he speculates his humanized mouse could be better, in some cases, than the current standard.\n\n\"It's a very nuanced discussion,\" said Brown. \"If they go ahead and ban this -- you know black and white, let's ban it all -- there will be so many unintended side effects,\" said Brown. \"They could do so much damage if they ban this the wrong way; it could set science back years and hurt patients, too.\"\n\nAt the same time, he believes scientists \"should listen to people's concerns -- people feel very strongly about [human fetal tissue]. And no scientist wants to use this unless they have to [based on the science],\" he said. \"Scientists should pursue alternatives when they are available.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe hearing drew stark lines in the sand between the two sides, yet middle ground does exist, as suggested by a close listen to arguments. For example, Temple admitted some research that previously relied on fetal tissue is now done in alternative ways, while Prentice noted that the funding of historic cell lines originally derived from aborted fetuses is not in question. And, seemingly thinking aloud, Mark Meadows, the Republican representative from North Carolina who chaired the hearing, suggested the possibility of continued federal funding to support ongoing fetal tissue research, with new projects funded only if they used alternatives.\n\nIn a statement to the committees, Brown expressed modest hopes. He simply wished for a \"constructive dialogue\" regarding scientists' need to access tissue, including fetal tissue, to advance the \"cutting edge research we are undertaking with the goal of alleviating patient suffering worldwide.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "New EU referendum would break faith with Britons, May to warn MPs", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46586673", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nHolding another referendum on the EU would \"break faith with the British people\", Theresa May will warn MPs.\n\nFormer PMs John Major and Tony Blair are among those urging a new referendum if MPs cannot agree on a way forward.\n\nBut the prime minister will argue that it would do \"irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics\" and would \"likely leave us no further forward\".\n\nLast week she called off a Commons vote on her Brexit deal, admitting it was likely to be heavily rejected.\n\nMr Blair said last week that while he admired Mrs May's determination to get her deal through, with so many MPs opposed to it there was \"literally no point in carrying on digging\".\n\nHe said after 30 months of negotiation, and with the government in \"a mess\", giving the final say to the people would become the \"logical\" outcome if every other option were to be exhausted.\n\nBut Mrs May will tell MPs on Monday: \"Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum.\n\n\"Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver.\n\n\"Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last.\n\n\"And another vote which would further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.\"\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nOn Sunday she said Mr Blair's backing for another referendum was \"an insult to the office he once held\" and risked undermining Brexit negotiations.\n\nBusiness Secretary Greg Clark echoed the prime minister's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, arguing that a fresh vote would \"continue uncertainty\".\n\nHe also said, that if Parliament did not approve Mrs May's deal, it should be \"invited to say what it would agree with\" on a Brexit deal.\n\n\"Businesses expect MPs to take responsibility rather than just be critics,\" Mr Clark added.\n\nHowever Dame Margaret Beckett, a former foreign secretary who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a fresh referendum, said the case was becoming \"overwhelming\" and was \"the best way forward for our country\".\n\n\"A new public vote would be different from the referendum in 2016 because we now know more about what Brexit means.\n\n\"Any effort to force Brexit over the line without checking that it has the continued consent of the British people will only reinforce divisions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, writing in his Daily Telegraph column, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said a second referendum would \"provoke instant, deep and ineradicable feelings of betrayal\".\n\nThe Brexiteer said the idea a fresh poll would be held was \"sickening\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Could there be a second Brexit vote?\n\nThe prime minister is due to update MPs at 15:30 GMT on last week's European Council summit, where she made an appeal to EU leaders to help get the deal \"over the line\".\n\nShe went to Brussels at the end of a week in which she delayed the Commons vote on her Brexit deal, admitting it would be rejected by a significant margin, and then went on to survive a vote of no confidence in her leadership by Conservative MPs by 200 votes to 117.\n\nShe had been seeking legal assurances over the controversial \"backstop\" plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if no trade deal is reached.\n\nBut EU leaders told her the negotiated withdrawal agreement was \"not open for renegotiation\", although some clarification was possible.\n\nMrs May said on Friday that her talks with EU leaders had shown that \"further clarification and discussion\" was possible and that the UK would be \"working expeditiously over the coming days to seek those further assurances I believe MPs will need\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?

Two more families have told the BBC of their concerns with the service after their sons had the same \"extreme\" treatment without their knowledge.\n\nIn both cases, they were expecting their sons, who have learning disabilities, to have a small number of teeth removed but were left shocked when they emerged from the operating theatre with no teeth left.\n\nWorcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, which runs the dental service, insisted it followed the correct procedures for vulnerable patients, while three clinical commissioning groups are investigating Ms Johnston's death.\n\nCampaigners have said they are often told of poor communication between disabled patients and their families, and that dentists should intervene earlier to avoid taking out every tooth in a person's mouth.\n\n\"There should never be a situation where such extreme treatment comes as a surprise,\" said Sarah Coleman, from Mencap.\n\nWhat happened to Rachel Johnston?\n\nImage copyright Diana Johnston Image caption Diana Johnston says she wants to know why her daughter Rachel died\n\nA passion for singing 1980s pop star Shakin' Stevens and the computer-animated film Ice Age helped make Ms Johnston, 49, the life and soul of Pirton Grange Care Home.\n\nBut a lifetime of dental problems meant the Johnston family were told earlier this year a \"full dental clearance\" - the removal of all her teeth - may be needed.\n\n\"I asked if they could take a few out at a time - it seemed like a big operation - but was told they only wanted to put her under the general anaesthetic once,\" said her mother Diana Johnston, from Evesham.\n\nOn 26 October, her daughter, who suffered brain damage after contracting meningitis as a baby, was anaesthetised at Kidderminster Hospital for the removal of all her teeth.\n\nMs Johnston's temperature dropped during the procedure but after coming round she was in high spirits, her mother said, and was discharged four hours later.\n\nThe following day, care home staff phoned her mother to say she was very unwell.\n\n\"She was bleeding quite a bit and her tongue had swollen right up. But she was just lying there. It was like there was no life.\"\n\nThe following day she was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties.\n\nHer daughter was put on a life support machine but her family was eventually told there was nothing more doctors could do for her.\n\nShe died on 13 November, 10 days after the machine was turned off. A coroner is investigating.\n\n\"She was so strong - she contracted meningitis at six weeks old and doctors said if she makes it to 10 you'll have the biggest bonus,\" said Mrs Johnston.\n\n\"Well she got 39 more years. She fought everything that was thrown at her, which makes what happened even more difficult.\"\n\nWhat concerns do other families have?\n\nImage copyright Kerry Ashmore Image caption Nora Ashmore says she was shocked to find her son Kelvin had had all his teeth taken out\n\nNora Ashmore's son Kelvin had suffered tooth decay after years of problems brushing his teeth.\n\n\"He'd bite down on the toothbrush, it was very difficult,\" said Mrs Ashmore.\n\nThree years ago, aged 32, he had to go to Worcestershire Royal Hospital to have some decayed teeth removed.\n\n\"I had to sign a form for them to do what was necessary,\" his mother recalled.\n\n\"When he went into recovery, there was a lot of blood [around his mouth]. I thought it seemed a lot for a few teeth.\"\n\nMrs Ashmore said a man and woman then told her all her son's teeth had been taken out.\n\n\"I said 'pardon?' I couldn't believe what they were saying. I was so shocked.\"\n\nMrs Ashmore said she felt the procedure was \"so radical, so drastic\".\n\n\"If they'd have said beforehand 'we think this is the best way forward', I might have understood.\n\n\"It's something we've tried to forget. You think 'they must know best'.\"\n\nIt is a situation familiar to Debbie and Jon Perry. Their son, in his 30s, also had all his teeth taken out by the trust around the same time as Kelvin.\n\nThey said they were expecting him to have a deep clean, some fillings and a few extractions.\n\n\"We signed some documents but they didn't tell us they were going to take all his teeth,\" said Mrs Perry.\n\n\"We were very shocked,\" her husband added. \"He was very distressed. He was looking at us, like, 'what have they done?'\"\n\n\"It's affected him a lot. He's got no confidence now, doesn't want to go out on days out, holidays, anything,\" said Mrs Perry.\n\nWhy are people with learning disabilities prone to tooth decay?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThere are many reasons, including behavioural problems that affect teeth brushing, gastric reflux, and some chromosomal disorders.\n\nThe NHS runs community dental services around the UK to look after people who find going to the dentist difficult.\n\nDentists must obtain informed consent before carrying out treatment but some patients do not have the mental capacity to do this.\n\nA dentist will assess the patient's capacity in line with principles set out in the Mental Capacity Act (England) 2005, said Charlotte Waite, who chairs the British Dental Association's England Community Dental Services Committee.\n\n\"Where patients do not have this capacity, the dentist may provide treatment in the patient's best interest,\" she said.\n\n\"The legislation states that dentists should provide treatment that is the 'least restrictive of the patient's rights and freedom of action'.\"\n\nIt is not always possible to complete a full examination of a patient's teeth before they undergo anaesthetic.\n\n\"In those cases, the dentist should usually discuss the potential possibilities with all the appropriate people involved in making a decision that's in the best interest of the patient,\" said Ms Waite.\n\nWhat does the health trust say?\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption Rachel Johnston was put under anaesthetic at Kidderminster Hospital\n\nDecisions sometimes have to be made in the treatment room because dentists do not want to pause a procedure while a patient is under anaesthetic, a spokesman for Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust said.\n\nDentists do not want to risk patients being anaesthetised several times, so in some cases decide to remove non-restorable teeth to avoid this, said Rod Smith, Associate Medical Director for Specialist Primary Care.\n\n\"The consent process is clear that fillings would be done if the teeth are restorable, with extractions carried out if not, and that ultimately the aim is to render the patient dentally fit at the end of the procedure,\" he added.\n\n\"The feedback we receive across our community dental service is very positive but we will always listen to patients and families to see if there is more we can do to ensure their experience is a positive one.\"\n\nIn the case of Ms Johnston's death, a spokesperson for the three Worcestershire CCGs said: \"Whilst it would not be appropriate for us to discuss the details of any specific case, we can confirm that all relevant agencies are committed to work together to share the facts and review the circumstances leading up to a recent case of the death of a person with a learning disability.\"\n\nWhat do organisations that help people with learning disabilities think?\n\n\"Sadly, it is very common for there to be a lack of communication between healthcare professionals and people with a learning disability and their families,\" Sarah Coleman, Mencap's health policy officer, said.\n\n\"More must be done to ensure people with a learning disability can access good quality dental care as soon as they need it, before we reach the point where multiple teeth need to be extracted.\n\n\"People with a learning disability deserve the same quality of treatment and care as anyone else, and it's simply not good enough when they don't get it.\n\n\"Making a best interest decision on a matter such as whether to give a general anaesthetic, or to remove teeth, is extremely serious and requires careful consideration.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: The massive CO2 emitter you may not know about", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46455844", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:51", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nCement is the most widely used man-made material in existence. It is second only to water as the most-consumed resource on the planet.\n\nBut, while cement - the key ingredient in concrete - has shaped much of our built environment, it also has a massive carbon footprint.\n\nCement is the source of about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to think tank Chatham House.\n\nIf the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world - behind China and the US. It contributes more CO2 than aviation fuel (2.5%) and is not far behind the global agriculture business (12%).\n\nCement industry leaders are in Poland for the UN's climate change conference - COP24 - to discuss ways of meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change. To do this, annual emissions from cement will need to fall by at least 16% by 2030.\n\nSo, how did our love of concrete end up endangering the planet? And what can we do about it?\n\nIn praise of concrete\n\nAs the key building material of most tower blocks, car parks, bridges and dams, concrete has, for the haters, enabled the construction of some of the world's worst architectural eyesores.\n\nIn the UK, it helped the massive wave of post-World War Two development - much of it still dividing opinion - with several of the country's major cities, such as Birmingham, Coventry, Hull and Portsmouth, largely defined by the concrete structures from that building push.\n\nImage caption Birmingham is known for its concrete structures\n\nBut concrete is also the reason some of the world's most impressive buildings exist.\n\nSydney Opera House, the Lotus Temple in Delhi, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as well as the magnificent Pantheon in Rome - boasting the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world - all owe their form to the material.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The unreinforced concrete dome of the Pantheon in Rome has yet to be beaten in size\n\nA mix of sand and gravel, a cement binder and water, concrete is so widely embraced by architects, developers and builders because it is a remarkably good construction material.\n\n\"It's affordable, you can produce it almost anywhere and it has all the right structural qualities that you want to build with for a durable building or for infrastructure,\" explains Felix Preston, deputy research director at the Energy, Environment and Resources Department at Chatham House.\n\nDespite known durability problems with using steel reinforcement, which can crack concrete from the inside, it is still the go-to material across the world.\n\n\"Building without concrete, although it is possible, is challenging,\" says Mr Preston.\n\nGrowth of cement industry\n\nIt is these unrivalled attributes of concrete that have helped boost global cement production since the 1950s, with Asia and China accounting for the bulk of growth from the 1990s onwards.\n\nProduction has increased more than thirtyfold since 1950 and almost fourfold since 1990. China used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in the entire 20th Century.\n\nBut with Chinese consumption now appearing to level off, most future growth in construction is expected to happen in the emerging markets of South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - driven by rapid urbanisation and economic development.\n\nThe floor area of the world's buildings is projected to double in the next 40 years, say Chatham House researchers, requiring cement production to increase by a quarter by 2030.\n\nConcrete has a long history\n\nImage copyright Leeds Library\n\nWhile many of us assume concrete is a recent addition to our cities, architects and builders have actually been using it for millennia.\n\nThe earliest use of concrete is believed to have been more than 8,000 years ago, with traders in Syria and Jordan creating concrete floors, buildings and underground cisterns.\n\nLater, the Romans were known to be masters of concrete, building the Pantheon in Rome in 113-125AD, with its 43m-diameter free-standing concrete dome the largest in the world.\n\nBut the concrete used in our modern-built environment owes much of its make-up to a process patented in the early 19th Century by bricklayer Joseph Aspdin of Leeds.\n\nHis new technique of roasting limestone and clay in an oven and then grinding it to a powder to make \"artificial stone\" is now known as Portland cement - still the key ingredient in almost all modern concrete.\n\nBut, despite its ubiquitous presence, concrete's environmental credentials have come under increased scrutiny in the last couple of decades.\n\nNot only does the production of Portland cement involve quarrying - causing airborne pollution in the form of dust - it also requires the use of massive kilns, which require large amounts of energy.\n\nThe actual chemical process of making cement also emits staggeringly high levels of CO2.\n\n'Action needed'\n\nThe sector has made progress - improvements in the energy-efficiency of new plants and burning waste materials instead of fossil fuels has seen the average CO2 emissions per tonne of output fall by 18% over the last few decades, according to Chatham House.\n\nThe newly-established Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), currently representing about 35% of the world's cement production capacity and with a focus on sustainable development, is at COP24.\n\nChief executive Benjamin Sporton says the fact the organisation now exists \"is a demonstration of the commitment of the industry to sustainability, including taking action on climate change\".\n\nThe GCCA is due to publish a set of sustainability guidelines, which its membership will have to follow.\n\n\"By bringing together global players to provide leadership and focus, as well as delivering a detailed work programme, we can help ensure a sustainable future for cement and concrete, and for the needs of future generations,\" Mr Sporton says.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Shanghai, like many Chinese cities, has seen a rapid rise in development\n\nBut despite the promise, Chatham House argues that the industry is reaching the limits of what it can do with current measures.\n\nIf the sector has any hope of meeting its commitments to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, it will need to look at overhauling the cement-making process itself, not only reducing the use of fossil fuels.\n\n'Clinker' - the big polluter\n\nIt is the process of making \"clinker\" - the key constituent of cement - that emits the largest amount of CO2 in cement-making.\n\n1. Raw materials, mainly limestone and clay, are quarried and crushed\n\n2. They are ground and mixed with other materials - such as iron ore or ash\n\n3. They are fed into huge, cylindrical kilns and heated to about 1,450C (2,640F)\n\n4. The process of \"calcination\" splits the material into calcium oxide and CO2\n\n5. A new substance called clinker emerges as marble-sized grey balls\n\n6. The clinker is cooled, ground and mixed with gypsum and limestone\n\n7. The cement is transported to ready-mix concrete companies\n\nIn 2016, world cement production generated around 2.2 billion tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 8% of the global total. More than half of that came from the calcination process.\n\nTogether with thermal combustion, 90% of the sector's emissions could be attributed to the production of clinker.\n\nBecause of this, Mr Preston and his colleagues argue the sector urgently needs to pursue a number of CO2 reduction strategies.\n\nFurther efforts on energy efficiency, a move away from fossil fuels and pursuing carbon capture and storage will help, but can only do so much.\n\n\"We've got a long way to close the gap,\" Mr Preston says.\n\nWhat the industry really needs to do is plough efforts into producing new types of cement, he argues. In fact, low-carbon cements and \"novel cements\" might do away with the need for clinker altogether.\n\nNew cements\n\nOne of those trying to drum up greater support for such alternative cements is Ginger Krieg Dosier, co-founder and CEO of BioMason - a start-up in North Carolina that uses trillions of bacteria to grow bio-concrete bricks.\n\nThe technique, which involves placing sand in moulds and injecting it with microorganisms, initiates a process similar to the one that creates coral.\n\n\"I have a long fascination with marine cements and structures,\" explains Ms Krieg Dosier, a trained architect who was surprised to find no real green alternatives to bricks and masonry when she began research at an architectural firm more than 10 years ago.\n\nThe discovery led her to create her own solution, which, after years of development, now takes only four days. It happens at room temperature, without the need for fossil fuels or calcination - two of the main sources of the cement industry's CO2 emissions.\n\nMs Krieg Dosier believes green cements and technologies such as hers offer a solution to the sector's emissions issue.\n\n\"Traditional Portland-based cement production practices will continue to release CO2 due to its fundamental chemistry,\" she says, adding that rather than turning to carbon capture and storage, we should be investing more in techniques that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n\"Alternative cements and binding technologies go beyond evolutionary CO2 capture to revolutionary methods that fundamentally sequester CO2.\"\n\n'Disruptive forces'\n\nAlongside such alternative cements, other \"disruptive\" forces are also beginning to drive change. Digitalisation, machine learning and an increasing awareness of sustainability are all having an impact on the cement industry's culture.\n\n\"It's partly changing because of how people want to live, but also because of our ability to dream up new and innovative structures and test those with computer models,\" says Mr Preston. \"There's also the ability to build things more cheaply with robots - with automation.\"\n\nBut changing processes quickly enough to meet the cement industry's obligations will be a challenge.\n\nImage copyright BioMason Image caption Bio-cement start-up BioMason grows bricks out of sand and bacteria\n\nThe sector is dominated by a small number of major producers who are reluctant to experiment or change business models. Architects, engineers, contractors and clients are also, rather understandably, cautious about using new building materials.\n\n\"This quite slow-moving, difficult-to-change sector is starting to bump against these quite profound disruptions that we're starting to see in the built environment,\" says Mr Preston.\n\nBut, with very few low-carbon cements reaching commercialisation, and none being applied at scale in an industry where bigger and taller is often the ambition, it looks likely that sustained government support will be needed.\n\nWithout governments applying pressure on the industry or providing funding, it may not be possible to get the next generation of low-carbon cements out of the laboratory and into the market within the required timescale.\n\nAnd the timescale is ever-shrinking.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the leading international body on global warming - last month argued the global average temperature rise needed to be kept below 1.5C - not 2C as noted in the Paris Agreement. This means CO2 emissions need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030.\n\nLike other young companies, Ms Krieg Dosier describes the difficulties of simultaneously developing and marketing her products and scaling up manufacturing processes to compete within the wider construction industry.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Concrete is the chosen material for most large-scale projects\n\nBut she thinks there are reasons to be optimistic.\n\n\"I do believe the construction industry is approaching a point where alternative materials will be more widely adopted,\" she says. \"This is in part due to market demand, other innovative technologies and wider concern for climate change.\"\n\nMr Preston says it is imperative that governments and industry now act quickly at a time when global development is expected to rise but CO2 emissions need to fall.\n\n\"There's a desperate need for quality, affordable homes,\" he says. \"There's a need for new infrastructure. We can only square this circle if we can dramatically improve the way that we build, so that overall these buildings are constructed with, as close as possible, net zero emissions.\"\n\nDesign by Lilly Huynh."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Five key takeaways from climate summit", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46582265", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:52", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Kiara Worth/IISD/ENB\n\nDelegates to the UN climate conference in Poland have reached agreement on how to implement the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, which comes into force in 2020. What are the key points to come out of the meeting?\n\n1. The rules are key to the game\n\nHowever dull it may be, the operational rules for the 2015 Paris climate agreement will govern the way the world tackles climate change for decades to come.\n\nThe key thing was not to unravel the carefully negotiated Paris agreement by having one set of rules for the rich countries and another one for the poor.\n\nBy that measure the conference was a success with China showing leadership by not pushing for a return to the old ways of countries who did, and countries who didn't.\n\nAlso helping that effort was the US. Ensuring that the China and the US face similar regulations has long been a key of American policy.\n\nKeeping everyone on the same page also delighted the EU. Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete explained how the new rules would work.\n\n\"We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends.\"\n\nTo keep everyone in check, the rules will also contain a compliance mechanism, which means that countries that don't submit their reports on time will face an inquiry.\n\nThe new regulations are \"flexible\" for developing countries, meaning they can sign up to the rules at a later date.\n\n2. Science is worth fighting for\n\nOne of the biggest rows at this meeting was over a key scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nA group of countries including Saudi Arabia, US, Kuwait and Russia refused to \"welcome\" the IPCC study.\n\nThey merely wanted to \"note\" the contents.\n\nImage copyright Kiara Worth/IISD/ENB\n\nEfforts to find a compromise ended in failure.\n\nHowever that was not the end of the matter.\n\nThe vast majority of countries felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference.\n\nTheir efforts did finally ensure that the IPCC was recognised - but many felt it was a token effort.\n\n\"That science is unsettling and it doesn't connect it to the need to do more,\" said Camilla Born from the environmental think tank E3G.\n\n\"The deal looks at it in isolation, it's an elegant compromise but it's not really enough.\"\n\n3. International spirit is still alive\n\nMany countries had worried that with the rise of nationalism in many countries and the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president, the international co-operation needed to tackle climate change might be in danger.\n\nFor many getting agreement here in Katowice was less about technical rules and more about showing that the international spirit is still alive and has teeth.\n\n\"I think the beauty of multilateralism is that it is the effort of everybody,\" said Spanish Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera.\n\n\"And what we have seen is that everybody has supported the package, no single country has decided to step down.\n\n\"It is very difficult. It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat. It is not so easy but we have got it. That's fantastic!\"\n\n4. A win for the process but not for the planet?\n\nWhile negotiators have been congratulating themselves on a job well done in landing the rulebook, there are many voices here who feel that the agreement does not go far enough.\n\nThey point to the strength of the science, and the public recognition of the impacts of climate change seen this year in heatwaves and wildfires.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nMany environmental campaigners believe that Katowice was a missed opportunity for radical action.\n\n\"We have ended up here with more of a coal trade fair than a climate convention,\" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid, referring to the efforts to promote coal by Poland and the US at this conference.\n\n\"We haven't acted in good faith, particularly for the young, that we takes seriously what science is telling us and we are responding to it. That message didn't come through.\n\n\"If people think the rulebook is the way to get the world on that path, it is not robust or ambitious enough.\"\n\n5. New voices are emerging\n\nOne of the most striking things about this conference of the parties was the presence of energised young people in far greater numbers than I have ever seen them at a COP before.\n\nImage copyright Kiara Worth/IISD/ENB\n\nClimate change chimes with young people in a way that is sometimes missing with older people, who make up the bulk of negotiators here.\n\nThe sense that perhaps this UN process doesn't quite connect with the modern world was summed up best by Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now their lead climate negotiator.\n\n\"Almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed.\n\n\"We are still using the same old, dinosaur language. Still saying the same old words.\n\n\"Still making the same tedious points.\"\n\nIt would be hard to argue with this view given the shenanigans that played out at the end, when one country, Brazil, held up progress at the talks on one issue for a couple of days.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable image of this meeting was that of 15-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThis teenager who has organised school strikes in Sweden held daily press conferences here to drive home her message that platitudes and warm words just aren't enough anymore.\n\nHer message was sharp and succinct.\n\n\"We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "What chance has Nasa of finding life on Mars?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46563144", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Drive with Nasa's next Mars rover through Jezero Crater\n\nIt could be easier to detect the signs of ancient life on Mars than it is on Earth, say scientists connected with Nasa's next rover mission.\n\nThe six-wheeled robot is due to touch down on the Red Planet in 2021 with the specific aim of trying to identify evidence of past biology.\n\nIt will be searching for clues in rocks that are perhaps 3.9 billion years old.\n\nConfirming life on Earth at that age is tough enough, but Mars may have better preservation, say the researchers.\n\nIt comes down to the dynamic processes on our home world that constantly churn and recycle rocks - processes that can erase life's traces but which shut down on the Red Planet early in its history.\n\n\"We don't believe, for example, that Mars had plate tectonics in the way Earth has had for most of its history,\" said Ken Williford from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California.\n\n\"Most of Earth's rock record has been destroyed by subduction under the ocean crust.

But there\u2019s one particular thing I never quite seem to get around to, and I simply can\u2019t neglect it any longer. So this is it, I\u2019ve decided. This is the year I will, at long last, burn down your home.\n\nNo more excuses. I\u2019m going to do it this time.

I\u2019ve been planning this since that chilly day nine years ago when you bought me for $5 from a stranger on Craigslist.

For God\u2019s sake, do you want me to turn this house into a funeral pyre?\n\nMy only real regret about going up in flames is that I won\u2019t live to see the look on your dumb face as the fire engulfs you in a purifying heat, or hear the wailing sirens and the shouts of those arriving on the scene to find nothing but charred remains. Yes, I, too, will die in this luminous blaze, but my death will be a noble one.

I am able to pick up on the finer points and ask follow-up questions that get me nearer to the story. But this time round, I didn't understand a word, because my interviewees were speaking in Quechua - one of the main indigenous languages in Peru.\n\nI was speaking to Clodomiro Landeo and Marisol Mesa, presenters of the news show 'Nuqanchik', which means \"us\" in the Quechua language. 'Nuqanchik' has been broadcasting in Quechua for the past year. The show is part of a drive on Peru's public TV channel to counter the racist consequences of colonial representational power.\n\nWhen it comes to representation on the public stage, Peru's indigenous populations are, at best, fetishised, commodified, orientalised. At worst, they are spoken about, spoken for, spoken at - even laughed at. But there are signs that this could be changing, albeit at a snail's pace.\n\nThis week, a comedy show called 'La Paisana Jacinta' (Jacinta, the Peasant), which had been ridiculing indigenous women for years, was taken off air and off line, after a judge ruled in favour of a group of indigenous women from Cuzco who had accused the show of violating their human rights.\n\nThe ruling was welcomed by indigenous groups around Peru. However, there is a long way to go when it comes to achieving political and economic equality in historically meaningful ways. Ever since the arrival of the Spanish five centuries ago, the Peruvian state has been oligarchical and racist. The tension between Western and indigenous culture exists at the heart of the country to this day.\n\nWhen Nuqanchik goes to air at 5:30am every morning, it does more than just broadcast in a different language - the intention is to reflect a different reality, a perspective that isn't mainstream in Peru.\n\n\"Just because the programme is in Quechua, it doesn't mean we are going to just see folk music and dance. These are important and valuable aspects of that culture, but its fundamental purpose is to address people's needs,\" says media anthropologist, Raul Castro.\n\nThe question is whether newscasts will have a political impact? What will they change for the millions of indigenous people? Beyond exulting the indigenous rights to education, information, culture - will this kind of public broadcasting create a truly democratic space in which to rectify the material premises of their oppression?\n\nTo echo Peru's most famous journalist, Jose Carlos Maritegui, who was writing about Peruvian class structure and the oppression of the Quechua-speaking Indian in the 1920s: \"We are not satisfied to assert the Indian's right to education, culture, progress, love, and heaven.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Partial US Government Shutdown Looms", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-america-shutdown/4703688.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "A quarter of U.S. government operations could shut down Friday at midnight unless the White House and lawmakers agree on a new spending plan, including whether to fund President Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to thwart illegal immigration.\n\nSpending for three-fourths of the government has already been approved through next September, but the remaining bills include 2019 funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and possible money for the wall, a favorite Trump campaign vow while campaigning for the presidency in 2016.\n\nBut the $5 billion down payment Trump wants for the $20 billion wall is adamantly opposed by Democrats and some Republicans, leaving its fate in doubt.

Washington has been urging Islamabad to use its influence to bring the insurgents to the negotiating table.\n\nPakistani officials say their influence over the Taliban has significantly declined over the years because the insurgents have gained control over large areas of Afghanistan and continue to pose serious battlefield challenges for U.S.-backed Afghan security forces.\n\nThe United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan 17 years ago and the war with the Taliban has since killed nearly 150,000 people, including Afghan civilians, security forces, insurgents and more than 2,400 American soldiers, according to an American University study released recently\n\nThe longest war effort in U.S. history has also cost Washington nearly one trillion dollars.

With Mexico adamantly opposed to paying it, Trump has asked Congress for U.S. taxpayer funding, but has met with uniform disdain from Democrats and some Republican opposition as well.\n\nMiller called the dispute over wall funding, \"a very fundamental issue.\"\n\n\"At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country,\" he said.\n\nMiller contended, \"The Democrat party has a simple choice, they can either choose to fight for America's working class or to promote illegal immigration. You can't do both.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, who along with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, sparred with Trump over the wall at a White House meeting last week, said, \"He is not going to get the wall in any form.\"\n\nSome Republicans have suggested the impasse over wall funding could be broken by approving more money for other forms of security along the border, but Trump has yet to say whether that would be acceptable."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Climate Change Fuels Innovation in Kenya", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4703647.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nWith the impact of climate change an increasingly pressing global issue, a new generation of start-ups in Kenya is developing new technologies to combat global warming.

Many patients who receive interferon alpha experience extreme fatigue during treatment, and some continue to feel chronic fatigue for many months after the drug course is completed.\n\nRussell's team used this knowledge and measured fatigue and immune system markers in 55 patients before, during and after treatment with interferon alpha.\n\nThey found that the 18 of those 55 who went on to develop a CFS-like illness had a hyperactive immune system before treatment, and an highly overactive response during treatment. \"(This suggests) people who have an exaggerated immune response to a trigger may be more at risk of developing CFS,\u201d Russell told reporters at a briefing about the findings.\n\nIoPPN professor Carmine Pariante stressed that while the study's main finding is a useful addition to scant scientific knowledge about CFS - also known as myalgic encephalopathy (ME) - it offers few clues on how to treat, cure or prevent it.\n\n\"It's a light in the fog,\" he told reporters. \"But a better understanding of the biology underlying the development of CFS is needed to help patients.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Research Looks at Natural Fertilizer for Greener Agriculture, Cleaner Water", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/recycling-urine-as-fertilizer-cuts-waste-cleans-water/4702701.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "Fertilizer is made of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

The friend, who shared the text messages with The Associated Press on Friday, isn\u2019t sure if she ever did.\n\n\u201cI was concerned,\u201d Papenheim\u2019s friend, Adam Pryor, said about receiving that text on Dec. 6. \u201cShe said she was going to the police. ... It didn\u2019t feel like she was in danger.\u201d\n\nPapenheim, a native of Minnesota, was stabbed Wednesday at her apartment near Erasmus University in the port city of Rotterdam, where she had been studying since 2016. Police tried unsuccessfully to revive her after arriving at her home following reports of an argument.\n\nA 23-year-old man was arrested the same day at a railway station in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven. His identity has not been released, but on Friday, he appeared before an investigating judge in a closed hearing and was ordered detained for two more weeks while the investigation continues.\n\nIn her Dec. 6 text messages to Pryor, Papenheim was unhappy and was venting about working full time and attending school full time. She then said: \u201cMy roommate told me hes gonna kill 3 people. So im gonna have to go to the police.\u201d\n\nAP Photo/Mike Corder Tributes are placed on a table in an apartment block in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on Friday Dec. 14, 2018, where American student Sarah Papenheim lived. Papenheim, a 21-year-old psychology student at Erasmus University, was fatally stabbed at her home on Wednesday.\n\nPapenheim\u2019s mother, Donee Odegard, told the Star Tribune in Minneapolis that the suspect arrested was her daughter\u2019s roommate and that he reportedly had been \u201cgetting more and more angry\u201d in recent weeks.\n\nOdegard said her daughter was studying psychology with a focus on suicide; Sarah\u2019s brother took his own life three years ago. Amid concerns about the suspect\u2019s mental health, Odegard told her daughter: \u201d\u2018Get out of there,\u2019 but she wouldn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d she told the Star Tribune.\n\nPapenheim was a drummer in the Minneapolis blues scene. Pryor, a 19-year-old keyboardist, said he and Papenheim met at a jam session a few years ago and immediately connected because of their young ages and love of music.\n\n\u201cMost people my age don\u2019t know what blues music is, much less can play it and much less can play like she did,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just so special in so many ways.\u201d\n\nPryor said Papenheim was naturally gifted and had book smarts and street smarts, and the death of her brother was always on her mind. Pryor said Papenheim also had a big heart and tried to help everyone she could. She loved the Minneapolis music scene and it hurt her to be away from it.\n\nPryor recalled one moment last summer when the two were at a show at a Minneapolis venue. Papenheim was called on stage to play with some of the biggest names in town, and although she was nervous, \u201cshe went up there and just nailed it.\u201d Pryor said that was a big moment for Papenheim, who was shaking with excitement afterward.\n\nPryor, who studies electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Papenheim\u2019s slaying hasn\u2019t really hit him yet, but when he tries to listen to music, memories of her come flooding back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this is real.\u201d\n\nIn Rotterdam, tributes including flowers and candles were left inside Papenheim\u2019s apartment building. Erasmus University said it was shocked by her death and expressed condolences to her family and friends.\n\nFikret Egemen, the owner of a kebab restaurant where Papenheim worked part time, fought back tears as he recalled how she immediately fit into his team when she started working for him in September.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, she picked up everything. She was like family,\u201d he said. \u201cShe always worked with a smile, all day long, no problem. Angel.\u201d\n\nThe Star Tribune reported that musicians are planning a concert to help fund the repatriation of Papenheim\u2019s body.

A seat belt can\u2019t guarantee your child\u2019s safety in 100 percent of accidents. But would you ever not buckle them in?\n\nIt\u2019s about trying to prevent the worst, she says. Flu vaccines are typically 40 to 60 percent effective, but when they work, they can \u2014 like seat belts \u2014 potentially mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not perfect \u2015 but we know it is going to significantly reduce our risk of hospitalization and death and also our chance of illness,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people get hung up on that vaccine effectiveness number, but if you don\u2019t get the vaccine, you have zero protection against the flu.\u201d\n\nShe speaks from painful experience: Her son Joseph died during the 2009 swine flu pandemic after coming down with H1N1 before the H1N1 flu vaccine was on the market that year. The last thing they talked about was what he wanted to wear for Halloween.\n\nMuch More Than \u201cJust A Bad Cold\u201d\n\nThe flu, and its vaccine, are often underestimated, Dr. Lynnette Brammer, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s domestic flu surveillance team, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cI think people don\u2019t always really realize how severe influenza can be,\u201d she said, citing how many don\u2019t believe her that 80,000 people died in the U.S. alone last year \u2015 they think it\u2019s a global statistic. \u201cA lot of people think flu is just a bad cold.\u201d\n\nAmong that 80,000 figure are the 185 kids who died of the flu. It was the deadliest nonpandemic year on record since the CDC started tracking pediatric flu deaths in 2004. So far this year, six children have died.\n\nOf the kids who die from flu, the majority have no underlying health problems, American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Dr. Geoffrey Simon pointed out.\n\nBut when it comes to the vaccine \u2015 the single most powerful tool in preventing the flu \u2015 questions about its efficacy lead many to eschew getting it all together. Less than half of American adults get vaccinated each year. And an even lower proportion \u2015 under 4 in 10 \u2015 got their flu shot last year, which may have contributed to the high rate of cases and deaths.\n\nWhich is a mistake, Brammer says.\n\n\u201cWe would all love to have a vaccine that works better, but the vaccine that we have does provide protection,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even if you get sick, it may protect you from having more severe illness.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s particularly true for children, said Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatric infectious disease at the Baylor College of Medicine. She pointed to a study that shows a reduced risk of death in vaccinated children without underlying conditions.\n\nBut Munoz-Rivas acknowledged how hard it is to ensure kids are vaccinated each year \u2015 parents have to pull kids from school or add this to their to-do list on the weekend. And since there\u2019s no nationwide mandate for kids to get the flu vaccine in order to attend school as there is with other vaccination regimens, it doesn\u2019t always happen. There are exceptions: Connecticut and New Jersey require the flu vaccine for school attendance, while Ohio, Rhode Island and New York City also require it for child care.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 stance is that every child 6 months and older should get immunized.\n\n\u201cWe want it as easy as possible for families to protect their children,\u201d said Simon.\n\nFlu Season Is Far From Over\n\nExperts have been heartened by the preliminary news coming from CVS \u2015 a top flu shot distributor \u2015 which tells HuffPost that it\u2019s seeing a large uptick in flu shots since this time last year.\n\nBut some parents decide that if they\u2019ve missed the push for vaccination in October and before Thanksgiving, then it\u2019s too late and not worth worrying about anymore.\n\nWhile so far this year the flu\u2019s seasonal activity has been muted, there\u2019s a long way to go, Simon said, warning that a pickup is beginning now in December and peaks are usually expected in January and the spring.\n\n\u201cI tell parents it\u2019s never too late to get the flu vaccine,\u201d he said, stressing \u201cthe sooner, the better,\u201d considering it takes about two weeks to fully kick in.

Tisch Center for Women\u2019s Health at NYU Langone. \u201cAnd truly, if you think you have a heart attack, you need to call 911 and not waste time going online to check your symptoms.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Goldberg\u2019s patients. A study released this week by the European Society of Cardiology found that women having a heart attack wait approximately 37 minutes longer than men before contacting medical services. Researchers performed the retrospective analysis on 4,360 patients \u2014 20 percent of whom were women \u2014 treated at Triemli Hospital in Switzerland from 2000 to 2016. (The study did not find that the delay was associated with higher rates of death.)\n\nOne of the reasons women wait longer to call for help is that they don\u2019t know that heart attack symptoms for women are sometimes different from men\u2019s, according to the study\u2019s author and experts interviewed by HuffPost after its release.\n\n\u201cMen often get crushing chest pain. It\u2019s kind of clear. They\u2019ll call for help or go to the ER,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital who works with the American Heart Association\u2019s Go Red for Women initiative. It\u2019s possible for women to experience the classic chest-clutching, arm-numbing signs of heart attack, but sometimes they\u2019re far less obvious. \u201cWomen\u2019s symptoms could be more subtle, like shortness of breath or jaw pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, even flu-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nSigns can also include throat, neck, chest, stomach or shoulder pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes and cold sweat, dizziness and weakness.\n\n\u201cThe subtleties of these symptoms sometimes lead women to believe maybe they will feel better soon or it\u2019s going to pass, and they don\u2019t reach out for help,\u201d Steinbaum added.\n\nGoldberg said women might hesitate because they\u2019re worried about looking silly if they show up at the hospital and aren\u2019t having a heart attack. But she and Steinbaum agree that the risk is far too high to ignore the symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe head of my fellowship program used to say, \u2018Remember, time is muscle,\u2019\u201d Steinbaum said. \u201cThe longer you wait, the higher the chance of damaging a bigger part of your heart, and if that happens, the greater chance of really becoming quite sick with heart failure or death.\u201d\n\nThe subtleties of these symptoms sometimes lead women to believe maybe they will feel better soon or it\u2019s going to pass, and they don\u2019t reach out for help.\" Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine\n\nDespite the fact that heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, heart disease has been historically perceived as a man\u2019s disease and has been studied and treated as such.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that women don\u2019t have heart attacks,\u201d said Goldberg. It\u2019s that they differ in women, presenting differently and often later in life. \u201cThe most common time for [women] to have them is about 10 years after menopause, whereas in men, the prime time to have a heart attack is their 40s and 50s.\u201d\n\nHeart attack rates are rising among people ages 35 to 54 \u2015 and those rates are rising faster among women.\n\nAbout 80 percent of cardiovascular disease can be prevented. That is why it\u2019s important to raise awareness about heart disease in women, its prevalence and how it differs from heart disease in men \u2014 not just among patients but among members of the medical and research community as well, where women\u2019s needs aren\u2019t getting the attention they should.\n\nA Women\u2019s Disease Too\n\nDuring her residency, Goldberg once heard a doctor say women don\u2019t get heart disease. Then in 1990 a female patient came in with what she suspected were symptoms of a heart attack. While other doctors told the patient she was likely just stressed, Goldberg wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\nAfter a stress test came back abnormal, she persuaded the patient\u2019s doctors to do further cardiac testing. The patient was found to have a 99 percent blockage in a major heart artery \u2015 on the precipice one of the deadliest types of heart attacks there is.\n\nGoldberg said a lot of advances have been made since then but more has to be done to dispel the myth that heart disease affects mostly men.\n\nGender disparities in diagnosis and treatment are still considered a significant issue. A study published by the American Heart Association in February found that when women sought medical care for heart attack symptoms, 53 percent of the time, their health care providers did not believe their symptoms were health related. That\u2019s compared with 37 percent of men who were told the same thing.\n\nIn August a report from Stony Brook University in New York found that women having a heart attack waited 20 percent longer than men did from the moment they arrived at the hospital to when they began to receive care. That month another study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, showed that women are more likely to survive a heart attack if their cardiologist is a woman.\n\nZinkevych via Getty Images Heart attack symptoms in women can include throat, neck, chest, stomach or shoulder pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s become important to understand there are studies that have shown that doctors have really not been as proactive about taking care of their women patients compared to their male patients when it comes to heart disease \u2015 whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re not as aware or perhaps because there is an unconscious gender bias to it,\u201d Steinbaum said.\n\n\u201cI would like to believe in the medical world, [bias] doesn\u2019t exist, but the problem is we are all human beings,\u201d she added.\n\nPart of the problem, Goldberg said, is a lack of female cardiologists, who have thus far led the way when it comes to researching and raising awareness of heart disease in women.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the movement on cardiovascular disease in women has been led by women who are cardiologists,\u201d she said. But \u201cwe make up only 12.5 percent of the board-certified cardiologists in our country. And I think our male colleagues have to also get involved.\u201d\n\nGiving women the knowledge and language to communicate their symptoms is an important way to overcome possible bias, Goldberg and Steinbaum stressed.\n\n\u201cWomen themselves, they\u2019re not educated about the symptoms. They\u2019re not really good advocates for themselves to even go and say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure, but I might be having a heart issue,\u2019\u201d Steinbaum said. \u201cI think personal advocacy becomes a very, very important part of this.\u201d\n\nThe Knowledge Gap\n\nSteinbaum said the conversation around heart disease began to shift in 1984, when more women began dying of the disease than men.\n\nBefore then, \u201call heart disease research was done on men,\u201d she added. \u201cWomen were just not part of those trials and certainly not part of the major preventive trials. So we\u2019ve gone from not having women in trials to now beginning to study women\u2019s hearts and realizing there is a fundamental difference [between women and men], and we are learning.\u201d\n\nFor instance, it is known that conditions such as diabetes, lack of exercise and cigarette smoking increase both men\u2019s and women\u2019s risk for heart attack. But research has revealed that there are others conditions, including gestational diabetes and autoimmune disease, that can increase the risk of heart disease specifically for women, according to Goldberg.\n\n\u201cA lot of the movement on cardiovascular disease in women has been led by women who are cardiologists. ... I think our male colleagues have to also get involved.\u201d Dr. Nieca Goldber, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine\n\nBoth cardiologists said to learn more about the unique issues in heart disease among women, more research must be done regarding prevention, risk factors, and treatment. Steinbaum said this includes having women represented in clinical trials for pharmaceuticals and devices that are used in treatment and surgery. \u201cWomen\u2019s participation in research studies is only about 20 percent,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nIt\u2019s especially low among black women, who are disproportionately affected by strokes. Almost 50 percent of African-American women ages 20 or older have some form of cardiovascular disease. But Steinbaum said they get less care and are less likely to be involved in clinical trials than white women.\n\n\u201cUnless we have women represented in clinical trials, we won\u2019t have enough information about treatment and diagnosis for women in heart disease,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nNeither she or Steinbaum knows why so few participate in clinical trials, but they hypothesize that at least part of it is that many women are still the primary caretakers for their families and are too busy juggling work, children and more to participate in trials that are time-consuming.\n\n\u201cWe have to make research easier for potential individuals to engage in and give them a better understanding about participation in research and how it will drive important changes in health care in women,\u201d Goldberg said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

But it rarely lasts this long \u2014 more than a year \u2014 and scientists say this one, which has killed off significant numbers of fish, sea turtles, manatees and dolphins, has been powered in part by a toxic freshwater blue-green algae bloom in Lake Okeechobee. The blue-green algae, which grows when stagnant warm waters get nutrients from runoff agricultural fertilizers, flowed down the Caloosahatchee River into the Gulf of Mexico, where it mixed with red tide.\n\nIn the 1970s, scientists studied the effect of red tide on stone crabs and found little to worry about, said Dr. Ryan L. Gandy, the lead crab research biologist at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \u201cIt was always assumed that stone crabs survived red tides pretty well, and usually there wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d\n\nBut no one had looked into the effect of prolonged exposure to the toxic algae, which consumes oxygen at night, depriving the sea life below. Stone crabs, which are small and less adept swimmers than blue crabs, use their relatively large claws to scuttle along the ocean floor away from the red tide, and they can survive short periods without oxygen in the water, Dr. Gandy said.\n\n\u201cBut when it\u2019s prolonged day after day, it begins to weaken them,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year, Dr. Philip Gravinese, a crustacean researcher at the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Sarasota, exposed stone crabs to the toxic algae for an extended period and found that not only did their mortality increase, but also that high concentrations of the algae also killed off crab larvae."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "title": "Ryan Zinke, Face of Trump Environmental Rollbacks, Is Leaving Interior Department", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/ryan-zinke-interior-secretary.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Trump had tolerated the seemingly endless drips of scandal surrounding Mr. Zinke in part because he liked him personally and in part because his focus on the cabinet was concentrated on his desire to oust Mr. Sessions.\n\nAt the same time, though, Mr. Trump disliked the bad press that was amassing for Mr. Zinke, given how it reflected on him personally.

This may be the case, for example, if a drug has no direct competitors, so doctors cannot prescribe an alternative, or if the market for a drug outside Medicare is small."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Mapping the Brain\u2019s Genetic Landscape", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/health/genetics-brain-autism-schizophrenia.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s really interesting about psychiatric disease is that it\u2019s more heritable than many other diseases, \u201d Dr. Gerstein said. \u201cBut people don\u2019t have any clue about mechanisms between the underlying gene variants\u201d and the symptoms, for disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. \u201cNow, we\u2019re starting to fill that in.\u201d\n\nIn another report, investigators delivered a clearer picture of brain development over the human lifetime. The brain is continually adapting, or \u201crewiring,\u201d itself through life, particularly in utero and through adolescence, generating an ever-transforming genetic, cellular and genetic landscape that had defied the tools of modern science.\n\nA research team led by Nenad Sestan, another brain scientist at Yale, analyzed cells from tissue samples from 16 locations in the brains of dozens of people of all ages. The brains were collected post-mortem, and about half were from people who had been diagnosed with a disorder. The 16 brain regions correspond to areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, thought to be affected by problems like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nThe team tracked changes in the activity of genes and other molecular processes in those cells, looking for patterns that correlated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or autism. It identified a network of genes active in specific cell types \u2014 genes that were apparently communicating with one another \u2014 at about the stage in life when disorders begin to surface. Working backward, the researchers could trace the network pattern to specific cell types, biological activity and timing, as if reconstructing the how and when of a crime scene.\n\n\u201cHaving this insight will help us establish some potential causes and what they mean for neuropsychiatric disorders, and create new, testable hypotheses,\u201d Dr. Sestan said.\n\nThe result from all this work is a computer model for brain genomics that scientists can search \u2014 a database akin to Google Earth that charts specific genetic addresses in the brain and reveals which genetic and biological processes are active there, and at what point during maturation.\n\nDr. Matthew State, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author on two of the papers, said: \u201cEssentially what these papers do is lay out cellular and molecular landscape at a resolution that\u2019s never existed before. I see it as foundational work, and an investment that will pay off in giving us a far richer context to develop new hypotheses and study these disorders.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "N.I.H. to Scrutinize Private Donations to Scientific Research Projects", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/health/nih-alcohol-study.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-17 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Six months after halting a study of moderate drinking that was underwritten by donations from the alcohol industry, the National Institutes of Health outlined a series of steps to prevent similar conflicts of interest and to safeguard the integrity of its research and its reputation.\n\nIn a report issued on Thursday, N.I.H. officials said its 27 institutes must evaluate all current research projects that receive private donor support for conflicts of interest of the kind that compromised the alcohol trial.
