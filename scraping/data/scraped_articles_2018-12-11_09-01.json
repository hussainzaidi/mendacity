In fact, things are likely to get more chaotic and threaten consequential economic turbulence in 2019.\n\nIn the United States, the Trump presidency itself is under criminal suspicion as Robert Mueller's probe threatens to consume all of the White House's attention next year and undermine the political certainty that is the foundation of strong markets.\n\nEach of these contained political dramas are distinct. But European leaders are wrestling with the kinds of revolts from voters who felt they were economically and political disenfranchised by globalization and vowed to tear up establishment political systems.\n\nThose are similar political forces that helped Trump exploit dissatisfaction among rural, Midwestern and conservative voters in 2016.\n\n\"When you look at what is happening, you mention Macron, Brexit and think about the state of US politics -- that populist revolt we think that is real, it's powerful and it's only just beginning,\" Jared Woodward, global investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch told CNN International's Richard Quest Monday.\n\n\"Until policymakers change those policies so that Main Street catches up to the gains in Wall Street, we think you can expect more of these kinds of results,\" he said.\n\nFlashing economic warnings signs\n\nJUST WATCHED Congress races against government shutdown clock Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Congress races against government shutdown clock 05:27\n\nPolitical unrest is coming at a time of flashing red warning signs about the state of the global economy and could become problem for Trump if they develop into a genuine slowdown.\n\nAdverse economic news could have dire political consequences for Trump as he heads into his re-election since his best argument for a second term is the robust US economy that has produced the lowest unemployment figures for 50 years.\n\nThe President's handling of the economy is one of the few areas he ever approaches a majority of support in opinion polls. In a Quinnipiac University survey last month for instance, 53% of voters approved of his economic management and only 41% backed his performance overall.\n\nThose numbers, and the fact that Trump made the reinvigoration of the economy in post-industrial states in the Midwest the key to his campaign in 2016 explain why he may be especially vulnerable if the economy slows.\n\nThe blame game\n\nTrump has already seems worried, jabbing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and reportedly expressing disappointment with his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe US President appears most concerned by the fact that the Fed, along with other global central banks has continued a tightening policy even as fears of a global economic downturn grow.\n\n\"Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates,\" Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month, adding that Powell \"almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates.\"\n\nGiven how much Trump has to lose from the instability wracking the rest of the world, it is perhaps counter-productive that he is rooting for revolts that he clearly believes are in the image of his own anti-elite political movement even when they threaten other allied leaders.\n\nHe took a weekend shot at Macron months after they hugged at a Washington summit, as the French President was forced to back down on a fuel tax increase designed to fight global warming that sparked the worst rioting in Paris for decades.\n\n\"The Paris Agreement isn't working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nVery sad day & night in Paris. Maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2018\n\nMacron, under fierce political pressure was forced to address the French people on Monday, promising a rise in the minimum wage and the scrapping of new taxes on pensions.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly undercut May's tortuous effort to navigate Britain's exit from the EU, most recently contradicting her claims that she could negotiate a trade deal with the US under the terms of her exit deal.\n\nAnd his antipathy for Merkel, played out in several awkward photo ops and in tweets and speeches that criticized her policies on immigration, is well known.\n\nSo it's ironic that some of Trump's future political fate may hang on the capacity of such leaders to restore calm in their countries and the stability that could help the global economy and markets through a nervous period."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump sees impeachment as a 'real possibility,' source says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/qB2ey22RF-8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump has expressed concern that he could be impeached when Democrats take over the House, a source close to the President told CNN Monday.

He and Trump huddled several times over the last week in the residence of the White House, where they were afforded more privacy than in the staff-filled West Wing, but they ultimately could not agree to terms and Ayers declined the job.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with Trump's mood told CNN he's frustrated with the Ayers process.

Friday's filings by federal prosecutors backed President Donald Trump into a corner. And his Monday morning rage-tweeting indicates he may be beginning to grasp his limited options moving forward.\n\nThis anger is an understandable reaction. In every direction, shame and loss await him.\n\nHere's why. Trump could now face prosecution for criminal offenses should he lose the election and leave office in January 2021 -- if not sooner. More specifically, Trump was implicated by prosecutors in several felonies, namely campaign finance offenses stemming from the pre-election hush-money payoffs to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels\n\nAs charges against Michael Cohen indicated , the $150,000 payment to McDougal was an illegal corporate contribution, which Cohen caused a magazine publisher to make to the Trump presidential campaign. Corporations are barred from making any direct campaign contributions; they are only permitted to spend money independently. And the $130,000 payment to Daniels was an unlawfully excessive contribution made by Cohen to the campaign, as it was above the individual limit of $2,700. Both payments, prosecutors allege, were made at the direction of Trump himself.\n\nFortunately for Trump, there is a deal to be made. However, his stubborn refusal to show weakness and cut his losses might result in a criminal trial and future prison sentence for the 45th President.\n\nFirst, some context: On Friday, federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York recommended a \"substantial term of imprisonment\" for Trump's personal attorney Cohen, given his \"extensive, deliberate, and serious\" criminal conduct.\n\nYes, this is new, even if it sounds familiar. While Cohen had implicated his boss in a court statement he made under oath this summer, the allegations from Friday are more detailed and have much greater weight. In their Cohen sentencing memo, the SDNY prosecutors pointed a finger at Trump (referred to as \"Individual-1\"), stating that : \"With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments. In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1. As a result of Cohen's actions, neither woman spoke to the press prior to the election.\"\n\nThe words, \"as Cohen himself has now admitted,\" are a clue , according to former federal prosecutor Mimi Rocah that the government has other evidence beyond Cohen's testimony. \"They knew before Cohen admitted it.\"\n\nWhether indicted as a direct violator of the Federal Election Campaign Act, aiding and abetting it, or conspiring to violate it, Trump could face a prison sentence. For the campaign finance law, the statute of limitations is five years from the date of the offense, so that would be fall 2021. However, for conspiracy, the clock starts running when the last overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy takes place. This could allow for a potentially later indictment.\n\nThere are additional related potential charges that should concern the President. As Walter Shaub, former director of the US Office of Government Ethics has noted in a CNN appearance , Trump omitted from his June 2017 financial disclosure his debts to Cohen (in connection with the payment to Daniels). If done knowingly and willfully, this could be a felony for prosecutors to consider under the false statements statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n\nAssuming federal prosecutors follow departmental policy and choose not to indict a sitting president, they would still have time to charge him if he loses the election in 2020 and exits the presidency in January 2021. If Trump is indicted while President (with the trial deferred until after his term ends), the statute of limitations could toll. This is like pausing a stopwatch. That way, if re-elected for a second term, the clock would start up again, and he could await a trial after departing in 2025.\n\nYet there is building support from legal scholars, including Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe, condemning the Department of Justice policy and contending that the Constitution does not prohibit indicting Trump even while in office. Tribe recently tweeted : \"I just don't get it. If Trump shot someone, he'd be indicted in a New York minute. Nothing in the Constitution prevents his indictment for directing a criminal conspiracy to steal the presidency. Certainly not a DOJ 'policy.'\"\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhat this all means, is, even if not indicted now, Trump has a big gamble ahead. He can hope he wins in 2020. But if he does not, a criminal trial most likely awaits him on the other side. His other choice would be to try to negotiate a resignation before it's too late, and hope for a full pardon for all federal crimes from Mike Pence, who would step in as President. This is not a guarantee, though. With political ambition of his own, depending upon the President's poll numbers, Pence might stand firm.\n\nTrump might even attempt to pardon himself. But, again, this is a huge risk. When he leaves office, he could then be charged with obstruction (which also has a five-year statute of limitations ) -- and such a conviction would also make that pardon worthless.\n\nIn short, Individual-1 is in a pickle.\n\nFor now, we should expect Trump to continue to rail against the Mueller investigation and related spinoffs, and even if some portion of his more than 56 million Twitter followers are sympathetic, that does not matter. There are only a dozen people who matter: the jurors selected for his potential future criminal trial."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Beyonce performs at pre-wedding party for daughter of India's richest man", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/YOoe_WJYFzU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN Contributors Swati Gupta, CNN\n\nChartered jets arriving in Udaipur for Indian heiress Isha Ambani's wedding contributed to a four-fold increase in flight traffic at the city's airport Saturday.

He said Meng would be closely monitored and would personally cover all the related security costs.\n\nBut the Canadian judge who will rule on Meng's bail seemed to cast doubt Monday on the arrangements pitched by Martin.\n\nThe judge expressed skepticism that Meng's husband can act as a surety, or the primary person responsible for making sure she complies with all the orders set forth by the court, since he is not a permanent Canadian resident.\n\nMeng, 46, is a high-profile executive at one of China's best-known tech companies.

But this is the fullest account of the transcript that has so far been published.\n\nIt is likely to increase pressure on the Trump administration, which has been determined to separate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from the murder, and sought to frame the issue as a binary choice between supporting or cutting off a key partner in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump has been at odds with the CIA, which, sources say, has concluded bin Salman personally ordered the killing.\n\nThe revelations also threaten to undermine a key plank of an initial Saudi explanation for Khashoggi's death, that it was a rogue operation that went horribly wrong.\n\nThe original transcript of the audio was prepared by Turkish intelligence services . Turkish officials have never said how they obtained the audio. The transcript would have been translated before it was shared with other intelligence services; CNN's source read a translated version and has been briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe office of one US senator, who has received a briefing on the investigation by CIA Director Gina Haspel, told CNN that the source's recollections of the transcript are \"consistent\" with that briefing.\n\nCNN asked Saudi officials to comment on the contents of the transcript as described by the source, and to provide comment from those named in it. A Saudi official said: \"The relevant Saudi security officials have reviewed the transcript and tape materials through Turkish security channels and nowhere in them is there any reference or indication of a call being made.\"\n\n\"If there is additional information Turkish authorities have that we are unaware of, we would welcome it being officially handed over to us for review, which we have requested numerous times and are still requesting. And, up until now; we have not received anything.\" The official did not address the transcript's characterization of the scene inside the Saudi consulate, nor Khashoggi's last words.\n\nA security camera image shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\n'You are coming back'\n\nThe transcript begins at the moment Khashoggi enters the Saudi consulate in a quiet residential district of Istanbul at lunchtime on October 2.\n\nKhashoggi thought he had made a routine appointment to pick up papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. But, according to the source, it dawns upon Khashoggi almost immediately that things are not going to plan, when he recognizes one of the men who meets him.\n\nHe asks the man what he is doing there.\n\nAccording to CNN's source, a voice identified in the transcript as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a former Saudi diplomat and intelligence official working for bin Salman, and known to Khashoggi from their time together at the Saudi Embassy in London, addresses him.\n\n\"You are coming back,\" the man says.\n\n\"You can't do that,\" Khashoggi replies. \"People are waiting outside.\"\n\n(Khashoggi's fianc\ufffd\ufffde accompanied him as far as the consulate, with instructions to call associates if he did not emerge.)\n\nWithout any further dialogue, according to the source, the transcript indicates that several people set upon Khashoggi.\n\nNoises follow, and very quickly Khashoggi is fighting for air.\n\nIn one version of the evolving explanations for his death, Saudi officials suggested Khashoggi was accidentally choked. But according to the transcript, CNN's source says, the journalist's voice can be heard above the noise, repeatedly claiming he could not breathe.\n\nDespite his desperate pleas, the last discernible words the transcript records for Khashoggi are:\n\n\"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThe transcript notes more noises, and several more voices.\n\nOne of those voices is identified on the transcript by Turkish authorities as belonging to Dr. Salah Muhammad al-Tubaiqi, the head of forensic medicine at Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, the source says.\n\nAside from Khashoggi and Mutreb, he is the only other voice identified by name on the transcript.\n\nAs the transcript continues, it is clear Khashoggi is not yet dead.\n\nThe transcript notes the noises that can be heard on the tape, almost in the manner that subtitles describe moments in movies where there is no dialogue.\n\n\"Scream.\"\n\n\"Scream.\"\n\n\"Gasping.\"\n\nThen, the transcript notes other descriptions.\n\n\"Saw.\"\n\n\"Cutting.\"\n\nTubaiqi is noted giving some advice to other people in the room, apparently to help them deal with the appalling task.\n\n\"Put your earphones in, or listen to music like me.\"\n\nDuring the scene, the transcript notes at least three phone calls placed by Mutreb.\n\nThe transcript does not specify the moment Khashoggi dies.\n\nAccording to the source, the transcript suggests Mutreb is updating someone, whom Turkish officials say was in Riyadh, with almost step-by-step details of what is taking place.\n\n\"Tell yours, the thing is done, it's done.\"\n\nThe word \"yours\" is taken by CNN's source to refer to a superior, or boss.\n\nThe transcript has been circulated to key Turkish and Saudi allies , including those in Europe, but only the United States and Saudi Arabia have received the recording itself, the source believes.\n\nThe working assumption among those allies is that Mutreb was talking to Saud al-Qahtani, bin Salman's closest aide, the source said. Saudi officials say al-Qahtani has been removed from his former position as media chief to the crown prince.\n\nThe transcript only records Mutreb's side of the conversation. Without a recording of that call, or more details of which number was called, further conclusions based on the transcript alone cannot be made.\n\nA portrait of Jamal Khashoggi during a remembrance ceremony for him in Washington on November 2.\n\nA source close to the Saudi investigation into Khashoggi's killing told CNN that Mutreb and Tubaiqi deny making any phone calls.\n\nCNN has previously reported how Mutreb, Tubaiqi and 13 other Saudis arrived in Istanbul by private charter jets and commercial aircraft on the day of and the days leading up to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nTurkish surveillance video records the 15-man hit team arriving at the consulate shortly before Khashoggi, and departing a few hours later. A body double of Khashoggi dressed in Khashoggi's clothes is seen on CCTV leaving by the back door.\n\nIt is clear from the transcript of the phone conversation that the calls do not describe a terrible situation gone awry, or explain an unexpected set of circumstances, the source says. Instead, the caller appears simply to be informing someone of what is going on. Hardly, the source says, the actions of a panicked ringleader, but more the description of a situation going entirely according to plan.\n\nThe transcript is relatively short, given the time span it describes, the source told CNN. There is not much dialogue; certainly no hint of a conversation about why Khashoggi should go \"back,\" and no suggestion either, as advanced at one point by Saudi officials, that he had been drugged by the hit team.\n\nThere is nothing in this transcript that the source could describe as a \"smoking gun\" -- a snippet of conversation or phone call that directly ties bin Salman to the so-called hit team, and to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham on Khashoggi: Crown Prince 'complicit' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham on Khashoggi: Crown Prince 'complicit' 02:00\n\nBut the lasting conclusion the source drew from the transcript is that Khashoggi's killing was a planned assassination by an organized team that carried out its job with ruthless efficiency, keeping someone in Riyadh informed at each step.\n\nWhile the transcript provides no smoking gun directly tying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the killing, it seems to echo Sen. Lindsey Graham's sentiments after hearing the CIA's assessment of Khashoggi's killing.\n\nGraham, who was among a group of senators to receive a classified briefing on the Khashoggi case, said earlier this week that he agreed with the conclusions of the US security services that bin Salman was implicated in the case.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Flights canceled and power out after Southeast storm", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/ZP_hUIsEEZs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The brunt of the storm may have passed, but North Carolina residents still face perilous conditions after record-setting snow walloped the state.\n\n\"With a mix of snow, ice and rain still coming down in some areas, conditions remain treacherous in many parts of our state,\" Gov.

Herdman, US attorney for the Northern District of Ohio.\n\n\"It's not just one threat. It's across the spectrum,\" Herdman told CNN in an interview on Monday. \"It's not just Islamic or anarchist or animal rights terrorism. It's everything.\"\n\nInvestigators became aware of Joseph after they noticed pictures of knives and firearms on his social media accounts, court records show. FBI agents posing as members of ISIS began a monthslong conversation with Joseph in which he offered his services in creating propaganda videos, court records show.\n\nJoseph would routinely talk online with undercover agents who he thought were members of ISIS, the records show. The conversations ranged from details about his propaganda videos to his beliefs, and he admitted he struggled with the idea of killing but was not afraid to go to prison, since he would be able to recruit fellow inmates. Then in September, the agents asked Joseph if he hated people in America. \"Oh yeah, definitely,\" answered Joseph, according to court records. \"The gays the Christians the Catholics the Jews you name it.\"\n\nUndercover agents later met Joseph in person and were given a shopping list of weapons and ammunition, items he needed to mimic the October Tree of Life shooting , where 11 people were killed, Herdman said. On his list was an assault rifle, semi-automatic pistol, at least two magazines and ammunition, according to the indictment.\n\nBy the time Joseph met with undercover agents on Friday, they said, he had fine-tuned his plot. Joseph had narrowed his plot to one synagogue and showed one of the agents pictures from inside the structure, saying he wanted to start the killing spree in the sanctuary, records show. Joseph, who also wanted to make sure he killed a rabbi, said he was going to raid the synagogue on the Sabbath so he would cause maximum bloodshed, records show.\n\nLater that day, agents sold Joseph two inoperable AR-15's and that is when they took him into custody, records show.\n\n\"This guy is one firearm away from another Tree of Life shooting.

She then decided to target a livestock farm and wanted to form a team, officials said, before changing course again and saying she and her roommate planned to make a pipe bomb and were gathering materials.\n\nEarlier this month, Lecron told an undercover agent she was considering a pipeline in Georgia. She agreed to buy black powder needed to make the bomb and had bought hundreds of screws, intended to be used as shrapnel in the blast, at a sporting goods store on Saturday, records show.\n\nInformation on Lecron's attorney was not immediately released.\n\n\"The longer these people are in place on the street the greater the risk is that they're going to kill somebody,\" Herdman said. \"It was just the right time to take them down.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Florida school pulls assignment that asked whether Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz should die", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/WHPWmyXntZ8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Parkland high school massacre is a sensitive subject anywhere, but it's especially so in South Florida schools near where the shooting occurred.\n\nThat may explain why one high school, a 10-minute drive from the scene of the massacre, ditched an assignment for students that explored the shooting in what some consider a tone-deaf way.\n\nCoral Glades High School pulled a quiz Friday entitled \"Does Nikolas Cruz Deserve to Die?\" The quiz was based on material from an article with the same title in the October edition of The New York Times Upfront magazine, a publication for high school students by Scholastic Inc. and the newspaper.

The Mercer County Sheriff's office confirmed to CNN that Headley has an outstanding arrest warrant from NJ Superior Court from July 2017 for failure to appear in relation to credit card fraud.\n\nNYPD officers pried a 1-year-old child from his mother's arms in a disturbing video that is now under review.\n\nThe incident began on Friday just before 1 p.m. when police responded to a harassment complaint at the Fort Greene Food Stamp Center in Brooklyn.\n\nPolice were called after office staff and HRA security unsuccessfully tried to remove Headley from the facility \"due to her disorderly conduct towards others, and for obstructing the hallway,\" according to police.\n\nFacebook user Monae Sinclair, who posted the video, said that there were no chairs available so Headley sat in the corner on the floor. A security guard came over and exchanged words with her, and the police later arrived.\n\nHeadley was told by police numerous times to leave the location and refused, the NYPD said. HRA security then brought the woman to the floor and NYPD officers attempted to place her under arrest, the NYPD said.\n\n\"She refused to comply with officers' orders, and was then taken into custody,\" police said in a statement.\n\nThe video illustrates in graphic clarity the show of force implicit in that police statement. Headley refused medical treatment for both herself and her son, police said. There were no officer injuries in the incident.\n\nLisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, said Headley was there because her child-care benefit, which allowed her to maintain her job, had ended. She took a day off work to come to the social services office and try to resolve the issue and get her child back in daycare, Schreibersdorf said.\n\nHeadley arrived at 9 a.m. and waited at the office for four hours. She was asked to move from her spot on the floor multiple times, Schreibersdorf said, but there were no seats available.\n\nSecurity then decided to call police, a step that Schreibersdorf and Adams said was an unnecessary escalation. Responding police escalated the scene even further by using the child as a \"pawn\" and pulling him out of his mother's arms, Schreibersdorf said.\n\nShe said it was \"absurd\" that Headley was charged with endangering her child in the incident. And she said that the district attorney asked for and the judge issued a full order of protection, which means that Headley cannot see her child right now.\n\n\"The escalation of this not only points out something very disturbing about the police and police solutions to these incidences, but it also highlights how one decision on the police to arrest somebody can actually really fan out and create so many consequences for this family,\" she said.\n\nComparison to Trump's separation policy\n\nAdams compared the incident to the separation of migrant families at the US-Mexico border.\n\n\"This is a blemish on our entire city. Anytime our well-trained police officers cannot de-escalate a situation between mother and child without looking like Border Patrol police snatching away babies and children, that says that we're not doing what we need to do correctly,\" Adams said.\n\nAdams added that the incident was particularly unfair because many of the people at that office are already struggling.\n\n\"This is supposed to be a place where families come to regain their dignity and respect, and not have it ripped from us,\" he said.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said this was a disturbing incident.\n\n\"Like anyone who's watched this video, I have a lot of questions about how this was handled,\" he said. \"NYPD & HRA will get to the bottom of what happened.\"\n\nCorey Johnson, the speaker of the New York City Council, said the incident was \"unacceptable, appalling and heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"I'd like to understand what transpired and how these officers or the NYPD justifies this.

One source described his mood as \"super pissed.\" A second added he feels humiliated, a position he doesn't like to be in, because the President did not have a backup candidate prepared like he typically does when he's fielding people for jobs.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "GOP shrugs at Trump's involvement in Cohen payments", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/0WTF6VJEmbo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday was implicated by prosecutors in two crimes committed by his former attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nBut Republicans are mostly shrugging their shoulders.\n\nDemocrats are suggesting Trump committed an impeachable offense and could be sent to prison in the aftermath of Friday's filing from the US Attorney's office in Manhattan, in which federal prosecutors said for the first time that Trump directed Cohen when Cohen committed crimes by paying women for their silence about alleged affairs. Republicans on Monday, however, downplayed the possible danger for Trump when asked about the new allegations, questioning whether Cohen's story was credible and saying they wanted to reserve judgment until all of the facts come out from special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, the retiring Utah Republican and most-senior GOP senator, strongly dismissed the federal government's allegations that Trump committed two crimes by directing Cohen to make the hush money payments.\n\nAsked if he had any concerns that Trump was implicated, Hatch told CNN: \"The Democrats will do anything to hurt this President.\" Informed it was alleged by federal prosecutors in New York, Hatch said: \"OK, but I don't care, all I can say is he's doing a good job as President.\"\n\nHatch added, \"You're talking about things that happened before he became president.\"\n\nOther senators questioned whether the allegations from Cohen that Trump was involved were credible, given the source was a known liar. Trump on Saturday denied that he directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\n\"As long as Cohen's a liar, I shouldn't give much credibility to what he says,\" said outgoing Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who will run the Finance Committee next year.\n\nCohen first made the allegation in court in September that he was directed by Trump to make the payments to the two women. But prosecutors endorsed the allegation in a sentencing document for Cohen on Friday, in which they said Cohen should receive a \"substantial sentence\" for the crimes he committed, which included campaign finance violations for the payments to the two women, tax fraud and lying to Congress.\n\nGrassley said that the federal prosecutors got their \"information from a liar.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, questioned both that prosecutors would rely on Cohen's information and also that the allegations had strayed from the original Russia collusion investigation from the special counsel.\n\n\"Jesus loves him, but everybody else thinks he's an idiot,\" Kennedy told reporters. \"He's obviously a sleaze-oid grifter. And if I were a prosecutor, I wouldn't base a prosecution on evidence given to me by Mr. Cohen.\"\n\n\"Look I'm not minimizing it, this campaign finance act is important,\" Kennedy added. \"But No. 1, it's a long way from collusion with a foreign agent to influence the election in 2016, which is what I thought this was about. No. 2, Campaign Finance Act violations are, generally, civil matters.\" He noted sometimes they are also criminal cases, such as the unsuccessful prosecution of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and has spent ample time investigating the Clinton email controversy, said that the federal probe would limit his ability to look into the Cohen scandal.\n\n\"I'm not sure how we would even get that information,\" he said when asked if his panel would examine Trump's involvement in the hush-money scheme.\n\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, who will be the No. 2 Senate Republican next year, said it was \"premature\" to judge how the Cohen developments would impact the broader investigation and Trump.\n\n\"I mean, until we know all the details -- it's a sentencing filing,\" Thune said. \"I'm sure there's going to be a lot more come out from the Southern District (of New York) and, at some point, from the Mueller investigation as well.

Butina's case was brought by federal prosecutors in DC and not by Robert Mueller's team in the special counsel's office.\n\nHer cooperation will mainly focus on telling investigators about the role of her boyfriend Paul Erickson and her interactions with her Russian handlers. A spokesman for the US Attorney's office in DC declined to comment. Butina's lawyer declined to comment for the story. A lawyer for Erickson also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the agreement, revealed to CNN, Butina \"agreed and conspired, with a Russian government official ('Russian Official') and at least one other person, for Butina to act in the United States under the direction of Russian Official without prior notification to the Attorney General.\"\n\nABC News was first to report Butina agreed to cooperate.\n\nA plea hearing has been set for 3:15 p.m. Wednesday where a judge will need to sign off on the deal. The developments on Monday come after several weeks of hints that Butina might negotiate an end to her case -- and after bumps in the case where federal prosecutors, at the height of attention on Russia's influence in American politics, accused the former graduate student of infiltrating Republican organizations in order to advance Russian interests.\n\nUntil now, Butina, 30, maintained her innocence and insisted she was simply a foreign student interested in bettering relations between the US and Russia. Butina previously pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy and a second count of acting as an agent of a foreign government when she was arrested in July.\n\nPlea deal detailed\n\nThe draft filing of the plea deal notes that Butina relied on assistance from Erickson and took direction from her handler -- former Russian banker Alexander Torshin -- as she \"sought to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over US politics. Butina sought to use those unofficial lines of communication for the benefit of the Russia Federation.\"\n\nNeither Erickson or Torshin is identified by name in the draft but their details make them identifiable based on previously known information.\n\nButina kept Torshin apprised of her activities and her \"assessment of the political landscape in the United States in advance of the 2016 election,\" according to the draft filing.\n\nAt one point, Torshin asked her to provide a note justifying his attendance at the 2016 NRA national meeting. Butina \"did as he directed, encouraging his attendance partly because of the opportunity to meet political candidates,\" according to the document.\n\nEven though the draft court filing takes pains to outline her efforts to make inroads in conservative political circles, it also waters down other allegations prosecutors made in court.\n\nAfter previously casting her studies at American University as little more than a cover, the draft statement of offense notes: \"All available evidence indicates that Butina had interest in a graduate school education.\"\n\nThere's no mention of the sex-for-access allegations prosecutors once laid out in court filings -- only to them walk back later.\n\nButina's plea offer indicates she will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy, according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n\nProsecutors estimated a sentence between zero and six months. Butina has already been incarcerated for five months, so the judge could decide to sentence her to time already served.\n\nHer cooperation agreement calls for her to turn over any evidence of crimes she is aware of, submit a full accounting of her financial assets, sit for interviews with law enforcement (and waive right to counsel during those interviews) and testify before grand juries or in trials in DC or elsewhere.\n\nIt also notes that, due to her plea, she will likely be deported.\n\nA politically charged case\n\nHer case first became public amid a furor of US-Russia developments. She was arrested two days after the Justice Department separately indicted Russian military intelligence for hacking the Democratic Party, and her case became public the same day President Donald Trump met with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declined to endorse US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nButina's case at first appeared to allege she attempted to do just that -- with prosecutors suggesting she offered sex to gain political access and sought out Trump campaign officials. But prosecutors later admitted they made an error in interpreting the text messages they used as evidence to support their claim that she was trading sex for access, drawing a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case.\n\nAt a bail hearing in July, in which a judge determined she should be jailed to avoid her fleeing to Russia with the help of Russian diplomats, her attorney argued that her case shouldn't be a proxy fight for US-Russian relations.\n\nIt is still unclear if Butina fits into a broader picture of investigations into Russian infiltration in US politics, however, or if she will agree to cooperate in other federal investigations as part of her plea deal.\n\nPrior to her arrest, Butina signaled she would be willing to cooperate with investigators on other probes, such as a fraud investigation in South Dakota into Erickson, who is an American conservative activist. Immediately after her arrest, she became unwilling to help.\n\nProsecutors in their criminal complaint accused Butina of ingratiating herself with politically powerful Americans and groups, including the NRA, and exploiting those connections to try to advance Russian interests. They alleged she was in regular contact with her Russian backers, including Torshin, a Kremlin-linked banker who has been sanctioned by the US Treasury and that she made contact with Russian intelligence. At one court hearing, prosecutors showed a photo of her dining with a Russian diplomat just north of the embassy just before that man, a suspected intelligence officer, left the US amid a purge of Russian agents.\n\nProsecutors said Torshin compared her to Anna Chapman, another accused Russian spy who was deported from the US in a prisoner swap in 2010, and that she tried to establish \"back channel\" lines of communications with American politicians and met Republican leaders as \"a representative of informal diplomacy\" before the 2016 election.\n\nThe contacts with Americans involved in politics lasted throughout her tenure as a graduate student at American University, according to prosecutors. They had cast her studies as little more than a cover for her spy work.\n\nBy changing her plea, Butina will likely be forced to return to Russia upon release from jail. She is currently being held in solitary confinement in a northern Virginia jail. She and her lawyer have repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, argued that she should be released on house arrest or at least moved out of solitary confinement.\n\nEven under scrutiny from federal investigators, Erickson has continued to visit Butina in jail. He has not been charged with a crime.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "44 former US senators urge current Senate to defend democracy in op-ed", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/fwq7tRNyTZo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Forty-four former Republican and Democratic US senators penned an op-ed for The Washington Post that warns \"we are entering a dangerous period\" and urges current and future senators to be \"steadfast and zealous guardians of our democracy.\"\n\nThe former senators write in the op-ed they feel an \"obligation to speak up about serious challenges to the rule of law, the Constitution, our governing institutions and our national security.\"\n\n\"We are on the eve of the conclusion of special counsel Robert S.

MUST WATCH Breast cancer in young women 00:59\n\nNone of the women had breast cancer when they were enrolled in the studies, which involved data from several European countries, the United States and Australia.\n\nThe data showed that, compared with women who had not given birth, women with children had an elevated breast cancer risk that peaked around five years after childbirth and continued for about 20 years -- regardless of whether women breastfed or not.\n\nThe researchers then noticed that this difference in risk among women who had had children and women who hadn't shifted about 23.6 years after childbirth.\n\n\"That's actually the point at which we started to not see much of a difference between the women who had a child and women who had not had children,\" Nichols said. \"As you went further out from there, then the benefits of having children started to emerge.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that, even though breastfeeding did not appear to influence the findings, other factors did, including the age at which a woman first gave birth, how many children she had and whether she had a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\"One of the things that we want our study to be able to do is to contribute to new tools that will help predict breast cancer risk more effectively for young women -- so women who might be trying to decide with their providers when to start having mammogram screenings,\" Nichols said.\n\n\"In order to have a good tool to do that prediction, we need to know how risk factors operate in young women, and it's becoming increasingly clear that we can't take the information or the patterns we see in older women and apply them to younger women and assume they'll be the same,\" she said.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that any breast cancer diagnoses during pregnancy in the data were not uniformly distinguishable from diagnoses made during early postpartum.\n\nAlso, the study was unable to explore the biological mechanisms behind why an association between breast cancer risk and childbirth even exists, but Nichols offered some ideas.\n\n\"What could be happening is that pregnancy is a time when there is rapid development of the breast tissue, and the cells in the breast are rapidly dividing, and we know that when tissue is expanding quickly that there's more potential for an error to occur within a cell or an error that's already there in the cell to have multiple copies made of it,\" Nichols said.\n\n\"So we don't think it's actually anything about pregnancy that's causing breast cancer. We think that it's possible that this rapid expansion of the breast tissue might make it easier for cancer cells to either grow or be started,\" she said, but more research is needed.\n\n'This data should not be used to influence decisions about childbearing'\n\nThough there is no clear explanation for this increase in breast cancer risk, young women should be aware of the small risk -- and that it can last for more than 20 years, especially if the woman is older during her first birth, has had several pregnancies or has a family history of breast cancer, said Dr. Francisco Esteva, medical oncologist at NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"At the same time, screening mammograms are not generally recommended in women younger than 40 years of age,\" he said. \"Therefore, if these results are confirmed, we would need novel approaches to identify breast cancer early in younger women, especially after childbirth.\"\n\nStill, women also should know that the study findings should not influence their decision-making regarding having children, said Dr. Erica Mayer, a medical oncologist and clinical investigator in the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Deciding when to get pregnant, or whether or not to get pregnant, can be an intensely personal decision. This data should not be used to influence decisions about childbearing, as the cancer risks observed are overall fairly modest, as well as on a large population level, and it's difficult to extrapolate these risks to an individual person,\" Mayer said.\n\n\"However, evaluating personal cancer risk in a premenopausal woman is important,\" she said. \"If a woman has a history that may influence risk -- such as a family history of breast cancer -- then she should discuss with her doctor the timing of initiation of mammographic screening, as well as whether referral to a genetic counselor would be helpful to evaluate for a genetic risk of breast cancer.\"\n\nOverall, the study found what has been seen in previous research, Mayer said.\n\n\"It's known that pregnancy at a younger age may confer some long-term protective benefits against breast cancer, however it's also been recognized that in the immediate years following a pregnancy, there seems to be an increased risk of breast cancer that slowly resolves with time,\" she said. \"The findings in this paper support and confirm the prior observations.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Nichols and colleagues' results add to a large body of evidence demonstrating a transient increase in breast cancer risk after childbirth.

Because of these restrictions, these tests miss as many patients with hereditary cancers as they find, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\n\"Unfortunately, insurance companies pay attention to these guidelines,\" said Dr. Peter Beitsch , co-author of the study and a cancer surgeon practicing in Texas. Insurance companies and other payers reimburse genetic testing -- or not -- based on the guidelines.\n\nThe result: Patients without genetic test results might not receive the appropriate treatment for their cancer, which could be a matter of life or death.\n\nApproximately 330,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States and of these cases, an estimated 10% are likely due to hereditary causes, according to Beitsch.\n\nThe guidelines are two decades old\n\nThe guidelines for the genetic testing of breast cancer patients were established about 20 years ago by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network , a nonprofit alliance of 28 cancer centers dedicated to improving patient care, explained Beitsch, who is a co-founder of the TME Breast Care Network, a nonprofit focused exclusively on advancing treatment for breast cancer patients.\n\n\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said. \"Back then we tested for two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA 2 ,\" said Beitsch. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are tumor suppressor genes that everyone has; if a defect or mutation occurs in one or both of these genes, the likelihood of breast cancer is increased.\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said.\n\nSince then it has become known that 11 \"major\" gene mutations, including BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, can cause breast cancer, while 25 or 30 other genetic variants are also linked to the disease, said Beitsch.\n\nMeanwhile, genetic testing \"radically changed. It went from a difficult-to-do, and expensive, test to a quite inexpensive test,\" said Beitsch. \"The cost dropped from, say, $5,000 for two genes to now we're doing 80 genes for about $250.\"\n\nWhile the guidelines also evolved, they \"got incredibly complicated,\" he said: \"unusable.\"\n\nSo Beitsch and his colleagues set up a study to look at nearly a thousand female breast cancer patients, half who met the criteria set forth in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the other half who did not. Among 959 study participants, all underwent a full panel of DNA testing for hereditary breast cancer.\n\nThe results showed that 83 women or 8.65% of the total participants, had breast cancer-linked genetic defects. Of these, 45 women met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria for testing, while 38 women did not. Ordinarily, then, these 38 women would not have been tested.\n\nGenetic testing may be a matter of life or death\n\nMany women who have breast cancer do not meet the criteria under the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, said Beitsch, and this affects their treatment and, potentially, their survival.\n\nDr. Otis Brawley , a professor in the department of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Emory University School of Medicine, explained that when a patient with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation is diagnosed, \"We treat them differently from a person with no known mutation.\" For example, surgical decisions and the use of chemotherapy might be based on whether a woman has a genetic mutation.\n\n\"Over the past 20 years we are learning of a number of genes that can have a mutation. Some change our treatment,\" said Brawley, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nGenetic testing, then, is not only important to a patient's survival, Beitsch said, \"but also for her family members as well.\" Carrying the same genetic mutation, a female relative may be at increased risk for breast cancer, while male relatives may be at increased risk for prostate and other cancers.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said that \"it's a misconception that men cannot be impacted by BRCA genes and it's a misconception that they cannot pass them onto their children.\"\n\n\"There's no question we don't test the people we know should be tested,\" including some patients with a \"family history that has cancer written all over it. Unfortunately, too many professionals don't pay attention,\" said Lichtenfeld, who did not contribute to the new research. One study, for example, suggests that fewer than one in five people who meet National Cancer Comprehensive Network criteria and have a history of breast cancer have actually undergone genetic testing.\n\n\"Then there's the group of people without a family history who want to get tested,\" he said.\n\nWill we all be routinely tested in the future?\n\npeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test. 2016 survey suggests that more than half -- 56% -- of American adults would be interested in taking a genetic test that indicated the likelihood of their developing cancer. The 30 to 64 age group had the highest proportion of willingpeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test.\n\nDespite public interest and increasing knowledge of potential causes of cancer, insurance plans do not routinely cover the expense of medical genetic testing, said Lichtenfeld. And barriers exist even for those who most need to know the results of such tests, such as some women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, he said: \"Once [a woman] is diagnosed, unless she has a family history, a lot of payers, including Medicare, will not pay for the test.\"\n\nSome patients pay for the testing on their own, but this is not possible for all patients. And some patients may be unaware of the need for medical genetic tests because the guidelines do not recommend they get it.\n\nSince genetic tests are now relatively inexpensive, the reason for creating an \"economic roadblock\" no longer exists, Beitsch said, and so the guidelines should \"be wiped.\"\n\n\"The guidelines really don't help -- in fact, they hurt, they injure, they keep people who could benefit from genetic testing from getting it,\" said Beitsch, who hopes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network will recognize his study \"and take heed of it and hopefully change the guidelines.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLichtenfeld said cancer centers \"are finding many more people who have a hereditary basis for their cancer than would have been suspected based on our previous knowledge.\" Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, scientists have become increasingly adept at reading the mysterious code and what \"we don't understand today, we will understand tomorrow or next year or in the next decade,\" said Lichtenfeld. He believes that soon, genetic testing will be routine for newborns.\n\nBased on his new research, Beitsch cherishes a more modest hope that at the very least all breast cancer patients will be offered and reimbursed for genetic testing, and perhaps, the same for all cancer patients."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot for this mild season", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/02XttMre86w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot this season, according to a new survey from NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs of mid-November, only 43% of surveyed people 18 or older said they had gotten vaccinated against the flu, according to NORC, which has conducted the National Immunization Survey for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2005. Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health. Since the outbreak began, the total number of probable cases is now 471, including 273 deaths, the ministry reported Thursday .\n\nPublic health authorities are investigating an additional 106 suspected cases, the ministry indicated.\n\nSecond-largest outbreak in history\n\nThis is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the second this year. It is also now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.\n\nOn average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August, has a case fatality rate of 57%.\n\nThe ministry also reported that 149 people have recovered. However, 44 health workers have been infected with the virus, of whom 12 have died.\n\nNorth Kivu province, which includes the cities of Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province, according to the World Health Organization. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\n\"Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge,\" WHO said in a report Thursday.\n\nWHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.\n\nGender imbalance\n\nWomen and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thursday . To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.\n\nThe \"multitude of factors\" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.\n\n\"Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),\" WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.\n\nThe ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major clinical trial conducted during an outbreak in Guinea, according to WHO.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFresh guidance issued Thursday by the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies Working Group, an international team of 17 experts, seeks to ensure that pregnant women are no longer excluded from receiving vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.\n\nThe public health preparedness report, which offers concrete steps for equitably addressing the needs of pregnant women, includes 22 total recommendations. One is that during an epidemic, such as the current one, the default setting should be to offer vaccines to pregnant women, not the reverse.

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

The team is still working through the results, but the data indicates the seafloor in much of the bay dropped down in the quake.\n\nThis, combined with a sharp movement of the crust northwards, could certainly have produced a tsunami, the Indonesian scientist said.\n\n\"When we overlap the bathymetric data from before and after, we can see that almost all of the area of the seafloor inside the bay subsides. And from this data, we can also observe [the movement] to the north. So, actually, we have a vertical and a horizontal displacement,\" Udrekh Al Hanif told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright BPPT Image caption Looking south down the bay towards Palu: The seafloor dropped in response to the quake\n\nWhether this behaviour was enough on its own to explain the tsunami's size is still open to question.\n\nThere is evidence of several underwater landslides in the data. These, too, could have been a factor.\n\nAnother possibility is an upwards thrust of the seabed in a zone some distance from Palu where the strike-slip fault splits into diverging tracks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down\n\nMovement on both tracks at the same time might have compressed the crust in between.\n\n\"This was a very unusual event but the tectonics tell us it could happen again,\" said Finn L\u00f8vholt from the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute.\n\n\"Indeed, this is not the first time an event has happened in Palu. It's probably the third or fourth event that has caused many fatalities. We had events in the 1960s and 1920s.\"\n\nImage copyright Georgia Institute of Technology Image caption Damage has been scanned with lidar to better understand the movement of the water\n\nAnd this history is evidenced in the local culture where there are specific words to describe features of a tsunami and a quake. In the September event, Palu witnessed a lot of liquefaction, where the structure of soils in the city was seen to collapse, to become fluidised and flow even on very low gradients.\n\nHouses were consumed in the mud. Local people call this \"Nalodo\", which means something like \"buried in black\".\n\nHermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, said Palu demonstrated the challenge confronting the local population. \"This tsunami arrived very fast, within minutes,\" he stressed.\n\n\"That basically leaves no time for warnings. That's very different from Japan (in 2011) where there was an eternity of time - more than 30 minutes everywhere until the first person was killed by the tsunami. That's the challenge for these local tsunamis: people have to self-evacuate.\"\n\nWidjo Kongko, also from the BPPT, spoke of some complacency following an emergency drill conducted in Palu in 2012. \"It said go to high ground within 5-10 minutes. The people need to learn that the tsunami can come much, much quicker.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "East Antarctica's glaciers are stirring", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46517396", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Michael Studinger/Nasa/Icebridge Image caption East Antarctica has shown very little evidence of change over the decades\n\nNasa says it has detected the first signs of significant melting in a swathe of glaciers in East Antarctica.\n\nThe region has long been considered stable and unaffected by some of the more dramatic changes occurring elsewhere on the continent.\n\nBut satellites have now shown that ice streams running into the ocean along one-eighth of the eastern coastline have thinned and sped up.\n\nIf this trend continues, it has consequences for future sea levels.\n\nThere is enough ice in the drainage basins in this sector of Antarctica to raise the height of the global oceans by 28m - if it were all to melt out.\n\n\"That's the water equivalent to four Greenlands of ice,\" said Catherine Walker from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nThe glaciologist has been detailing her work here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The glaciers in Vincennes Bay have shown the biggest change in behaviour since 2008\n\nDr Walker has been making the most of a new initiative at the agency to process huge numbers of satellite images to get a more resolved and more timely view of what is happening in East Antarctica.\n\nPreviously, scientists had been aware that the region's Totten Glacier was experiencing melting, most probably as a result of its terminus being affronted by warm water coming up from the deep ocean. Pretty much everything else in that part of the continent was considered stagnant, however.\n\nThe new satellite elevation and velocity maps change this view. They make it clear that nearby glaciers to Totten are also starting to respond in a similar way.\n\nMarked change is detected in the Vincennes Bay and Denman areas just to the west, and in Porpoise Bay and on the George VI coast to the east.\n\nVincennes Bay - which includes the Underwood, Bond, Adams, and Vanderford glaciers - has the most pronounced loss in ice mass. Elevation is dropping at five times the rate it was in 2008 - with a total fall in height over the period of almost 3m.\n\n\"They've also sped up about 3% from their 2008 velocity, which sounds small but is significant enough to change the flux coming out of those glaciers because they are very deep,\" said Dr Walker.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Totten has long been recognised as the fastest moving glacier in East Antarctica\n\nOnce again the melting culprit is likely to be warm water that is being pulled up from the deep by shifting sea-ice and wind patterns in the region.\n\nThe changes that are occurring are still quite subtle, and they are only really discernible because of the new automated computer tools that will search through the millions of satellite images taken of Antarctica.\n\nNasa is about to widen access to these tools through a project called Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation, or ITS_LIVE.\n\n\"I think we can anticipate that over the next five to 10 years, we're going to have a lot of observationally driven discoveries, such as what Catherine is making, because of the new data that's coming online,\" said Alex Gardner, a glaciologist with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Amount of deep life on Earth quantified", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46502570", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bob Hazen: \"It opens the window to lifeforms we may not even be able to imagine\"\n\nScientists have estimated the total amount of life on Earth that exists below ground - and it is vast.\n\nYou would need a microscope to see this subterranean biosphere, however.\n\nIt is made up mostly of microbes, such as bacteria and their evolutionary cousins, the archaea.\n\nNonetheless, it represents a lot of carbon - about 15 to 23 billion tonnes of it. That is hundreds of times more carbon than is woven into all the humans on the planet.\n\n\"Something like 70% of the total number of microbes on Earth are below our feet,\" said Karen Lloyd from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, US.\n\n\"So, this changes our perception of where we find life on Earth, from mostly on the surface in things like trees and whales and dolphins, to most of it actually being underground,\" she told BBC News.\n\nProf Lloyd is part of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) project, a near-decade long effort to identify how the ubiquitous element is cycled through the Earth system.

That is almost twice the volume of all the oceans.\n\nBacteria and archaea (microbes with no membrane-bound nucleus) dominate. But there also eukarya (microbes or multicellular organisms with cells that contain a nucleus as well as membrane-bound organelles) down there, such as the tiny nematode worms discovered in rock cracks at the bottom of deep mines.\n\nScience has barely begun to describe this microscopic menagerie.\n\nImage copyright G Borgonie Image caption Scientists collect ancient water samples 1.3 km underground to test for their microbial content\n\nDeep microbes are often quite different to seemingly related species that thrive at the surface, with life cycles that operate on near-geologic timescales. And because these underground organisms persist far from sunlight they must exploit chemosynthesis - as opposed to photosynthesis - to nourish themselves. The minerals in the rocks around them are their larder.\n\nThe role all these organisms play in shifting carbon about the Earth is profound, according to the DCO's executive director, Bob Hazen.\n\n\"You cannot understand carbon on Earth without understanding the diversity and influence of life. Cells turn over carbon - they take carbon in, they breathe it out. They do amazing things to transform their local environments,\" he explained.\n\n\"Although the total amount of carbon in other sources is much, much larger than in life, life has a disproportionate affect on Earth's carbon cycle.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL-CALTECH/SSI Image caption Somewhere out there? Could other planets and moons have subterranean ecosystems?\n\nWhat are the implications of this research?\n\nAnother aspect of the research is what is says about the absolute limits of life on Earth in terms of temperature, pressure, and the availability of energy.\n\n\"The current known upper-limit for life is 122 degrees Celsius, which happens to be the temperature of sterilisation equipment we typically use in labs,\" said Dr Lloyd.\n\n\"But there's no-one I know who thinks that's the theoretical limit. For example, we know some of the problems associated with high temperatures, such as the disordering of lipids and membranes, is at least partially compensated by higher pressures. Which means it's possible we could find even higher temperature organisms the deeper we go down.\"\n\nAnd this has clear implications for the possibility that life exists somewhere else in the Solar System, adds Prof Colwell.\n\n\"I think it's probably reasonable to assume that the subsurface of other planets and their moons are habitable, especially since we've seen here on Earth that organisms can function far away from sunlight using the energy provided directly from the rocks deep underground,\" he told BBC News.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa's Voyager 2 probe 'leaves the Solar System'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46502820", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are both outside the heliosphere, a protective bubble created by the Sun that extends beyond the orbit of Pluto\n\nThe Voyager 2 probe, which left Earth in 1977, has become the second human-made object to leave our Solar System.\n\nIt was launched 16 days before its twin craft, Voyager 1, but that probe's faster trajectory meant that it was in \"the space between the stars\" six years before Voyager 2.\n\nThe news was revealed at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington.\n\nAnd chief scientist on the mission, Prof Edward Stone, confirmed it.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Voyager 2 launched 16 days before its twin, Voyager 1\n\nHe said both probes had now \"made it into interstellar space\" and that Voyager 2's date of departure from the Solar System was 5 November 2018.\n\nOn that date, the steady stream of particles emitted from the Sun that were being detected by the probe suddenly dipped. This indicated that it had crossed the \"heliopause\" - the term for the outer edge of the Sun's protective bubble of particles and magnetic field.\n\nAnd while its twin craft beat it to this boundary, the US space agency says that Voyager 2 has a working instrument aboard that will provide \"first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway into interstellar space\".\n\nThe probe's present location is some 18 billion km (11 billion miles) from Earth. It is moving at roughly 54,000km/h (34,000mph). Voyager 1 is further and faster still, at 22 billion km and 61,000km/h.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The probes were launched to explore the outer planets, but have just kept going\n\nDid the the team plan to explore beyond the Solar System?\n\nThe Voyagers were sent initially to study the outer planets, but then just kept on going.\n\nProf Stone said that at the start of the mission the team had no idea how long it would take them to reach the edge of the Sun's protective bubble, or heliosphere.\n\n\"We didn't know how large the bubble was, how long it would take to get there and if the space craft would last long enough,\" he added. \"Now we're studying the very local interstellar medium.\n\n\"It's a very exciting time in Voyager's 41 year journey.\"\n\nScientists define the Solar System in different ways, so Prof Stone has always been very careful not to use the exact phrase \"leave the Solar System\" in relation to his spacecraft. He is mindful that the Nasa probes still have to pass through the Oort cloud where there are comets gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit very loosely.\n\nBut both Voyagers certainly are in a new, unexplored domain of space.\n\nHow long has this journey taken?\n\nDecades and billions of kilometres. Voyager 1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager 2.\n\nThe pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989.\n\nThey were then steered towards deep space. It is expected that their plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their 20W transmitters will die.\n\nThe Voyager project manager, Suzanne Dodd told BBC News that she would like to see them both keep going until 2027.\n\n\"It would be super-exciting to have a 50-year mission still operating,\" she added, describing the probes as \"pioneers\" of interstellar space.\n\n\"Every so often they phone home and say - 'I'm still going.

For Spiti Lahaul, it is 34% - equivalent to about -5m/year per decade. These are glaciers that would normally move at tens of metres per year.\n\nImage copyright F.PAUL/NASA/USGS Image caption Landsat has built multi-decade records of glacier behaviour in Asia\n\nWhat was the key finding?\n\nPerhaps the major revelation is that the reduction in velocity is strongly correlated with thinning. Nyainq\u00eantanglha's glaciers have been thinning on average by about 60cm a year; Spiti Lahaul's glaciers are losing thickness at a rate of roughly 40cm a year.\n\n\"The reason a glacier flows is because of gravity,\" explained Dr Dehecq. \"Under its weight, the glacier slides across its bed and deforms, but as it thins it finds it more difficult to slide and deform; it's kind of intuitive.\n\n\"But until now there had been some debate as to whether other factors were influencing speed, such as the lubrication of the bed as a result of increased meltwater getting under the glacier. Well, we show thinning is actually the dominant factor,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAre some glaciers getting faster?\n\nThe slowdown trend is strongest in the south and southeast of High Mountain Asia; it is less pronounced in the West.\n\nRegions like the Karakorum in Pakistan, and Kunlun just across the border in Tibet/China, have actually shown a slight thickening over time and a marginal speed-up as a consequence.\n\n\"That's the influence of different climatic conditions,\" said co-author Dr Noel Gourmelen from Edinburgh University, UK. \"Precipitation in the East is affected by the Asian monsoon and in the West and North-West, it is delivered by westerlies; although it's not exactly clear why the Karakorum has been gaining mass.\"\n\nImage copyright shylendrahoode Image caption Galcier meltwaters ensure south Asia has a consistent supply of water, even in drought\n\nWhy is this research important?\n\nThe meltwater that flows from the 90,000 glaciers in High Mountain Asia is critical to the lives and livelihoods of the people downstream. But the significance goes much wider, because the snow and ice stored \"in the freezer\" at high altitude would otherwise push up global sea levels if it all melted and ran into the ocean. That is why scientists need to understand how the glaciers will respond in an ever-warming world.\n\nThis study, which has also been published in the journal Nature Geoscience, has described an important dynamic that will moderate how much ice is transported down mountains to the elevations where it can melt.\n\nComputer models that try to project the future resilience of the glaciers in what they call Earth's \"third pole\" must now take account of this behaviour.\n\nDr Hamish Pritchard from the British Antarctic Survey also studies these glaciers. He said their contribution to rivers across the region was small in the average year, but significantly heightened during years of drought.\n\n\"My research shows that when the summer rains fail, glacier melt comes to dominate water inputs to many catchments in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Without this water supply more crops would fail, substantially less hydropower would be generated and more people would be forced to migrate,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"These rivers that flow down from the mountains pass through many communities and across national borders, so when supplies are low, tensions between neighbouring communities and countries would likely increase.\n\n\"Studies show that this tension could lead to conflict, with implications far beyond South and Central Asia.\n\n\"The key role of these glaciers then is as a buffer against the worst effects of drought, and so the loss of glacier ice can be seen as a threat to the future stability of the region.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "John Kelly Out As Chief Of Staff", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/john-kelly-out-as-chief-of-staff-1830994917", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:08", "body_paragraphs": "Speaking Friday, President Trump confirmed John Kelly will be leaving as chief of staff by the end of the year after 18 months defined by an attempt at instilling discipline on an often chaotic administration.

Located deep in West Beirut, it was tucked between taller buildings that usually took the brunt of shell and mortar fire.\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1975 between right-wing Christian parties supported by Israel and the United States fighting left-wing Muslim groups allied with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Beirut's hotel district became a war zone. The warring factions vied to establish a foothold in the district's high-rise hotels which often offered snipers a vantage point and other fighters strategic positions to launch attacks.\n\nAs fighting intensified and each group claimed more territory, many international journalists covering the war ventured out from the Commodore to other parts of the city to report on the action. They'd return to the Commodore to file their stories using facilities made available by millionaire hotelier Yousef Nazzal.\n\nHailed as the 'godfather' of the international press, Nazzal's astute action and international connections allowed Beirut's Commodore to become a global centre for news and information.\n\nIf the Commodore had not been there, the Israeli invasion would not have been so well reported. Robert Fisk, former Times Middle East correspondent\n\n\"Yousef Nazzal was a young man then, and he seemed to have an extraordinary uncanny ability to know what journalists wanted and he realised quickly and brilliantly that journalists would need first of all, above all good communications,\" according to former BBC Middle East correspondent Tim Llewellyn, one of the Commodore's many patrons.\n\nNazzal already had lines and telex machines from his existing businesses but got hold of extra lines to accommodate reporters' demands. As the war spread and militias took control of different neighbourhoods, the challenge for the Commodore was to keep the hotel safe for its media guests.\n\n\"The Commodore Hotel was safe. And so you could be there and it's quite bizarre, you could be in a safe enclave and then you went out into a very grave civil war,\" says Jonathan Dimbleby, who went to Beirut as a young correspondent for ITV.\n\nBut life for the journalists staying at the Commodore was tough, especially under the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the 70-day siege of Beirut in 1982.\n\nThey, like others in West Beirut, were subject to Israel's indiscriminate shelling. But \"if the Commodore had not been there, the Israeli invasion would not have been so well reported,\" according to Robert Fisk, former Times Middle East correspondent, now with The Independent. He and other foreign journalists were able to get the real story out.\n\n\"The Beirut siege was an eye-opener for many correspondents who had only eaten the Israeli story until then.\"\n\nThe Commodore provided easier access to the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps and so journalists were able to witness first-hand the mass killing in the camps, perpetrated by Christian Phalangists and supported by Israel. Their reports caused a public relations nightmare for the then Israeli Minister of Defence Ariel Sharon.\n\nFollowing the Israeli withdrawal from Beirut in 1982, Christian and Muslim militias tussled for control of different Beirut districts, with the Commodore in the middle of the mayhem. Its safe haven status for journalists began to fall away, especially when the kidnappings began.\n\n\"The fear of kidnapping started around '84,\" says Fisk. \"I had an attempt of kidnapping me at Madame Curie street, very close to the Commodore. I certainly realised that it was the first time I started getting really frightened. And then of course not long afterwards Terry Anderson was kidnapped, the longest-held hostage for almost seven years, and then we all realised that we are in trouble.\"\n\nTerry Anderson was the senior Associated Press correspondent who was kidnapped on January 16, 1985 on his way to the Commodore Hotel.\n\nBy April 1986, 30 foreign nationals had been kidnapped in Lebanon, including Terry Waite, the special envoy to the British Archbishop of Canterbury, who was ironically on a mission to negotiate the release of hostages.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, most foreign reporters had pulled out of Beirut and the Commodore became yet another victim of the war.\n\nWhile the hotel has since been refurbished and revived, some will miss the old Commodore and the intrepid cast of characters that called it home.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Former Gambian President Yahya Jammeh blocked from entering US", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/gambian-president-yahya-jammeh-blocked-entering-181211064353455.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "The US State Department has barred former Gambian President Yahya Jammeh and members of his immediate family from entry into the United States.\n\nThe decision announced on Monday comes almost two years after Jammeh was forced into exile in Equatorial Guinea after he refused to concede defeat in a presidential election.\n\nJammeh ruled the tiny West African country for two decades.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

Cohen is due to be sentenced this week.\n\n\n\nMueller's office, meanwhile, detailed lies they say former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told them even after he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate.\n\n\n\nAnd prosecutors are preparing for the sentencing hearing next week of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who lied to the FBI about his Russian contacts.\n\n\n\nUnanswered Questions\n\n\n\n\u2014 Did the Trump campaign collude with Russia?\n\n\n\nThat remains unclear, though there is mounting evidence of direct contact throughout the campaign between Trump associates and Moscow and evidence that individuals in Trump's orbit were discussing a possible email dump from WikiLeaks before it occurred.\n\n\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies and Mueller have said Russia was the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the campaign that damaged Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential effort.\n\n\n\nAdditional ties between Russians and Trump aides were alleged within the last week. Prosecutors revealed that a Russian contacted Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" between Russia and the Republican campaign.

Although the charges don't directly touch Trump, he's nonetheless remained a figure of considerable intrigue and enjoys the continued sympathy of the president, who has left open the door for a pardon.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rick Gates: The longtime associate of Manafort and key Trump campaign aide was indicted last year alongside his mentor but months later split from him by pleading guilty to unregistered foreign lobbying work and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller. No sentencing date has been scheduled for Gates, indicating that his cooperation with investigators is continuing.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Michael Flynn: He has admitted lying to the FBI just days after Trump took office by telling agents that he had never discussed sanctions with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States. The White House said Flynn had misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the conversation and ousted him weeks later. He's since become a vital cooperator for Mueller, having met 19 times with investigators. Prosecutors aren't recommending any prison time when he's sentenced next week.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Michael Cohen: He's at the center of not only Mueller's investigation but also a separate investigation into hush-money payments. In Mueller's investigation, Cohen has admitted lying to Congress about a proposed real estate development in Moscow.

He also pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations stemming from the payments, with prosecutors saying he ``acted in coordination and at the direction of Individual-1'' \u2014 Trump.\n\n\n\n\u2014 George Papadopoulos: The former foreign policy adviser recently finished a 14-day prison sentence after admitting lying to the FBI about a 2016 conversation with a Maltese professor who told him Russia had \"dirt\" on Clinton in the form of emails.\n\n25 Russians\n\n\n\n\u2014 Twelve military intelligence officers were charged in July with hacking the email accounts of Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and then facilitating the release of tens of thousands of private communications. It remains perhaps the most direct example of what American intelligence officials say was a broad conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf.\n\n\n\nThat indictment did not accuse any Americans of participating in the conspiracy, though it did include an eye-catching detail: The Russian hackers, prosecutors say, made an attempt to break into Clinton's network just hours after Trump appeared to invite them to do so. In a July 27, 2016, speech, Trump urged Russia to look for emails that Clinton said she had deleted from her tenure as secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\"Russia, if you're listening,\" Trump said, \"I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 A separate indictment charges 13 Russians with using a covert social media propaganda campaign to sow discord among Americans in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors say the scheme was run by a Russia-based troll farm that relied on bogus social media postings and advertisements fraudulently purchased in the name of Americans to try to influence the election.\n\n\n\nOther Defendants\n\n\n\n\u2014 Konstantin Kilimnik: The Ukrainian native, who U.S. authorities say has ties to Russian intelligence, was indicted on obstruction of justice charges involving Manafort. The men are accused of trying to persuade two witnesses to lie about the nature of political consulting and lobbying work they carried out for Ukrainian interests.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Richard Pinedo: The California man was sentenced in October to six months in prison for unwittingly aiding the Russian troll farm by selling stolen identifications and bank account numbers that were used by Russians to establish PayPal accounts and purchase advertisements on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Alex van der Zwaan: The Dutch attorney became the first person punished with prison in the Mueller investigation when he was given a monthlong sentence for lying to investigators about his contacts with Gates and Kilimnik and about a report prepared by his law firm about the trial of a former Ukrainian prime minister.\n\n\n\nOther Names You May Have Heard\n\n\n\n\u2014 Roger Stone: The longtime Trump confidant and self-proclaimed \"dirty trickster\" of Republican politics has been under investigation for months as prosecutors try to establish what knowledge he may have had about plans by WikiLeaks to release the stolen Democratic emails in the weeks before the election. Although a 2016 Stone tweet \u2014 \"Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel\" \u2014 appeared to presage the disclosure of hacked emails, Stone has said he had no inside knowledge about the content, source or timing of WikiLeaks' disclosure.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Jerome Corsi: A conspiracy theorist and Stone friend, he's been under intense pressure from Mueller and even turned down a plea offer that would have required him to admit intentionally lying about a 2016 conversation he had with Stone about WikiLeaks. It's unclear when or if he will be indicted, but based on draft documents Corsi has released, prosecutors appear to believe that he misled them about email exchanges involving Assange and the purloined emails.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Julian Assange: Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia inadvertently disclosed the existence of a sealed criminal complaint against the WikiLeaks founder, though no details have been publicly announced. Assange, under Justice Department scrutiny for years for WikiLeaks' role in publishing government secrets, has been an important figure in the Mueller probe as investigators examine how WikiLeaks obtained the stolen emails and whether any Americans were involved in coordinating that effort.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Donald Trump Jr.: The president's eldest son has attracted scrutiny for his role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 \u2014 also attended by Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 at which he expected to receive damaging information on Clinton. He has said the meeting was a waste of time because he didn't receive anything interesting from the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya. Both he and his father have suggested that anyone in that position would have taken the meeting in hopes of getting dirt on a political opponent.

In enacting a federal law, he said, Congress overstepped.\n\nNow, local lawmakers, advocates and newspapers are calling for state bans that equal or surpass the scope of the federal law that was struck down.\n\n\u2018Never again\u2019\n\nThe case Friedman ruled on centers around Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, an emergency room physician accused of performing FGM on at least 100 girls in Michigan for more than a decade.\n\nProsecutors have focused their case on nine girls, aged 7 to 12, from three states. The girls allegedly were subjected to FGM with the aid of Nagarwala and seven others, including the girls\u2019 mothers.\n\nDefense attorneys say the procedure amounted to only a \u201cnick\u201d on the girls performed as part of a religious ritual \u2014 not FGM. But they also argued in July that the federal law banning FGM is unconstitutional.\n\nState Senator Rick Jones, who represents Michigan\u2019s 24th district, told VOA by phone that he was shocked to learn about Nagarwala\u2019s case and strongly disagrees with Friedman\u2019s ruling.\n\nLast year, Jones became the spokesperson for a package of bills outlawing FGM statewide. The legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n\nNow, Michigan has some of the toughest FGM laws in the country.\n\nHealth-care providers convicted of performing FGM face up to 15 years in prison, along with the permanent loss of their medical licenses. Parents who take their daughters to doctors to be cut can lose custody.\n\nThe 1996 federal law, meanwhile, stipulated up to five years in prison and fines for medical providers who perform FGM.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to send a strong message around the world: Never again bring your girls to Michigan for this horrible procedure,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAcross the U.S., 27 states have passed laws banning FGM, many of which have been written in recent years and include penalties that go beyond the federal law, which also criminalizes so-called \u201cvacation cutting,\u201d the practice of taking girls out of the United States to have FGM performed overseas.\n\nNews organizations are among those pushing for an expansion of state laws. Last month, the Seattle Times editorial board called for a ban in Washington, one of 23 states yet to outlaw FGM.\n\nEarlier this month, the Los Angeles Times editorial board said all 50 states should ban the \u201cbarbaric\u201d practice, in light of Friedman\u2019s ruling.\n\nReligious ritual?\n\nThe health-care providers and families involved in the Michigan case belong to Dawoodi Bohra, a Shi\u2019ite Muslim sect based in India with about 2 million followers worldwide.\n\nAccording to a study published earlier this year, FGM, called khafd in Dawoodi Bohra communities, is widespread in the sect and involves cutting the clitoral hood or part of the clitoris, without an anesthetic, when girls turn seven.\n\nThe study, commissioned by WeSpeakOut, an advocacy group focused on eradicating khafd, also found that three-quarters of Dawoodi Bohra women have experienced FGM.\n\nThe severity and nature of FGM can vary.\n\nHealth-care providers have identified four types of FGM. Khafd involves Type 1 FGM. Other types involve removing all of the external genitalia and narrowing the vaginal opening.\n\nJones rejects the idea that there\u2019s a religious basis for the procedure, however it\u2019s performed.\n\n\u201cAcross the world, this has been practiced by Christians, pagans, Muslims, even a small Jewish sect in Ethiopia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not about a religion,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is about men attempting to control women\u2019s behavior by this horrible procedure.\u201d\n\nThe WHO identifies both short-term and permanent harms associated with the practice. Immediate concerns include severe pain, infections and, in some cases, death. Long term, women and girls subjected to FGM face a range of physiological and psychological complications that can affect menstruation, childbirth and sexual health.\n\nThe United States has been unequivocal in condemning the practice, saying \u201cthe U.S. government considers FGM/C to be a serious human rights abuse, and a form of gender-based violence and child abuse\u201d on a fact sheet posted to the Citizenship & Immigration Services website.\n\nEducation and legislation\n\nFriedman\u2019s November decision is the latest in a series of setbacks for prosecutors.\n\nNagarwala spent seven months in 2017 in jail before 16 friends posted a $4.5 million unsecured bond, against the pleas of prosecutors, who argued Nagarwala could silence potential witnesses or even flee the country if released.\n\nAnd in January, the judge dismissed charges that Nagarwala and a second doctor, Fakhruddin Attar, transported minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, an offense that carries a lifetime sentence.\n\nNagarwala still faces conspiracy and obstruction charges that could result in decades in prison.\n\nThe trial is now set to begin next April, the Detroit Free Press reported last month. However, the prosecution could appeal last month\u2019s decision, drawing the case out further.\n\nLooking beyond the Michigan case, Jones said the key to stopping FGM isn\u2019t just legislation but also education.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is continue to fight this worldwide. This is a global problem,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cIt is a violation of human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to continue speaking out worldwide against this horrible, horrible practice that must end.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump, Lawmakers Scramble to Avoid Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lawmakers-scramble-to-avoid-shutdown/4694354.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Democratic leaders Tuesday in a final effort to secure border wall funding as part of a larger government spending package that must be passed by Dec. 21. The funding marks the final legislative action of the Republican-controlled Congress and a must-pass bill to avert a partial government shutdown ahead of the holidays.\n\n\n\nBoth parties face a delicate balancing act tackling the latest fight over immigration with just weeks until control of the House of Representatives shifts to Democrats.\n\nTrump will meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to see if there is room for compromise on his request for up to $5 billion in funding for the wall in fiscal year 2019. The meeting will be the first test of Trump\u2019s ability to negotiate bipartisan deals following significant Democratic gains in November\u2019s congressional midterm elections.\n\nTrump and Pelosi initially expressed interest in working with each other on bills addressing infrastructure and prescription drug prices. But Pelosi \u2014 who is expected to become Speaker of the House when the new Congress is sworn in next month \u2014 rejected the possibility of compromise on border wall funding.\n\nDemocrats consider a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u201cimmoral, ineffective and expensive,\u201d Pelosi told reporters Thursday. She also made clear Democrats would not link a compromise on the border wall with a legislative solution addressing the legal status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients, the more than 800,000 undocumented young people brought to the United States as children.\n\nCompromise on a solution for DACA recipients stalled in Congress throughout 2018. The House failed to pass a bill after a group of Republicans organized an effort to defy House Speaker Paul Ryan and force the issue.\n\nPelosi proposed lawmakers pass the six funding bills that have already cleared key committee votes while funding the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that would oversee the border wall funding, on another temporary spending measure.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the president is willing to accept that,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters Thursday.\n\nTrump says the border wall with Mexico will stop an invasion of migrants from Central America into the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cCould somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country loses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!\u201d Trump tweeted on Dec. 4.\n\n\n\nThe administration received $1.375 billion in funding for border security in the fiscal year budget that ended on Sept. 30. It did not include money for building a wall.\n\n\u201cThe idea that they haven\u2019t spent last year\u2019s money and they\u2019re demanding such a huge amount this year makes no sense at all,\u201d Schumer said.\n\n\n\nTrump and Republicans in a lame-duck Congress face a tough choice. Forcing the issue of the border wall will trigger a partial government shutdown just four days before Christmas.\n\n\n\nLawmakers will not relish the prospect of being trapped in Washington figuring out a solution. But some Republicans see the shutdown as an opportunity to slow Democratic momentum coming into the new year with a new legislative agenda. Democrats will not want to be blamed for a shutdown before they have even taken control of the House.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's meeting, Pelosi and Schumer issued a joint statement saying Trump's border wall proposal does not have sufficient support and he should not make it \"an obstacle to bipartisan government.\"\n\n\"Republicans still control the House, the Senate, and the White House, and they have the power to keep the government open,\" the statement said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "What's Happening With the Trump-Russia Investigation", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-happening-with-the-trump-russia-investigation/4695412.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump is facing escalating criminal investigations in Washington and New York that are examining not only whether his campaign coordinated with the Kremlin but also whether he illegally bought the silence of two women who say they had sex with him.\n\n\n\nA look at the nearly three dozen people charged by special counsel Robert Mueller and unanswered questions about what may lie ahead for the president \u2014 labeled \"Individual-1\" in court papers \u2014 and his administration:\n\n\n\nWhat's the Latest?\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan for the first time connected the president to a federal crime, accusing him of orchestrating hush-money payments during the campaign by his longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to a porn star and a former Playboy model. Cohen is due to be sentenced this week.\n\n\n\nMueller's office, meanwhile, detailed lies they say former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told them even after he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate.\n\n\n\nAnd prosecutors are preparing for the sentencing hearing next week of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who lied to the FBI about his Russian contacts.\n\n\n\nUnanswered Questions\n\n\n\n\u2014 Did the Trump campaign collude with Russia?\n\n\n\nThat remains unclear, though there is mounting evidence of direct contact throughout the campaign between Trump associates and Moscow and evidence that individuals in Trump's orbit were discussing a possible email dump from WikiLeaks before it occurred.\n\n\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies and Mueller have said Russia was the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the campaign that damaged Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential effort.\n\n\n\nAdditional ties between Russians and Trump aides were alleged within the last week. Prosecutors revealed that a Russian contacted Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" between Russia and the Republican campaign. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that that person is a former Russian Olympic athlete named Dmitry Klokov.\n\n\n\nTrump and his lawyers have returned a list of written answers on the collusion question to Mueller, but it's unclear whether investigators will return with more questions.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Did the president obstruct the investigation?\n\n\n\nThat is another unresolved question that Mueller is pursuing. Investigators have examined key episodes such as Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and his fury over the recusal from the investigation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\n\n\nThe American Defendants\n\n\n\n\u2014 Paul Manafort: He has been convicted in Washington and Virginia of crimes related to years of Ukrainian political consulting work, including allegations he concealed his foreign government work from the United States and failed to pay taxes on it. Although the charges don't directly touch Trump, he's nonetheless remained a figure of considerable intrigue and enjoys the continued sympathy of the president, who has left open the door for a pardon.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rick Gates: The longtime associate of Manafort and key Trump campaign aide was indicted last year alongside his mentor but months later split from him by pleading guilty to unregistered foreign lobbying work and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller. No sentencing date has been scheduled for Gates, indicating that his cooperation with investigators is continuing.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Michael Flynn: He has admitted lying to the FBI just days after Trump took office by telling agents that he had never discussed sanctions with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States. The White House said Flynn had misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the conversation and ousted him weeks later. He's since become a vital cooperator for Mueller, having met 19 times with investigators. Prosecutors aren't recommending any prison time when he's sentenced next week.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Michael Cohen: He's at the center of not only Mueller's investigation but also a separate investigation into hush-money payments. In Mueller's investigation, Cohen has admitted lying to Congress about a proposed real estate development in Moscow. He told lawmakers the negotiations were done in January 2016 when in fact they stretched deep into the campaign. He also pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations stemming from the payments, with prosecutors saying he ``acted in coordination and at the direction of Individual-1'' \u2014 Trump.\n\n\n\n\u2014 George Papadopoulos: The former foreign policy adviser recently finished a 14-day prison sentence after admitting lying to the FBI about a 2016 conversation with a Maltese professor who told him Russia had \"dirt\" on Clinton in the form of emails.\n\n25 Russians\n\n\n\n\u2014 Twelve military intelligence officers were charged in July with hacking the email accounts of Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and then facilitating the release of tens of thousands of private communications.

Already embraced by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., an increasingly influential figure on the left, the Green New Deal is designed to nudge prospective Democratic presidential candidates to stake out aggressive positions on climate change. Some cast the goals as idealistic and politically risky.\n\nOrganizers with the Sunrise Movement activist group frame it as a make-or-break issue for Democratic voters, particularly young ones. But they're fighting recent history on that point.\n\nHillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., jockeyed during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary over their plans to stave off the devastating effects that scientists have warned of as temperatures continue to rise. Ultimately, however, other issues dominated the debate, and climate change barely registered during the 2016 general election.\n\nStephen O'Hanlon, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, said, \u201cAny senators or any other politician who wants the votes of young people in 2020 needs to back a Green New Deal that would transform our economy and create millions of new jobs stopping climate change.\u201d\n\nAs he weighs another White House run, Sanders has staked out an early claim on the issue, hosting Ocasio-Cortez for a climate change town hall last week and preparing a forthcoming proposal that an aide said is likely to align with the broad goals of the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cNext Congress I will be working on legislation that addresses the scope of the crisis we face, creates tens of millions of jobs and saves American families money while holding fossil fuel companies accountable for the enormous damage they have done to our planet,\u201d Sanders said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cOur job is to be bold, to think very big and to go forward in a moral struggle to protect our planet and future generations.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders introduced single-payer health care legislation last year, most Senate Democrats also considering presidential runs signed on at the outset. It\u2019s not clear, however, whether other prominent Democrats eyeing the White House would back Sanders\u2019 forthcoming climate change bill or seek to carve out their own territory.\n\nSen.

Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch that his staff has held dozens of meetings since the summer aimed at shaping a broad climate bill and that he welcomes the activists' effort to spotlight the issue.\n\nThe staff of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has been in contact with the organizers behind the Green New Deal push, according to spokeswoman Lily Adams, who said the senator is broadly supportive of the sort of sweeping climate change agenda that the effort envisions. As legislation aimed at enacting the Green New Deal begins to take shape, Adams added, Harris plans to take a close look at it.\n\nThe Green New Deal deliberately omits details on how to reorient the United States toward the drastic carbon emissions reductions it calls for, instead calling for a select committee in the House to devise a plan by 2020. That timetable is designed to rally Democrats behind a climate change strategy as they're picking a nominee to take on President Donald Trump, who has rolled back multiple environmental regulations and cast doubt on the scientific consensus that human activity is driving global warming.\n\nBill McKibben, a leading environmentalist whom Sanders tapped to help write the Democratic National Committee's party platform in 2016, said that it would be \u201chard for me to imagine a serious Democratic candidate emerging\u201d in the 2020 presidential race who doesn\u2019t support a version of the Green New Deal, single-payer health care and a $15-per-hour minimum wage.\n\nA Capitol Police spokeswoman said that 138 people were arrested during Monday's demonstrations by Green New Deal supporters.\n\nThe plan, named for the New Deal that reshaped America under former President Franklin D.

In enacting a federal law, he said, Congress overstepped.\n\nNow, local lawmakers, advocates and newspapers are calling for state bans that equal or surpass the scope of the federal law that was struck down.\n\n\u2018Never again\u2019\n\nThe case Friedman ruled on centers around Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, an emergency room physician accused of performing FGM on at least 100 girls in Michigan for more than a decade.\n\nProsecutors have focused their case on nine girls, aged 7 to 12, from three states. The girls allegedly were subjected to FGM with the aid of Nagarwala and seven others, including the girls\u2019 mothers.\n\nDefense attorneys say the procedure amounted to only a \u201cnick\u201d on the girls performed as part of a religious ritual \u2014 not FGM. But they also argued in July that the federal law banning FGM is unconstitutional.\n\nState Senator Rick Jones, who represents Michigan\u2019s 24th district, told VOA by phone that he was shocked to learn about Nagarwala\u2019s case and strongly disagrees with Friedman\u2019s ruling.\n\nLast year, Jones became the spokesperson for a package of bills outlawing FGM statewide. The legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n\nNow, Michigan has some of the toughest FGM laws in the country.\n\nHealth-care providers convicted of performing FGM face up to 15 years in prison, along with the permanent loss of their medical licenses. Parents who take their daughters to doctors to be cut can lose custody.\n\nThe 1996 federal law, meanwhile, stipulated up to five years in prison and fines for medical providers who perform FGM.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to send a strong message around the world: Never again bring your girls to Michigan for this horrible procedure,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAcross the U.S., 27 states have passed laws banning FGM, many of which have been written in recent years and include penalties that go beyond the federal law, which also criminalizes so-called \u201cvacation cutting,\u201d the practice of taking girls out of the United States to have FGM performed overseas.\n\nNews organizations are among those pushing for an expansion of state laws. Last month, the Seattle Times editorial board called for a ban in Washington, one of 23 states yet to outlaw FGM.\n\nEarlier this month, the Los Angeles Times editorial board said all 50 states should ban the \u201cbarbaric\u201d practice, in light of Friedman\u2019s ruling.\n\nReligious ritual?\n\nThe health-care providers and families involved in the Michigan case belong to Dawoodi Bohra, a Shi\u2019ite Muslim sect based in India with about 2 million followers worldwide.\n\nAccording to a study published earlier this year, FGM, called khafd in Dawoodi Bohra communities, is widespread in the sect and involves cutting the clitoral hood or part of the clitoris, without an anesthetic, when girls turn seven.\n\nThe study, commissioned by WeSpeakOut, an advocacy group focused on eradicating khafd, also found that three-quarters of Dawoodi Bohra women have experienced FGM.\n\nThe severity and nature of FGM can vary.\n\nHealth-care providers have identified four types of FGM. Khafd involves Type 1 FGM. Other types involve removing all of the external genitalia and narrowing the vaginal opening.\n\nJones rejects the idea that there\u2019s a religious basis for the procedure, however it\u2019s performed.\n\n\u201cAcross the world, this has been practiced by Christians, pagans, Muslims, even a small Jewish sect in Ethiopia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not about a religion,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is about men attempting to control women\u2019s behavior by this horrible procedure.\u201d\n\nThe WHO identifies both short-term and permanent harms associated with the practice. Immediate concerns include severe pain, infections and, in some cases, death. Long term, women and girls subjected to FGM face a range of physiological and psychological complications that can affect menstruation, childbirth and sexual health.\n\nThe United States has been unequivocal in condemning the practice, saying \u201cthe U.S. government considers FGM/C to be a serious human rights abuse, and a form of gender-based violence and child abuse\u201d on a fact sheet posted to the Citizenship & Immigration Services website.\n\nEducation and legislation\n\nFriedman\u2019s November decision is the latest in a series of setbacks for prosecutors.\n\nNagarwala spent seven months in 2017 in jail before 16 friends posted a $4.5 million unsecured bond, against the pleas of prosecutors, who argued Nagarwala could silence potential witnesses or even flee the country if released.\n\nAnd in January, the judge dismissed charges that Nagarwala and a second doctor, Fakhruddin Attar, transported minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, an offense that carries a lifetime sentence.\n\nNagarwala still faces conspiracy and obstruction charges that could result in decades in prison.\n\nThe trial is now set to begin next April, the Detroit Free Press reported last month. However, the prosecution could appeal last month\u2019s decision, drawing the case out further.\n\nLooking beyond the Michigan case, Jones said the key to stopping FGM isn\u2019t just legislation but also education.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is continue to fight this worldwide. This is a global problem,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cIt is a violation of human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to continue speaking out worldwide against this horrible, horrible practice that must end.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "NASA Probe Finds Signs of Water on Nearby Asteroid Bennu", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-probe-finds-signs-of-water-on-nearby-asteroid-bennu/4695391.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has discovered ingredients for water on a relatively nearby skyscraper-sized asteroid, a rocky acorn-shaped object that may hold clues to the origins of life on Earth, scientists said on Monday.\n\nOSIRIS-REx, which flew last week within a scant 12 miles (19 km) of the asteroid Bennu some 1.4 million miles (2.25 million km) from Earth, found traces of hydrogen and oxygen molecules \u2014 part of the recipe for water and thus the potential for life \u2014 embedded in the asteroid's rocky surface.\n\nThe probe, on a mission to return samples from the asteroid to Earth for study, was launched in 2016. Bennu, roughly a third of a mile wide (500 meters), orbits the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. There is concern among scientists about the possibility of Bennu impacting Earth late in the 22nd century.\n\n\"We have found the water-rich minerals from the early solar system, which is exactly the kind of sample we were going out there to find and ultimately bring back to Earth,\" University of Arizona planetary scientist Dante Lauretta, the OSIRIS-REx mission's principal investigator, said in a telephone interview.\n\nAsteroids are among the leftover debris from the solar system's formation some 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth may have delivered organic compounds and water that seeded the planet for life, and atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could provide key evidence to support that hypothesis.\n\n\"When samples of this material are returned by the mission to Earth in 2023, scientists will receive a treasure trove of new information about the history and evolution of our solar system,\" Amy Simon, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement.\n\n\"We're really trying to understand the role that these carbon-rich asteroids played in delivering water to the early Earth and making it habitable,\" Lauretta added.\n\nOSIRIS-REx will pass later this month just 1.2 miles (1.9 km) from Bennu, entering the asteroid's gravitational pull and analyzing its terrain. From there, the spacecraft will begin to gradually tighten its orbit around the asteroid, spiraling to within just 6 feet (2 meters) of its surface so its robot arm can snatch a sample of Bennu by July 2020.\n\nThe spacecraft will later fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid specimen for a parachute descent in the Utah desert in September 2023."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Croak to Croon: City Frogs Sing More Alluring Love Songs", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/croak-to-croon-city-frogs-sing-more-alluring-love-songs/4695382.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "City frogs and rainforest frogs don't sing the same tune, researchers have found.\n\n\n\nA study released Monday examined why Panama's tiny tungara frogs adapt their mating calls in urban areas \u2014 an unexpected example of how animals change communication strategies when cities encroach on forests.\n\n\n\nThese frogs take advantage of the relative absence of eavesdropping predators in cities to belt out longer love songs, which are more alluring to female frogs.\n\n\n\nTungara frogs don't croak like American bullfrogs. To human ears, their distinctive call sounds like a low-pitched, video-game beep. To female frogs, it sounds like pillow talk.\n\n\n\nEvery evening at sunset, the 1-inch male brown frogs crawl into puddles to serenade prospective mates. The lady frog selects a mate largely based on his love song.\n\n\n\nResearchers found that the urban frogs call faster, more frequently and add more embellishments \u2014 a series of staccato \"chucks\" on the end of the initial whine \u2014 compared with those in the forest.\n\n\n\nThose fancy urban love songs are three times more likely to attract the ladies, as scientists learned by playing back recordings of both city and forest frog calls to an audience of female frogs in a laboratory. Thirty of 40 female frogs hopped over to the speaker playing the urban frog calls, the researchers report in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\n\n\nWhether the female frogs hailed from the city or forest themselves, they showed the same preference for fast-paced, complex crooning that combines high and low tones in quick arrangements.\n\n\n\nStudy co-author Michael J. Ryan, a biologist at the University of Texas who has studied tungara frogs for more than 30 years, said that the high and low notes likely stimulated the inner and outer ear chambers of female frogs in a pleasurable or interesting way.\n\n\n\nSo why don't rainforest frogs sing the same way?\n\n\n\nThe scientists set out to confirm their hypothesis that frogs that added extra high-pitched \"chucks\" attracted not only more mates, but also more trouble from frog-eating bats and parasitic midges. With the help of camera traps and sticky paper, the researchers demonstrated that extended frog calls significantly increased the risk of attracting predators.\n\n\n\nIn the rainforest, the frogs must balance two goals: attracting a mate and staying safe.\n\n\n\nIn the city, there are no frog-eating bats, and far fewer snakes and midges. The male frogs are freer to belt their hearts out.\n\n\n\n\"An urban male can take greater risks,\" said lead author Wouter Halfwerk, an ecologist at Vrije University in Amsterdam.\n\n\n\nA town frog also has to work harder to find a mate because lady frogs are rarer in the city. \"Competition for females increases,\" said Halfwerk. \"The best adaptation is to be the most attractive, with an elaborate love song.\"\n\n\n\nCorinne Lee Zawacki, a biologist at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the study, said the researchers' methodology confirmed that urbanization is the reason for the call changes.\n\n\n\n\"I love the choice of study system,\" she said. \"A lot of background research has already been done on this frog. So we can see clearly how urbanization changes the interplay of natural and sexual selection\" \u2014 or the trade-offs between survival and courtship goals.\n\n\n\nBut not all amphibians are as lucky as Panama's tungara frogs.\n\n\n\n\"Amphibian populations are declining worldwide, mostly due to habitat destruction,\" said Andrew Blaustein an ecologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study. \"This is a rare case \u2014 and a very interesting case \u2014 of an animal adapting quickly, in evolutionary terms, to new circumstances.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Chinese Court Bans iPhone Models in Patent Dispute", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/qualcomm-wins-chinese-ban-on-most-iphone-sales-in-patent-war/4694725.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "A Chinese court has ordered a ban in the country on most iPhone sales because of a patent dispute between iPhone maker Apple and U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm.\n\nThe Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court granted Qualcomm's request for preliminary injunctions against four subsidiaries of Apple, ordering them to immediately stop selling the iPhone 6S through the iPhone X that use older versions of Apple's iOS operating system, according to a statement from Qualcomm Monday.\n\nApple said in a statement Monday its iPhones using newer operating systems remain on sale in China.\n\nThe Chinese court found Apple violated two of Qualcomm's software patents involving resizing photographs and managing applications on a touch screen.\n\nApple shares fell Monday on the news.\n\n\"Qualcomm's effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\" Apple said in its statement.\n\nQualcomm's general counsel, Don Rosenberg, said in a statement Monday \"Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us.

My belief is let\u2019s see where we can work together and move America forward,\u201d McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in the House, behind House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Monday during an appearance on Fox News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve investigated this for a long period of time,\u201d McCarthy added. \u201cBoth sides have come up with nothing in the process. I think we should put the American people first.\u201d\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team hasn\u2019t exactly produced \u201cnothing\u201d in its time investigating Russian interference during the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. They\u2019ve indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 33 people and three companies so far \u2014 the latest being Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nUpon taking charge of House committees in January, Democrats are also expected to launch investigations into some of the biggest Trump controversies Republicans have downplayed or ignored over the last two years: the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, allegations of obstruction of justice, the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia and hush money payments to two women who claim they had affairs with the president.\n\nIn a memo filed last week, federal prosecutors alleged for the first time that Cohen broke campaign finance laws by making payments to the women to keep them silent during the campaign \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of Trump.\u201d The revelations from Mueller and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York sparked fresh speculation over the weekend about a possible indictment of Trump or perhaps even impeachment.\n\nMcCarthy downplayed the matter in the Fox News interview, however, arguing that \u201clots of members\u201d of Congress have engaged in similar violations of campaign finance law.\n\nMcCarthy had a seemingly different view of the House\u2019s oversight responsibilities in 2016 when he boasted on national television that the House Select Committee on Benghazi had hurt then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls. Republicans set up the panel, as well as several other lengthy investigations, to investigate the deadly 2012 attack on the Libya consulate in Benghazi when Clinton was secretary of state. McCarthy\u2019s remark was seen as a damaging gaffe that even his fellow Republicans were forced to distance themselves from.\n\nDemocrats walloped Republicans in November\u2019s midterm election \u2015 flipping an impressive 40 House seats \u2015 in part by telling voters they would serve as a check on Trump\u2019s volatile presidency. But most candidates spent a majority of time talking about bread-and-butter issues, such as health care and jobs, not the seemingly endless controversies in Washington.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have been clear for months that our top priorities will be lowering the cost of prescription drugs, raising wages by rebuilding America and restoring integrity in Washington.

Roof is in an Indiana prison awaiting execution. According to a U.S. attorney\u2019s office press release, Lecron also \u201cattempted to send [Roof] Nazis literature.\u201d\n\nLecron allegedly had a Tumblr account called \u201cCharlestonChurchMiracle,\u201d on which she posted photos and comments about mass shootings.\n\nThe FBI says agents raided Lecron\u2019s home and found an AK-47, a shotgun, handguns and materials that could be used to construct pipe bombs.

He is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to ISIS.\n\nHe was arrested Friday after purchasing two AR-15 rifles from an undercover agent, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Toledo.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of months, Damon Joseph progressed from radicalized, virtual jihadist to attack planner,\u201d FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeff Fortunato said in a statement. \u201cHe ultimately decided to target two Toledo-area synagogues for a mass-casualty attack in the name of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Joseph came to the attention of FBI agents after posting photos of weapons to his social media accounts. He also allegedly posted a photo distributed by ISIS.\n\nAuthorities say Joseph later told undercover agents that he was an ISIS supporter and sent the agents videos he had made in hopes of recruiting more people to join ISIS.\n\nAn official at the press conference Monday stated that Joseph had told an undercover agent that he hated \u201cthe gays, the Christians, the Catholics, the Jews, you name it.\u201d\n\nAfter a white supremacist killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October, Joseph allegedly told an undercover agent that \u201cJewish people are evil and they got what was coming to them.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 6, Joseph allegedly met with the undercover agent and said he wanted to target two synagogues in Toledo, but then said it was more realistic to attack one.\n\nJoseph allegedly wrote the name and address of the synagogue he wanted to attack and told the undercover agent that he wanted to kill a rabbi and target the place of worship during the Jewish Sabbath."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump's Businesses Have Charged $1.1 Million To His Own Re-election Campaign: Forbes", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-businesses-charged-2020-re-election-campaign_us_5c0c8acee4b0ab8cf693fb8a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump\u2019s companies have charged $1.1 million to his re-election campaign, according to federal election documents.\n\n\u201cThat means the richest president in American history has turned $1.1 million from donors across the country into revenue for himself,\u201d Forbes reported last week.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t donated \u201ca penny\u201d of his own money to his re-election campaign, which was launched during his inaugural parties, Forbes noted.\n\nIn a 2000 interview with Fortune magazine, Trump boasted that if he ever ran for president, it\u2019s \u201cvery possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.\u201d\n\nBusinesses owned by the president charged his own campaign for rent, hotel bills, catering and \u201clegal consulting,\u201d according to an analysis of federal election filings by Forbes.\n\nTrump Tower Commercial LLC, wholly owned by the president, charged the re-election campaign $665,000 in rent, according to the documents.

Infections are rare, but it can cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) of the brain, which is almost always fatal.\n\nThe woman was treated with a combination of drugs but nevertheless fell comatose and her family eventually decided to withdraw life support.\n\nHealth officials reportedly found evidence the woman had been treating her sinus infection for about a year using a neti pot that she was filling with tap water poured through a store-bought water filter.\n\nNeti pots are small vessels that are used to flush the sinuses.

This menu comes from the United Nations climate talks taking place in Poland this month \u2015 a series of discussions aimed at coming up with solutions for saving the planet.\n\nWith multiple warnings from scientists in the past few weeks about the climate effects of eating meat and our need to reduce overconsumption, the menu for delegates was quickly criticized as hypocritical.\n\nMeat and dairy production represents 14.5 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Unless we cut back on our overconsumption of meat in rich countries, it will be almost impossible, climate analysts say, to prevent global warming from bringing temperatures up by a dangerous 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\u201cThe meat-laden menu at COP24 is an insult to the work of the conference,\u201d said Stephanie Feldstein, director of the population and sustainability program at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be serving up cheeseburgers at climate conferences if we\u2019re going to have an honest conversation about the role of food in the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nBetween 2010 and 2050, global meat and dairy consumption is on course to increase by nearly 70 percent, according to data published by the World Resources Institute. Shifting the diets of higher-income consumers toward plant-based foods is vital, climate researchers say, to prevent runaway climate change.\n\nI kept asking myself, what\u2019s Al Gore eating? Turns out he took a packed lunch with him from his hotel each day. Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green\n\nIf the U.N. conference organizers had replaced the beef burgers with plant-based ones, it would have cut the climate emissions associated with each burger by 82 percent, campaigners pointed out.\n\n\u201cWhile meat doesn\u2019t need to be entirely eliminated from global diets in order to meet climate goals, the conference menu should reflect the way forward, which means mostly plant-based dishes and smaller portions of meat and dairy when they are used,\u201d Feldstein said. \u201cMeat and dairy can no longer be the default.\u201d\n\nIt was only in October that the U.N.\u2019s own climate advisers listed dietary changes as an effective strategy for tackling climate change. But delegates and campaigners say food is still treated as an afterthought in U.N. climate talks.\n\n\u201cComing from civil society in Sweden, where vegetarian food is the norm in most NGOs no matter their focus, I think it is shocking,\u201d said Lotta Velin, Sweden\u2019s youth delegate to the U.N. climate talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hugely surprised that the menu at COP24 is meat- and dairy-heavy, but it sends a strange and unhelpful message nonetheless,\u201d said Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green, a public policy organization. \u201cAt the Paris climate talks it was really hard to eat as a vegan. I kept asking myself, what\u2019s Al Gore eating? Turns out he took a packed lunch with him from his hotel each day!\u201d\n\nMacDonald said the big and \u201cdeeply problematic\u201d issue is not the meaty menu at the U.N. talks, but the lack of concrete policies to reduce emissions from livestock production and consumption and the failure to promote more plant-based alternatives.\n\nThat lack of progress is because governments are wary of trying to tell people what to eat, says Richard Waite, a food specialist at WRI. \u201cThere\u2019s been more attention about how to mitigate the impact on agriculture, but not dietary change and consumers. So even though awareness of diet and climate link is growing, there is still this cognitive dissonance,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat can make a difference for now, WRI says, is encouraging more companies and restaurants to improve the availability of plant-based alternatives.\n\nU.S. retail sales of plant-based meats have risen 17 percent over the past year, with 39 percent of American consumers working to incorporate more plant-based foods in their diets. The catering company Sodexo has launched 200 plant-based and plant-rich recipes in the U.S. The fast-food chain Max Burgers has set a goal that by 2022, half of all meals it sells at its 120 restaurants worldwide will be made of foods other than beef.\n\n\u201cIn the future, a lot of progress will depend on whether we really have substitutes that are close to the experience of meat and cheaper,\u201d said Tim Searchinger, a lecturer at Princeton University and fellow at WRI. \u201cAnd we are seeing that with the enormously tastier plant-based burgers coming on the market. Over time, they are going to be cheaper. In the long run, a lot of these things will be determined by availability and price.\u201d\n\nThis story has been amended to correct an earlier mistranscription of Waite\u2019s comments.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "SNL's Vanessa Bayer Talks Battling Leukemia And Her Epic End-Of-Chemo Party", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vanessa-bayer-leukemia_us_5c0d5d80e4b035a7bf5c4903", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Monica Schipper via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer attends the premiere of the Netflix film \"Ibiza\" last May in New York.\n\nVanessa Bayer is eternally cheerful \u2015 even when she\u2019s talking about her battle with blood cancer.\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star, who left the show in 2017 after seven seasons of Rachel Green impressions and Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy sketches, recently spoke with HuffPost about having leukemia as a teenager and her new partnership with Gift of Life \u2015 a bone marrow registry dedicated to fighting blood cancer.\n\nSomehow Bayer \u2015 known for her megawatt smile \u2015 manages to make talking about her battle with blood cancer like just another thing that happens to anyone \u2014 like something as simple as getting stitches or a cast for a broken bone.\n\nAside from opening up about defeating cancer, the 37-year-old comedian also spoke about her epic end-of-chemo party that got busted by the police, Pete Davidson ruling the headlines this summer and, of course, performing that infamous \u201cPorn Stars\u201d sketch with Donald Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nNBC via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer, Donald Trump and Cecily Strong during the Nov. 7, 2015, \"Porn Stars\" sketch on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHow did you get involved with Gift of Life?\n\nThey came to me. As a survivor of blood cancer \u2015 it was just something really close to my heart. And when I heard about their amazing work that they\u2019ve done I definitely wanted to get involved.\n\nTell me about your childhood and battling cancer.\n\nWhen I was 15 I was diagnosed with ALL \u2015 acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u2015 and so I was treated for about two-and-a-half years. It was obviously a difficult thing to go through. I do think surviving something like that definitely affected my sense of humor and made me want to go into comedy because my family, my friends and I all laughed about it a lot.\n\nI was very lucky because once I was treated for leukemia it never recurred, but I know that had it recurred there was a likelihood I would have had to get a bone marrow transplant. The Gift of Life registry was created out of someone needing a bone marrow transplant and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so close to my heart.\n\nHow did you find out that you had blood cancer?\n\nIt generally shows somewhere and my eyes swelled up. I was getting sick and not getting better \u2015 this was all in ninth grade. I was having all of these issues and then I was diagnosed. I think they took a sample \u2015 biopsied my bone marrow or something \u2015 and saw that I had it. Again, I was 15 and it\u2019s a long treatment but it\u2019s curable right now. I was very lucky.\n\nWhat was it like to hear that you had cancer? Who was in the room with you?\n\nI feel like my parents were in the room with me \u2015 it was such a long time ago. It was definitely a scary thing, but I had a lot of support from my family and I was always very optimistic in general. I always felt like I was on a path to recovery.\n\nWhat would you say to someone who\u2019s scared to sign up for the registry?\n\nI understand, but it\u2019s actually not a scary thing at all. Basically, the way that the process works is that you get swabbed and if you find out that you\u2019re a match you do something that\u2019s similar to giving plasma or platelets, basically blood is drawn.\n\nThey take the stem cells out of it and then they give you back the blood. It\u2019s nothing scary, it\u2019s nothing crazy. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest misconceptions \u2015 that giving stem cells or giving bone marrow is this scary thing and it\u2019s not.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Bayer talking about battling blood cancer on the \"Today\" show on Nov. 30.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t know what to say when someone has cancer. What would you want them to know?\n\nI think the most important thing with someone with cancer or any kind of illness is just to say something. And just remember that it\u2019s the same person and they\u2019re still your friend or your colleague. I think it\u2019s just important to show up for that person.\n\nWhat did you think of someone like Tig Notaro integrating cancer into her comedy?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing. I mean, she is so funny. I think she was on \u201cConan\u201d when she did that bit where she was like \u201ccancer has made me be so much more present,\u201d and then she was like, looking on her cell phone. I mean, she\u2019s a genius. I think it\u2019s great [she talks about cancer in her work]. It\u2019s kind of like what we were saying before \u2015 if someone has cancer or has something, they\u2019re still the same person. And I think when someone can joke about it, it puts everyone else at ease a little bit.\n\nHow did having leukemia shape your comedy?\n\nIn college I was in this all-female sketch group called Bloomers. But I just think in general in my comedy there were just so many funny and interesting and awkward moments when I was sick. I think that kind of getting through that made me be able to see funny things in all situations.\n\nWhat were some of the awkward moments about getting sick?\n\nWell, I mean anyone who spends a lot of the time in the hospital knows and, by the way, I\u2019m not like \u2015 my comedy isn\u2019t full of poop jokes or anything, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re so monitored on how much, your poop is checked so much. You know, it\u2019s important. Whenever you\u2019re in a hospital setting, they\u2019re always kind of like, \u201cDid you go?\u201d\n\nHow many times were you asked that [did you go]?\n\nI just feel like I was asked it all the time. When you\u2019re in a hospital setting, [Bayer turns to her PR team laughing and says \u201cIs this a great thing for me to be talking about?\u201d] pooping is important. And my best friend Gwen is a nurse and she\u2019s like \u201cYeah, you gotta [ask].\u201d\n\nHow long were you in the hospital?\n\nI was in and out. When I was first there, I was there for a couple weeks, but then I\u2019d have to go in for certain procedures or if something came up I\u2019d have to go back. I had the most intensive treatment for 10 months and then I had what they call maintenance chemo for two more years after that. I think the summer before my senior year of high school is when I finally stopped chemo. And I had an end-of-chemo party.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nIt was so fun. My parents got me a really big cake. I think I had a big sheet cake and I think it said, \u201cHappy End-of-Chemo Vanessa\u201d or something and so many of my friends came and it was so fun. And then my brother was in a band and his band played in our backyard and then the police came \u2019cause they thought that it was like a \u201crager\u201d \u2015 my parents and I were just talking about this over Thanksgiving.\n\nThe police thought we were drinking and we were like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re literally celebrating the end of me having chemo.\u201d My parents said they were going through the trash and trying to find bottles and stuff and [we were like] this couldn\u2019t be a more positive party. We\u2019re literally just celebrating the end of me having chemo.\n\nWhat did the police end up doing?\n\nI think they finally left, but said \u2019cause of the noise my brother\u2019s band had to stop playing.\n\nHow did you balance having cancer with applying for colleges?\n\nWell, I guess \u2015 if you really think about it \u2015 I had a great thing to write a college essay about.\n\nI did think about that. But just the amount of work that goes into applying for school, too.\n\nI guess I was just hyper-focused on school because I wanted to make sure that having this illness wouldn\u2019t affect my future. Especially once the more intense part of my chemo [treatments] were over, I really was so focused on school. It was really a priority for me.\n\nWhat did you go to school for? What did you think you were going to do?\n\nI thought I would maybe be a biology major [at the University of Pennsylvania, where Bayer went] because I thought that I could do medical research and stuff like that. But then everyone was so smart [laughs].\n\nI was in some really intense science classes and I always thought that I wanted to be a medical researcher who was on TV or something, so then I was like, \u201cOh I think I want to be on TV.\u201d So I actually ended up being a communications major, and I was a French major as well because I studied abroad.\n\nHow did you go from college to being on \u201cSNL\u201d about six years later?\n\nI made the transition from biology pretty quickly my freshman year. I did this sketch group, Bloomers, in college and I performed a lot. I also interned one summer at \u201cConan\u201d and I kind of realized that I wanted to pursue comedy when I was in college. I moved to Chicago after school and I started taking classes at Second City and the iO [theater] and The Annoyance [Theater] and stuff.\n\nAnd I saw that you interned at Sesame Street \u2015 what was that like?\n\nIt was over the summer so they weren\u2019t in production, but it was really magical. We got to go to the set once and it was really amazing.\n\nWhat memories do you have from your first and your last day at \u201cSaturday Night Live?\u201d\n\nI remember from my first day just meeting a lot of the other cast and just being so starstruck by them. And just being like okay, I\u2019m going to have to act like this is normal until I think that it\u2019s normal. And then my last day was just so special, I just remember we were being carried off stage and stuff and it was just so amazing.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer getting carried off stage after her last \"SNL\" show on May 20, 2017.\n\nWhy did you leave?\n\nI just felt like it was time. I just had this feeling like it\u2019s time for me to go and I knew that the show was in such great hands with Aidy [Bryant] and Kate [McKinnon] and Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney and everybody.\n\nHow do you tell Lorne Michaels that you were leaving?\n\nI think that we had a discussion about it. He\u2019s always been very supportive. So I feel like I can be very honest with him. I felt like we had a very honest conversation about it.\n\nWas it hard to tell the cast that you were leaving? When did you tell them?\n\nI don\u2019t remember it exactly. I feel like everyone was supportive and we\u2019ll miss you, but we understand. It\u2019s a very hectic schedule so it\u2019s like, after seven years, I want to take a nap [laughs].\n\nSpeaking of that, your New York Times \u201cSunday Routine\u201d has a cult following . Why do you think it resonates so much?\n\nYou know, someone else just brought this up to me. That\u2019s really nice. I do think that normally those \u201cSunday Routines\u201d are so busy and I think it just makes you feel bad about yourself. Like, I don\u2019t get up at six a.m. and make breakfast with my kids or whatever and go to, like, spin class. I think it puts people at ease that most of us are just ordering bagels and then spending whatever I said, spending like 10 minutes being mad that it\u2019s not toasted.\n\nAnd [as you mentioned in your NYT piece] it\u2019s such a New York thing to wonder what your doorman thinks of you. What do you think your doorman thinks of you?\n\nWell, in my building now, not to brag, but I have several different doormen. So I could order breakfast and if I wait two hours and order lunch, they don\u2019t know. But you know if I order multiple dinners, they\u2019re gonna know.\n\nWhat do you think most people\u2019s impression of you is? How do you think you come across to fans?\n\nI think most people think I\u2019m just like a stone-cold bitch.\n\nREALLY?\n\nNo [laughs]. I think everyone knows that I smile a lot so they probably think that I\u2019m pretty nice, but again\u2026 [shrugs].\n\nNBC via Getty Images Michael Che and Vanessa Bayer as 'Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy' during \"Weekend Update\" on \"SNL\" on April 15, 2017.\n\nWhat do people \u2015 when they recognize you on the street \u2015 what do they say to you?\n\nSometimes people think they\u2019ve gone to high school with me. But people are generally very nice. A lot of guys mention [my \u201cSNL\u201d character] the Bar Mitzvah Boy and say they can relate to that time in their life. But people are generally very nice or they think they know me from high school. \u2019Cause you know, we wore so many wigs on \u201cSNL,\u201d so they know your face, but they\u2019re just like, \u201cNew Jersey?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNope.\u201d\n\nIs it weird that people you\u2019ve known for so long, like Pete Davidson, can suddenly be every headline in the news?\n\nYeah, I guess so, although that happens a lot, you know what I mean? I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people that I\u2019ve known that that\u2019s happened to. And that stuff\u2019s always kind of, you know, it has a moment and then it dies down \u2015 thank goodness for them \u2015 \u2019cause it\u2019s a lot.\n\nIt is ever a lot for you when people ask you personal questions, like are you dating?\n\nYeah, I mean it is, but I feel like it sort of comes with the territory. And you know, I never feel like I have to answer everything.\n\nBut you did talk to Drake about JDate [an online dating service for Jewish singles] one time.\n\nYes, Drake did my web series [\u201cSound Advice\u201d], which I did with my brother. And yeah, he was a great sport about it. I mean, I was kind of asking him in character, but apparently he\u2019s not on JDate. Which, missed opportunity, right?\n\nWhat\u2019s your inspiration for the character you play on \u201cSound Advice?\u201d\n\nI feel like my brother and I would always say we wanted \u2015 and we did it with this \u201d[Weekend] Update\u201d writer Pete Schultz \u2015 we always wanted it to be the woman from \u201cMillionaire Matchmaker,\u201d Patti Stanger, and Zach Galifianakis from \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d That was the combo we were always trying to meet. And so once someone said that it seemed like a combo of those two, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve done our job.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Donald Trump on \u201cSNL?\u201d Do you regret working with him at all?\n\nI mean, it was just interesting. It was so weird because he could only do a certain amount of time because he\u2019s running for president. Cecily and I did the ex-porn stars thing with him and I remember he asked me like, \u201cShould I do it?\u201d and I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I wanted to do this sketch and we couldn\u2019t believe that he was gonna do it and it was just sort of surreal. We were all sort of like, \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d But also nobody thought that he was gonna win, you know? It was weird, it was crazy.\n\nDid you ever have any interaction with him in the week leading up to his appearance?\n\nNot a ton. Every week is sort of like a blur, but yeah it\u2019s just so crazy that he did that \u2015 that he was on the show. It\u2019s so weird."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michael Che Interrupts \u2018SNL\u2019 With A \u2018Glorious\u2019 Message About Butt-Cleaning", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-che-bidet_us_5c0dfd63e4b0a606a9aa1d38", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Michael Che loves his bidet... and he wants the world to know it.\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live: Weekend Update\u201d co-anchor interrupted his own segment with an ode to the best way to clean your bottom."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me.

In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture. Once those RNA packages arrive at the epididymis, the hypothesis goes, they prompt a of cascade of changes at conception that evade the stripping, or rebooting, process and the subsequent reshuffling during early development.\n\nThe critics are far from persuaded. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice work , and yes, there are changes in the testicular cells,\u201d said John M.

More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what the N.I.H. study aims to address?\n\nYes. The ongoing A.B.C.D. study expects to follow 11,800 children through adolescence, with annual magnetic resonance imaging, to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health. The study began in 2013, recruiting 21 academic research centers, and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain.
