A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date,\" Trump tweeted\n\nJUST WATCHED Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired 01:52\n\nThe move is an abrupt end to what had been a tumultuous tenure for Sessions, originally one of Trump's earliest and most loyal surrogates as an Alabama Republican senator. He was a key figure in implementing Trump's vision for America and significantly rolled back Obama-era policies on immigration, police reform and civil rights.\n\nSessions was an enforcer of much of the Trump administration's hardline approach on immigration and regularly praised the President's tough words on crime. But even as he continued to carry out the Trump agenda, his relationship with the President remained strained and fraught for months due to the ongoing Mueller investigation.\n\nSessions received the request to resign from Kelly, not the President, on Wednesday morning, an administration official said. It is not clear whether Mueller was told ahead of time.\n\nJustice Department employees were not officially notified of Sessions' ouster nor of Whitaker's appointment before the President's tweet and media reports announced the news, sources within the department say.\n\nTrump constantly criticized Sessions\n\nSessions' ouster came a day after the midterm elections saw Republicans hold onto control of the Senate -- which would confirm Trump's eventual permanent choice to head the Justice Department -- and just weeks after Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud and Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight charges including tax fraud and bank fraud.\n\nSessions was aware that Cohen was facing bank fraud and tax violations but had been walled off from the campaign finance aspects of the investigation into Trump's former lawyer, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.\n\nTrump's distaste for Sessions was well known -- and publicly reinforced by the President himself on a regular basis -- after the attorney general recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 campaign early in Trump's term.\n\nThe President mocked Sessions in August as \" scared stiff and Missing in Action .\" Later the same month as Trump continued to rail against him, Sessions issued a statement firing back at Trump and declaring, \"While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action.\"\n\nJust days later, Trump knocked the Sessions-led Justice Department for indicting two Trump-supporting Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm elections. Both lawmakers won their re-election bids Tuesday.\n\nBut Sessions hung on, and although there was no formal reconciliation, the President allowed him to stay, even despite the unwillingness of White House spokespeople to publicly confirm, for days, that Trump had confidence in the attorney general.\n\nIn early August, Trump tweeted that Sessions \"should stop\" Mueller's investigation, raising questions as to whether the President was attempting to obstruct justice. Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was merely \"expressing his opinion on his favorite medium.\"\n\nSessions, for his part, consistently maintained that his recusal decision was made in consultation with career ethics officials at the Justice Department and was in the works from the time he was sworn in.\n\nDemocrats demand continued independence for Mueller\n\nTop Democrats immediately called for Mueller's investigation to be allowed to proceed.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Schumer said.\n\nFormer Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder declared interference with the special counsel \"a red line.\"\n\n\"Anyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable. This is a red line. We are a nation of laws and norms not subject to the self interested actions of one man,\" Holder tweeted.\n\nAnyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable.

Jerry Nadler tweeted a vow for accountability. Nadler is poised to chair the House Judiciary Committee next year.\n\n\"Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation?

Look, this is about Russia.\"\n\nThe President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\n\nAccording to a CNN article, Mueller's investigators could be looking into financial records relating to the Trump Organization that are unrelated to the 2016 election. According to these reports, \"sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 election.\" The piece goes on to cite law enforcement sources who say non-Russia-related leads that \"involve Trump associates\" are being referred to the special counsel \"to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate.\"\n\nThis information is deeply concerning to me. It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Fighting

Lise Grande, told CNN.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition claimed Monday it had made significant gains in the battle to capture Hodeidah from the Houthis.\n\nA Houthi leader on Wednesday said the latest military escalation by the Saudi-led coalition was in line with an \"American vision.\"\n\n\"Based on experience in the past, we know that this is an American style, they call for peace while they are preparing for a new military aggression,\" Abdul Malik al-Houthi said in a speech broadcast on pro-Houthi al-Masirah TV.\n\n\"The Saudi aggression primarily depends on US military supervision,

Hodeidah was putting children in the city's hospital in grave danger.\n\nThe lives of 59 children are at risk, it said, including 25 who are in the intensive care unit at the city's al-Thawra hospital.\n\nHodeidah and the neighboring governates account for 40% of the 400,000 children in the country who suffer from severe acute malnutrition, UNICEF said. \"Some of the sickest are taken to the hospital for urgent care,\" it added.\n\nMeanwhile, up to 80% of Yemen's humanitarian supplies, fuel and commercial goods are delivered through Hodeidah's port, around which fighting has reportedly intensified, the agency said.\n\n\"The toll in lives could be catastrophic if the port is damaged, destroyed or blocked,\" it warned.\n\nThe three-year conflict between the US-backed,

-- a road linking between the capital, Sanaa, and Hodeidah -- as a battleground,\" Hussain Albukhaiti told CNN by phone. \"The coalition distributed pamphlets two months ago warning people and their cars to stay clear of that road.\"\n\nThe coalition said in September that its targeting operations in Yemen resembled the \"highest international standards\" and pledged to investigate incidents involving civilian deaths reported on by CNN.\n\nThe US military provides the Saudi coalition with training meant to help minimize civilian casualties, as well as aerial refueling of coalition warplanes.\n\nUN experts from the World Food Programme say that the coalition's bombings of civilians are potential war crimes and that its partial blockade of the country has put 12 million men, women and children at risk of starvation in what could become the worst famine in 100 years.\n\nThe situation in Yemen is \"an unprecedented human tragedy,\" the head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, said Tuesday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's administration has drawn criticism from activists and some members of Congress for its support for the Saudi-led

He was a key figure in implementing Trump's vision for America and significantly rolled back Obama-era policies on immigration, police reform and civil rights.\n\nSessions was an enforcer of much of the Trump administration's hardline approach on immigration and regularly praised the President's tough words on crime. But even as he continued to carry out the Trump agenda, his relationship with the President remained strained and fraught for months due to the ongoing Mueller investigation.\n\nSessions received the request to resign from Kelly, not the President, on Wednesday morning, an administration official said.

I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action.\"\n\nJust days later, Trump knocked the Sessions-led Justice Department for indicting two Trump-supporting Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm elections. Both lawmakers won their re-election bids Tuesday.\n\nBut Sessions hung on, and although there was no formal reconciliation, the President allowed him to stay, even despite the unwillingness of White House spokespeople to publicly confirm, for days, that Trump had confidence in the attorney general.\n\nIn early August, Trump tweeted that Sessions \"should stop\" Mueller's investigation, raising questions as to whether the President was attempting to obstruct justice. Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was merely \"expressing his opinion on his favorite medium.\"\n\nSessions, for his part, consistently maintained that his recusal decision was made in consultation with career ethics officials at the Justice Department and was in the works from the time he was sworn in.\n\nDemocrats demand continued independence for Mueller\n\nTop Democrats immediately called for Mueller's investigation to be allowed to proceed.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Schumer said.\n\nFormer Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder declared interference with the special counsel \"a red line.\"\n\n\"Anyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable.

There were more than 150 statewide measures on ballots this midterm election , and several involved health-related issues such as taxes on feminine hygiene products, Medicaid expansion, abortion access and legalizing the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana. Based on the preliminary vote results, here's what some voters went for and what they rejected.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2 adds language to the state Constitution to give a fetus the same rights as a human who has been born.\n\nAbortion rights supporters worry that the amendment could be used to criminalize some forms of in-vitro fertilization and contraception. There are also concerns that should the US Supreme Court end Roe v. Wade, this amendment would be a \"trigger ban,\" meaning abortion would be outlawed in some states.\n\nThis \"personhood\" ballot measure doesn't have exemptions like in other states' laws that carve out the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1 narrowly passed . Also known as the No Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment, it explicitly states that its Constitution has nothing in it that \"secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" Unlike Alabama's law, it has an exception for rape, incest, fetal anomaly or threats to the woman's life. It also restricts Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nMarijuana\n\nAdult recreational users of weed will be able to use it legally in another state.\n\nAccording to preliminary results, more than 54% of voters i n Michigan said yes to the initiative that imposes a 10-ounce limit for Michigan residents, creates a state licensing system, will allow for retail sales subject to a 10% tax and changes several weed-related violations to civil infractions.\n\nThat makes 10 states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington -- plus the District of Columbia that allow for recreational use.\n\nOther states' weed-related initiatives focused on medical marijuana; prior to the election, 31 states and the District of Columbia had laws that legalize or decriminalize it.\n\nMissouri had three medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot this year. Voters gave a definite yes to Amendment 2 , which legalizes medical marijuana, taxes it at 4% and guarantees that the money will be spent on health care services for veterans. Amendment 3 and Proposition C , which would also have legalized medical use but would have spent the tax revenue differently, failed.\n\nHealth care\n\nmostly Republican-dominated states, voted yes to expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level. In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase.

In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase.\n\ndoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion. Montana voters appear to be rejecting Medicaid expansion, but they are still counting votes on this initiative. Montana's I-185 would have also raised taxes on tobacco products to help fund the expansion and other health care programs. The tobacco industry has spent millions in the state to fight the initiative since it would havedoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion.\n\nOther health care initiatives were on the ballot in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada.\n\nauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Voters gave a resounding yes to California's Proposition 4 , which willauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Proposition 11 , which requires people who work on ambulances to stay on call during breaks and require employers to give EMTs and paramedics additional training and some paid mental health services.\n\nCalifornia voters rejected Proposition 8 , which would have required dialysis clinics to refund patients for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care.\n\nthe number of patients assigned to It appears that voters rejected Question 1 in Massachusetts that would have limitedthe number of patients assigned to registered nurses working in a hospital. The state has restrictions for intensive care units but not for any other part of the hospital.\n\nVoters seem to have said yes to Nevada's Question 4 , which requires the state legislature to remove taxes on durable medical equipment, oxygen equipment and mobility devices that are prescribed by a licensed provider. And early results are in favor of Nevada's Question 2 that removes sales tax from feminine hygiene products.\n\nOther health matters\n\nIn Massachusetts, preliminary voting results with Question 3 seem to suggest voters said yes to keeping a law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public places like restaurants, stores, hotels and hospitals. There's no federal law that provides such protections for people who identify as transgender.\n\nSome of the other ballot initiatives involved tax collection.\n\nMaine's Question 1 would have created a payroll tax and non-wage income tax that would fund a home health care program, but preliminary results show that it failed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nrejected eliminated the option for a felony charge for the possession or use of drugs, would require the state to spend on programs that would include helping people get into drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, would create sentencing programs that involve drug rehab, and would prohibit courts from sending a person to prison for non-criminal probation violations.

Wade. But they are, at a minimum, signs of what's to come should the landmark Supreme Court case get overturned.\n\n\"In a world after Roe, the voters will finally get to decide what abortion policy they support,\" said anti-abortion activist Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America , in a written statement. \"In this election, we saw people getting ready for the day in which Roe becomes a footnote in history.\"\n\nWhat the laws say\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2, which passed with 61% of votes, amends the state's Constitution \"to declare and otherwise affirm that it is the public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children ... and to provide that the constitution of this state does not protect the right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\"\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1, which passed more narrowly with 52% of votes, states that \"Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\"\n\nOregonians shot down Measure 106, which would have prohibited the use of public funds to pay for abortions except in cases in which there's a federal requirement or when the procedure is deemed \"medically necessary.\" Only 37% of voters voted for the measure, while 63% came out in opposition.\n\nWhat advocates say\n\nAnti-abortion activists were quick to applaud voters who came out against abortion and using taxpayer dollars -- like Medicaid -- to pay for abortions.\n\n\"West Virginians value life and reject abortion on demand,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List , a national anti-abortion group that launched a campaign to support the state's measure. \"Amendment 1 could spare the lives of 1,500 unborn West Virginians every year.\"\n\nAlthough the West Virginia amendment \"won't have an immediate impact,\" Julie Warden, a spokeswoman for the Vote No campaign, warned in an emailed statement that \"it is ominous for low-income women who already face insurmountable barriers to healthcare.\"\n\nShe added that options are being considered \"to ensure every West Virginian can get safe abortion care,\" no matter the amount they earn.\n\nThe Alabama amendment too \"has no immediate effect,\" said Kelly Krause, spokeswoman for the legal advocacy group Center for Reproductive Rights , but \"it sets the stage for Alabama to criminalize abortion without exception should Roe be overturned. By giving the same rights to a fetus as a person, this measure could have far-reaching consequences for contraception and in-vitro-fertilization as well. For example, emergency contraception like Plan B could be banned and couples undergoing fertility treatments could be forced to pay for the upkeep of their frozen embryos forever.\"\n\nDr. Brandi Shah, a family medicine physician in Alabama who's on the faculty of Physicians for Reproductive Health , called the amendments \"back door bans against abortion\" and warned what this could mean in if the protection of Roe v. Wade is lost.\n\n\"In Alabama, at a state level, a person's right to health care -- in this case abortion -- has been lost,\" she said in a written statement. \"The right to make life-changing decisions about pregnancy has been taken away from pregnant people even in extenuating cases of rape, incest, or risk to the life of a woman.\"\n\nThe passage of the two measures left Dr. Willie Parker, an ob/gyn, abortion provider and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, \"heartbroken for my patients and the people of Alabama and West Virginia.\"\n\n\"Abortion is health care, health care is a right,\" he said in a news release, \"and a right is not a right if every patient can't afford to access it.\"\n\nBeyond the bills\n\nThe hot-button issue of abortion extended beyond ballot measures; it helped drive support and interpretation of candidates. In this regard, both sides of the debate chose to declare victory.\n\nA representative from Americans United for Life pointed in a statement to election results in three states -- North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana -- as a positive sign.\n\n\"Voters swept Democratic senators out of office who voted against pro-life Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh,\" said Steven Aden, the anti-abortion group's chief legal officer and general counsel. \"The net result is now a strong pro-life majority in the Senate,\" which he hopes will lead to the confirmation of more anti-abortion federal judges and the passage of bills like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban late-term abortions nationwide.\n\nBut Planned Parenthood declared Tuesday's election results \"a huge victory for reproductive health and rights\" in a news release. \"Voters around the country flipped the U.S. House of Representatives to a pro-reproductive health majority, and key reproductive health champions were elected statewide,\" including the governors-elect in Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico.\n\nNewly elected officials in the mix means both sides are preparing for what's to come.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThose on the anti-abortion side vow that they will not be complacent, especially as they \"face the reality of a now pro-abortion led House of Representatives that is determined to thwart President Trump's pro-life policy agenda,\" said Dannenfelser, of the Susan B.

That includes the granting of monopolies and exclusive franchises for the generation of electricity.\n\nThose in support of the question argued that \"without an open market, it is difficult for Nevadans to take advantage of new technologies in energy generation,\" such as renewable resources. Retail electricity markets are determined at the state level. They can be traditionally regulated, in which consumers cannot choose who generates their power and are required to purchase from the utility in that area, or they can be competitive, in which consumers choose between competitive retail suppliers.\n\nThe ballot question was rejected by 67.11% of voters, according to the secretary of state's general election results website\n\nNevada's State Question No. 6 asked voters whether the state Constitution should be amended to require that all utility service providers that sell electricity generate or acquire incrementally larger percentages of it from renewable resources -- so that, by 2030, at least half of electricity sold by each provider comes from renewable energy resources.

Most respondents said they \"believed that teaching individuals to vote was important and worthwhile and that instructional materials could be prepared that would allow people ... to understand varying political platforms or positions on at least some political issues.\"\n\nSome respondents also expressed concerns, saying they were \"mindful of the time requirements and the potential for personal bias to influence the instructional process.\"\n\nSenator said she guides all three of her sons as a parent would, and only one has a diagnosis of autism. Her family doesn't always agree on everything, she said -- but one of the things that's different about Batchelder is that \"he's a very black-and-white thinker.\" In order to have those conversations, she finds ways to be clear and concrete about issues that impact his everyday life.\n\nFor example, support from Medicaid allows Batchelder to live in an apartment with caregivers and lead an active life, playing sports, singing in a rock band, volunteering and recycling at a high school, Senator said.\n\nBatchelder sings at a Special Olympics event in Marlborough, Massachusetts, in August 2017.\n\nFor many people with disabilities, \"their livelihood depends on their health care,\" said Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n\n\"They have arguably more at stake than many of us.\"\n\n'Nobody should be invisible'\n\nA number of states have requirements that voters be \"competent\" in order to vote, which can have the effect of stripping away the right to vote from people with certain disabilities, Mathis said.\n\nThe US Election Assistance Commission keeps data on voters removed from registration rolls due to \"mental incompetency,\" but it's hard to say exactly how many people across the country have been prevented from voting due to disability, she added.\n\n\"Our problem with those laws is that they hold people with disabilities to a higher standard than all other voters,\" Mathis said.\n\nAccording to this year's voting rights guide led by the Bazelon Center, 40 states and the District of Columbia have policies in state constitutions or election laws that could restrict someone's right to vote if they have such a disability.\n\nOften, these policies are based on guardianship status, Mathis said, which may have been imposed after a single episode in which the person was in crisis -- as with someone who didn't take their medications or who didn't have access to services they needed.\n\n\"The consequence of that: The person is now living with the inability to make decisions about basic things for the rest of their life,\" she said.\n\nMore restrictive state policies might prevent people under guardianship from voting, while other states have less restrictive policies or ones that are difficult to enforce. Some \"middle-ground\" states might require some sort of challenge in order to prove \"competence\" -- for example, by answering questions about the governor's name or issues on the ballot, Mathis added.\n\n\"We don't expect that of voters without disabilities. We don't scrutinize the rationality of their choices,\" she said.\n\n\"I think if you ask the average voter on the street some of the questions that people with disabilities get asked in these guardianship proceedings, they wouldn't be able to answer them.\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, where Batchelder lives, people with intellectual disabilities can vote in elections unless that person's guardianship specifically states that they can't vote.\n\nSeven states' laws also use \"outmoded and stigmatizing terms\" such as \"idiots,\" \"insane persons\" and \"of unsound mind,\" according to the Bazelon Center guide.\n\n\"Even though the laws evolve over time and they may get better in some ways, it takes a very long time to get away from these fundamental views of people with disabilities as incapable,\" Mathis said. \"That's the biggest stereotype of people with disabilities.\"\n\nShe questioned why we need a voter competence standard at all, especially when 10 states have no such standard. \"The way that we know that people are competent to vote is if they show up to vote and they want to make a choice,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHowever, barriers to voting go beyond which laws are on the books, experts say. Some people may lack transportation, not know how to use the voting equipment, feel discouraged from failed attempts in the past or have a physical disability that makes a polling place inaccessible to them, according to one report\n\nBut for Batchelder, who proudly wore an \"I Voted\" sticker after casting his ballot Thursday, \"everything from start to finish was so nice -- and so easy,\" Senator said.\n\nThe polling workers sensed that he was different from some of the other voters, Senator said, \"and they immediately took Nat under their wing. And I was just so touched about that.\"\n\n\"Just because someone has a diagnosis of developmental disability, that should not disqualify someone,\" she said. \"Nobody should be invisible.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Trump fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46132348", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:03:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP\n\nUS Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been fired by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!\" Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nThe president had repeatedly criticised his top law enforcement official after he recused himself from the Russia investigation dogging the White House.\n\nMr Trump said Mr Sessions will be temporarily replaced by his chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who has criticised the Russia inquiry.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump ....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!

In April 2017, he wrote for CNN that any Mueller investigation into the president's finances would be \"going too far\".\n\nWhat happens next is critical. Mr Mueller's inquiry could continue unabated - although the special counsel must surely be considering tightening his timeline. There is also the possibility, however, that this is just the opening move of a White House effort to shut down the probe or keep its findings out of the public eye.\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nDemocrats were outraged by the attorney general's removal, with the Democratic National Committee noting that the appointee has not been confirmed for the role by the US Senate as required.\n\nThe party's Senate leader Chuck Schumer tweeted: \"Clearly, the President has something to hide.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @EricHolder Anyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable.

Donald Trump had previously said he would wait until after the mid-term elections to decide his attorney general's fate, and he did - but just barely.\n\nAnd like that the duties of overseeing Robert Mueller's Russia investigation shift from the man who appointed the special counsel, Rod Rosenstein, to a man who has been a critic of it, Department of Justice Chief-of-Staff Matthew Whitaker.\n\nIn an opinion piece for The Hill before he took the Department of Justice chief of staff job, Mr Whitaker wrote that calls for an as yet-to-be-named independent prosecutor would be \"just craven attempts to score cheap political points\". In April 2017, he wrote for CNN that any Mueller investigation into the president's finances would be \"going too far\".\n\nWhat happens next is critical. Mr Mueller's inquiry could continue unabated - although the special counsel must surely be considering tightening his timeline. There is also the possibility, however, that this is just the opening move of a White House effort to shut down the probe or keep its findings out of the public eye.\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nDemocrats were outraged by the attorney general's removal, with the Democratic National Committee noting that the appointee has not been confirmed for the role by the US Senate as required.\n\nThe party's Senate leader Chuck Schumer tweeted: \"Clearly, the President has something to hide.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @EricHolder Anyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable.

February 2014 and April 2017, before being sacked for gross misconduct.\n\nThe 35-year-old from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, has denied the claims.\n\nLegal papers lodged at Airdrie Sheriff Court allege

Donaldson.\n\nShe had a meeting with an accountant to discuss use of the card and was suspended.\n\nMs Rowling has alleged Ms Donaldson made a series of unauthorised payments, including:\n\n\u00a3823

But some member states want extra guarantees on rules and regulations if they are to offer the UK quota-free and tariff-free access to the single market.\n\nSome question if it's legally possible to agree during the Brexit talks instead of in the detailed negotiations over the future relationship that will begin after exit day.\n\nOthers fret that they're being kept in the dark by the EU negotiators. But Brussels is united on two issues: the ultimate insurance policy remains a Northern Ireland-only element to the backstop, and the UK can't decide to withdraw from it on its own.\n\nBoth sides agreed to put in place a \"backstop\", also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a frictionless border.\n\nThis is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.\n\nOne option for the backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border.\n\nBut how long this would last, and how the arrangement could be terminated, has not yet been settled.\n\nThe government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work.\n\nMeanwhile, former prime minister David Cameron has said he \"fully supports\" his successor's handling of the process.\n\nSpeaking ahead of a visit to the Treasury, where he was to look at documents for his memoirs, Mr Cameron said the prime minister should be \"left to get on\" with negotiating a deal."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Majority of MSPs support having another vote on Brexit", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46124611", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:03:51", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA Image caption Hundreds of thousands of people marched through London calling for a new vote on Brexit\n\nMSPs have voted to express their \"unequivocal support\" for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit.\n\nHolyrood voted by 65 to 30 in favour of such a move during a debate about the impact of leaving the EU.\n\nSNP, Green and Lib Dem MSPs were joined by two Scottish Labour members in the vote, while the bulk of the Labour group abstained.\n\nThe UK government is firmly opposed to having a new referendum, saying the 2016 vote must be respected.\n\nCampaigners have been calling a fresh public vote on whatever Brexit deal the UK hammers out with the EU, with hundreds of thousands of marchers taking to the streets of London in October to demand this.\n\nNicola Sturgeon confirmed in October that SNP MPs would support such a vote if the question were put to them at Westminster.\n\nBut this is the first time MSPs have put their views down on the record in a Holyrood vote, even on a symbolic motion.\n\nThe debate -

A third hand stencil - an example of abstract, rather than figurative art - had a maximum age of 51,800 years, even older than the animal painting.\n\nThe authors conclude that rock art locally developed in Borneo between around 52,000 and 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe second phase of painting in the cave is characterised by the use of purple-coloured paint, and dates to between 16,000 and 21,000 years ago. This phase includes some apparent depictions of humans.\n\nMaxime Aubert said: \"It looks like there was a transition from depicting the animal world to [depicting] the human world.

They contain images of a veritable prehistoric menagerie, including cave lions, hyenas, horses, deer, rhinos and bison.\n\nBut a paper published earlier this year in the journal Science pushed the dates for cave art in Europe back to as much as 65,000 years. These paintings pre-date the known arrival of modern humans in Europe, leading to the study's suggestion that they might have been made by Neanderthals.\n\nOne of the authors of that paper in Science was Prof Alistair Pike, an archaeologist from the University of Southampton. Prof Pike - who was not involved with the new research - welcomed the findings, but expressed reservations about the date for the oldest figurative painting.\n\n\"I have no doubt that they have dated painting to at least 40,000 years at their oldest site, and this is an exciting result as it shows that cave painting wasn't an isolated event... but that it had a wide geographical distribution,\" Prof Pike explained.\n\nImage copyright Pindi Setiawan Image caption The caves also contain paintings of humans; these ones date to 13,600 years ago\n\n\"But there are some doubts if their dated sample overlies the figurative art... it appears to lie over some pigment 15cm away from the animal figure, and while it once might have formed part of this figure (which is very weathered), they have not demonstrated it is part of it.\"\n\nProf d'Errico also sounded a note of caution, explaining that the discovery didn't tell us much about the geographical origins of art.\n\n\"I think things develop independently. There may be other areas where people were producing something similar but we haven't found it yet, or that it wasn't preserved,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I think that symbolic thinking and abstract representation have a long history.

Most efforts have failed.\n\nAssuming ExoMars can overcome this hurdle, it will use a package of instruments to look for signs of past or present life, employing a drill to extend the search below the harsh conditions that persist at the planet's surface.\n\nThe meeting at Leicester's university has been convened by the European Space Agency (Esa) and comprises senior academics and officials from industry.

Great scientific prospects count for nothing if you cannot land the robot in one piece.\n\nEurope's previous touch-down effort, the Schiaparelli mission, crashed into Mars' surface in 2016 when the probe's onboard computer became confused about its altitude during the descent and switched off the braking thrusters far too early.\n\nSchiaparelli smacked into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nExoMars will be using a similar entry, descent and landing strategy that incorporates a capsule, a parachute system and retro-rockets.\n\nA factor that will bear heavily on the Leicester discussions is the knowledge that Oxia is at a much lower elevation than Mawrth - by about 1,000m. This would give the descending robot's parachute much longer to bite Mars' thin atmosphere and slow the supersonic approach towards the surface.\n\nWhat else has to be thought about?\n\nIn addition, Mawrth's position is slightly to the north of Oxia.\n\nThe angle of approach required to get to this higher latitude necessarily produces greater uncertainty in the eventual touch-down point.\n\nEngineers talk of confidence zones that are elliptical in shape. For both locations these ellipses are 19km wide, but, in the case of Mawrth, the length is 190km. For Oxia, it's 104km.\n\nHigh-resolution satellite images have been acquired of both sites.\n\nThese will have been examined for hazards such as steep slopes and deep gullies, and also for the preponderance of large boulders. ExoMars will come down on its Russian-built lander.

This software will enable ExoMars to find its own way across the ground without the constant intervention of engineers back on Earth, and should speed up dramatically its ability to survey scientifically interesting places to drill.\n\nWhen do we get a decision?\n\nAmerica is also sending a rover to Mars in 2020. This is, broadly speaking, a copy of the Curiosity rover, although it will have different instrumentation and seek to find rock samples it cache for later return to Earth laboratories.\n\nAs with ExoMars, this mission is going through a site selection process.

The European Space Agency (Esa) and industry did a tremendous job to put all the spacecraft parts - in terms of payload module, service module and instruments - into a shape where they're ready for launch.\"\n\nAll three platforms in the Metop series were purchased from European industry at the turn of the millennium. It is the most efficient and cheapest way to acquire these multi-billion-euro systems.\n\nMetop-A was the first to launch, in 2006; Metop-B followed in 2012. Both satellites were expected to work for at least five years, and their continued operation today is a boon to weather forecasters. They will now get additional data to ingest in numerical models with the launch of Metop-C.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Metop-C being prepared for launch at the European spaceport in French Guiana\n\nThe satellites are different from their geostationary spacecraft \"cousins\" which image developing weather activity from a vantage point some 36,000km above the equator.\n\nThe polar orbiting satellites fly much lower, only 800km above the ground. Their job is to probe atmospheric conditions, detailing parameters such as humidity and temperature at different heights.\n\nThe introduction of the Metops has had an astounding impact on forecast quality. Assessments indicate the data from the first two platforms reduced errors in the 24-hour lookahead by 27%. And there have been big gains also in medium-range forecasts - those that go out to several days hence.\n\nEumetsat operates Europe's weather spacecraft from its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. But the satellites' design and procurement is overseen by Esa. It is currently working on Metop-SG (Second Generation).\n\nThese spacecraft will have much more advanced instrumentation, and in a change to the current observing strategy - those instruments will be deployed across pairs of platforms.\n\nImage caption The Microwave Humidity Sounders were batch-bought\n\nThe British MHS will be succeeded by the MicroWave Sounder (MWS). It will have significantly improved performance.\n\nThe first Metop-SG pairing is set to roll out at the end of 2022.\n\nThese are interesting times in satellite meteorology because we are starting to see very small spacecraft being launched to monitor the state of the atmosphere. The new platforms are shoebox-sized, versus the 4-tonne Goliaths like Metop.\n\n\"New space\" companies - good examples would include Spire and Orbital Micro Systems - are looking to sell weather data and forecasts to private clients.\n\nDr Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at Esa, told BBC News that his agency was evaluating the data from smallsats but it was too early to say how these novel systems would eventually fit into the general observing system.\n\n\"One should be careful not to make simple comparisons between the quality of a smallsat with a big sat,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes the illusion is created that you can just replace the big ones with the small ones. Smallsats provide what they are designed for - to be small, to be quick and for there to be many of them. Their measurements are therefore complementary to the more precise data from classical satellites like Metop.\"\n\nMetop-C lifted off on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Kourou spaceport on schedule at 21:47 local time, Tuesday (00:47 GMT Wednesday).\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Pistachio-Eating Man Achieves \u2018Flow\u2019 State", "article_link": "https://local.theonion.com/pistachio-eating-man-achieves-flow-state-1830289137", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:16", "body_paragraphs": "CHULA VISTA, CA\u2014Awed and profoundly moved after witnessing such Zen-like serenity and focus, sources close to pistachio-eater Lawrence Carmichael confirmed Wednesday that he had achieved a complete \u201cflow\u201d state while snacking on the shelled seeds. \u201cI believe his consciousness tuned out all extraneous stimuli or phenomena until his entire universe became encompassed by that simple bowl of nuts,\u201d said astonished onlooker Ryan Martinez, who claimed to have \u201cglimpsed a brief yet somehow boundless flicker of eternity\u201d in the mesmerizing rhythm of Carmichael\u2019s opening of the culinary nuts, consumption of the delicious nutmeats, and discarding of the shells, during which his motions echoed the movements of the planets in their orbits and the very stars in their heavenly courses. \u201cThis is unbelievable.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:29", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:35", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump: Second Summit with North Korea's Kim in Early 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-second-summit-with-north-korea-s-kim-in-early-2019/4649070.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:38", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump says he expects to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again sometime early next year and that his administration is \"happy\" with diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang.\n\n\"We think it's going fine.

The statement did not give a reason why the meeting was called off.\n\nThe talks in New York were largely seen as paving the way for a second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un, who met in Singapore in June.\n\nAt a White House press conference, the president said Pompeo's meeting with Kim Yong Chol will be rescheduled.\n\n\"We are going to make it another day,\" he said.\n\nAt the State Department on Wednesday, deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino said the postponement \"is purely a scheduling issue.\"\n\n\"We're in a pretty good place right now.

North Korea is also seeking a peace treaty with the United States and South Korea that will formally end the 1950-53 Korean War that split the communist North from the democratic South.\n\nInter-Korean relations\n\nWhile both the U.S. and South Korea all want peace and stability in the Korea peninsula, there is a \"fear\" that fast-developing inter-Korean relations may get out of step with Washington, according to former U.S. officials and experts.\n\n\"The fear from America's perspective would be that the South Koreans might go too fast and agree to things that would involve, for example, our troops, our economic postures that we wouldn't be prepared to give [at this stage], without perhaps getting significant concessions on reductions of weapons testing,\" retired U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenney said Wednesday.\n\n\"You could have a situation that South Korea and North Korea come to some kind of agreement and then suddenly there's an expectation that we would fall into line with that we would be willing to put scarce budget dollars into helping North Korea economically, you know, without having laid the groundwork or gotten enough concessions to make that possible,\" Kenney said at an Asia Society event that discussed U.S. policy toward Asia after the midterm elections.\n\n\"Keeping these things in sync is always a challenge,\" said former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Danny Russel.\n\n\"It's a lot easier when the North Koreans are misbehaving, that tends to promote solidarity between Washington and Seoul,\" Russel said. \"When the North Koreans are seemingly opening the door, then those differences in priorities and perspective can create tensions.\"\n\n\"The immediate priorities of reconciliation, family visit, and potential for infrastructure and trade between North and South [Korea] look a lot different from Seoul and from Washington as does the global non-proliferation agenda,\" he added."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Tech, Health Care Lead US Stock Surge After Midterms", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-health-care-lead-us-stock-surge-after-midterms/4649056.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:38", "body_paragraphs": "Stocks rallied Wednesday as investors were relieved to see that the U.S. midterm elections went largely as they expected they would.

It's not clear how the divided Congress will work with Republican President Donald Trump, but if the possibilities for compromise and big agenda items seem limited, Wall Street is fine with that because it means politics is that much less likely to crowd out the performance of the strong U.S. economy.\n\n\n\n\"The market likes when what it expects to happen happens,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief markets strategist for TD Ameritrade. \"We haven't had that happen in a little while, when you think about major events like Brexit or the presidential election.\"\n\n\n\nThe S&P 500 index climbed 58.44 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,813.89.

Three-fourths of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange traded higher.\n\n\n\nHistorically markets have performed well after midterm elections and with split control of Congress.\n\n\n\nStocks are off to a strong start in November, and the S&P 500 is up 3.8 percent so far this month. That follows a swoon in October that knocked the S&P 500 down nearly 7 percent as investors worried about rising interest rates and the U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\n\n\nHigh-growth stocks took an especially brutal beating last month. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said it will be worth watching to see if investors are willing to buy those stocks again or if they continue to prefer slower-growing, more \"defensive\" companies like utilities and household goods makers.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday investors bet on growth. Amazon jumped 6.9 percent to $1,755.49 and Microsoft gained 3.9 percent to $111.96, while Google's parent company, Alphabet, picked up 3.6 percent to $1,108.24.\n\n\n\nSteady, \"defensive\" stocks lagged the rest of the stock market. Those companies, which include utilities and household goods makers, tend to do well when stocks are in turmoil, but they're less appealing when investors are betting on economic growth.\n\n\n\nIndustrial companies made strong gains, but they didn't do as well as the rest of the market. While some investors hope that Trump and Congressional leadership will pass an infrastructure stimulus bill, they've had those hopes dashed more than once since he took office.\n\n\n\nIt's not clear how the elections will affect the Trump policy Wall Street might be most concerned about: the trade dispute with China. Trump has imposed taxes of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports and threatened additional tariffs on top of those. Beijing has responded with tariffs on $110 billion of American goods.\n\n\n\nA primary concern in Asia is the potential for trade tensions to hobble growth for export-reliant economies.\n\n\n\nEconomists at S&P Global, Oxford Economics and the Bank of America all agreed that government gridlock will likely result from the Democrats winning control of the House. But they don't think a stalemate will automatically hinder economic growth.\n\n\n\nIt's more likely that government will play less of a role in spurring economic growth in 2019 and 2020. As a result, the health of the global economy, interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and spending by U.S. consumers and companies will have a bigger impact on determining the pace of growth.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also meeting Wednesday and Thursday. It's not expected to raise interest rates this month, but investors believe it will do so in December.\n\n\n\nBanks also didn't rise as much other stocks. Republicans had discussed a new round of tax cuts if they maintained full control over Congress, which would have expanded the government's deficits further and required it to issue more debt. Government bond yields spiked overnight after a batch of strong early results for some GOP candidates, but then headed lower as Democrats' fortunes improved, making a new tax cut package unlikely.\n\n\n\nDemocrats' victory in the House also means that Rep. Maxine Waters will likely become chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the nation's banking system and its regulators. Waters has called for more regulation of banks, and has been vocal about Trump political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.\n\n\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly, to 3.22 percent. It spiked as high as 3.25 percent Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. dollar also weakened. The ICE US dollar index fell 0.2 percent. The U.S. currency fell to 113.34 yen from 113.40 yen, and the euro climbed to $1.1455 from $1.1413.\n\n\n\nMajor indexes in Europe climbed. The French CAC 40 jumped 1.2 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1.1 percent. The DAX in Germany rose 0.8 percent.\n\n\n\nOctober is historically a rough month for stocks, though markets usually rise after midterm elections regardless of how the political landscape may change because Wall Street is glad to have more certainty.\n\n\n\nDemocrats' win in the House means Republicans won't be able to take another shot at repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. Voters in Idaho and Nebraska all voted to expand Medicaid, and the winning gubernatorial candidates in Maine and Kansas also favor expanding Medicaid benefits. Voting on a Medicaid expansion proposition in Utah was too close to call.\n\n\n\nHealth insurers, hospital operators and Medicaid program operators all jumped. UnitedHealth gained 4.2 percent to $274.63 and hospital company HCA added 4.7 percent to $141.65. Molina, a provider of Medicaid-related services, surged 10.5 percent to $137.32.\n\n\n\nMarijuana stocks jumped after Michigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana and Utah and Missouri voters approved medical marijuana measures. The stocks rose even further after the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who promoted more aggressive enforcement of those laws. Tilray vaulted 30.6 percent to $139.60 and Canopy Growth rose 8.2 percent to $46.07.\n\n\n\nOil prices continued to fall. U.S. crude lost 0.9 percent to $61.67, and Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, dipped 0.1 percent to $72.07 a barrel in London.\n\n\n\nWholesale gasoline lost 2.8 percent to $1.65 a gallon and heating oil rose 2.2 percent to $2.24 a gallon. Natural gas was unchanged at $3.56 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\n\n\nGold rose 0.2 percent to $1,228.70 an ounce. Silver picked up 0.5 percent to $14.57 an ounce. Copper added 0.8 percent to $2.75 a pound.\n\n\n\nIn Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent while South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent.

But the chasing got harder and harder, and now he spends his time making nets for other fishermen at his workshop, at the end of a dirt path next to his ex-wife's house.\n\nThe house is on CB Daniels Sr. Road, one of several named after two of the fishing clans that have held sway for decades in this small coastal town. Besides CB Daniels Sr. Road, there's ER Daniels Road and just plain Daniels Road. In Frog's family, there's Tink Tillett Road and Rondal Tillett Road.\n\nOnce upon a time, these fishing families were pioneers. In the 1970s and 1980s, they built summer flounder into a major catch for the region. The 15 brothers and sisters of the Daniels clan parlayed the business into a multinational fishing company, and three years ago they sold it to a Canadian outfit for tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBut for Frog Tillett and almost everyone else in these parts, there's not much money to be made fishing offshore here anymore.\n\nForty years ago, Tillett fished for summer flounder in December and January in waters near Wanchese, then followed the fish north as the weather warmed. In recent years, however, fewer summer flounder have traveled as far south in the winter, and the most productive area has shifted north, closer to Martha's Vineyard and the southern shore of Long Island.\n\nReuters has spent more than a year scouring decades of maritime temperature readings, fishery records and other little-used data to create a portrait of the planet's hidden climate disruption \u2014 in the rarely explored depths of the seas that cover more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface. The reporting has come to a disturbing conclusion: Marine life is facing an epic dislocation.\n\nThe U.S. North Atlantic is a prime example. In recent years, at least 85 percent of the nearly 70 federally tracked species there had shifted north or deeper, or both, when compared to the norm over the past half-century, according to the Reuters analysis of U.S. fisheries data. But this great migration is not just off the coast of America. Pushed out of their traditional habitats by the dramatically rising ocean temperatures and other fallout from climate change, summer flounder are part of a global disruption of marine species that threatens livelihoods, cultures and the delicate balance of the oceans themselves.\n\nA mirror image of the flotillas of desperate people trying to escape deadly conflicts, this is a refugee crisis going on beneath the surface of the seas. And much of it has happened in the time it took a child to be born and graduate from high school.\n\nTillett, threading lead weights onto the bottom of a net, remembers the days of plenty up and down the Atlantic coast, catching summer flounder up north but knowing there were plenty more back home.\n\n\"Then, all of a sudden, everything starts moving that way, and nothing is left down here.\"\n\n'There ain't no flounder around here no more'\n\nFew tourists traveling on Route 64 from the North Carolina mainland to the Hatteras beaches venture into Wanchese.\n\nIt isn't even a town, officially. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, says 1,600 people live here, many of them in one-story cinder-block homes, not the big beach houses on stilts, known euphemistically as cottages, a few miles away.\n\nMost mornings, Danielses and Tilletts and Etheridges, another of the fishing clans, crowd the restaurant down by the marina.\n\nLongtime flounder skipper Steve Daniels pulls up. Steve bought his first trawler in 1978 and started flounder fishing that summer. That was the year Wanchese fishermen decided there was money in the fish. In 1977, they had caught zero pounds. In 1978, they caught 12 million pounds, and in 1979, their catch approached 17 million pounds. And that doesn't count the millions of pounds they landed during the warmer months in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey ports.\n\nOver the years, however, the longer trips north needed to find the fish, among other factors, made the fishing increasingly unprofitable.\n\n\"There ain't no flounder around here no more \u2014 they all up there in Rhode Island,\" Steve says. \"I got the hell out of it three years ago.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, summer flounder stocks were on the verge of collapse after being overfished in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily by Wanchese and other North Carolina fishermen.\n\nToday, after years of severe limits on catches, the species is relatively healthy. Unfortunately for Wanchese, it has rebounded in an area well north of where the crews here started fishing for summer flounder.\n\nBut that hasn't made a difference to arcane rules on summer flounder catches.\n\nNearly a quarter-century ago, when the fishermen of Wanchese were riding high, the U.S. government set quotas for summer flounder. It dictated that about a quarter of all the flounder caught in U.S. waters must be \"landed,\" or brought to shore, in North Carolina, no matter where they were caught.\n\nSome modest changes being considered for next year could reduce North Carolina's landings to one-fifth of the national total. But the very makeup of federal fishery-management bodies has stymied greater changes.\n\nSummer flounder is managed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, one of three federally mandated councils that operate along the East Coast. Each council has about 20 members made up of fishermen, scientists, regulators, ecologists and a strong bloc of wholesale fish dealers. The councils' size and the members' competing interests make them slow to act. And often, the fishermen and especially the dealers are reluctant to shift an economic benefit from one region to another, as in the case of summer flounder, whose stock has shifted away from mid-Atlantic waters.\n\nKiley Dancy, a fishery management specialist with the mid-Atlantic council, says there has been much resistance to shifting the landings to states closer to where the fish are now located.\n\n\"Many would like for it to stay the same,\" she says. The proposed changes, she says, \"better reflect the location of the biomass\" \u2014 that is, the area where the species is most likely to be found.\n\nIf adopted, the changes could take effect in late 2019 or early 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, summer flounder continue their inexorable move north. Is it, as with so many other species, because of the warming of the water?\n\n\"Absolutely. Looking at the data panorama, actually, I think this is fairly well established. I think that any intelligent conversation kind of starts with that just as a matter of fact,\" says Joel Fodrie of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina.\n\nRutgers University fish ecologist Malin Pinsky has been studying how fisheries have shifted around the North Atlantic for the better part of a decade. It was his work, adapting federal trawler sampling dating to 1968, that first identified where the centers of various species were located and illustrated the wholesale shift of species north.\n\nPinsky is well aware that fish, which can swim wherever they want, live in complex ecosystems, and attributing those shifts simply to climate change would be oversimplifying matters.\n\nStill, he says, his work shows that temperature change is almost certainly the single largest factor. In 2013, he published a research paper that calculated that 40 percent of the northerly shift was attributed to temperature change.\n\n\"Actually, that's impressively high ... that something as simple as temperature explained a lot of the pattern, given that there's fishing, there's predators, there's prey, de-oxygenation, pollution and changing currents. There's so much going on.\"\n\nIn the case of flounder, the slow rebuilding of the stock has also resulted in a more mature population than the one that existed in the 1980s, according to trawling surveys conducted by the federal government. And older and larger summer flounder tend to live farther north than younger fish, says Fodrie, the UNC professor, who's been working these waters for the better part of 20 years.\n\nRegulators vs. fishermen\n\nAmong the Wanchese breakfast crowd, few names elicit a lengthier string of expletives than Louis Daniel, former executive director of the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries. Many fishermen feel he imposed overly strict management of the local catches when he was in charge.\n\nDaniel, unrelated to the Daniels family, knows he is an unpopular man among commercial fishermen. \"They think I wanted to put them out of business, that profit should always be put ahead of protecting the resource,\" he says.\n\nBut, he says, there is little doubt that there are fewer fish in this region than there once were. And some species have clearly been affected by climate change in the region.\n\nConsider striped bass, which he says is a perfect example of how climate change can dislocate fisheries management.\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when recreational anglers routinely caught striped bass along the beaches in North Carolina. But since the beginning of the century, the number of striped bass has steadily declined.\n\n\"North Carolina has not caught any striped bass in five or six years or more,\" he says. \"There has been nothing on the beach.\"\n\nThey are, however, routinely found in Canadian waters, which was unheard of a generation ago.\n\nIn early 2010, a small population of the fish was still wintering off the Carolina coast. Steve Daniels took his trawler three miles offshore into federal waters. Over a 10-day period, he illegally caught about 12,000 pounds of striped bass, landing the fish here in Wanchese, according to the United States Attorney's Office.\n\nLast August, Steve pleaded guilty to the charges and agreed to pay $95,000 in restitution. He was sentenced to five years' probation.\n\nGambles pay off\n\nThrough the years, the families in Wanchese haven't been afraid to gamble on a hunch.\n\nMikey Daniels was in high school when a local named Willie Etheridge Jr. decided to make a go at longlining for swordfish.\n\n\"That was '63, '64,\" he says. \"We were stacking them up like cordwood. I mean, three or four hundred fish in a stack, and they did it by hand.\"\n\nOn Dec. 23, 1970, however, the Food and Drug Administration announced that tests showed that swordfish flesh was tainted with extremely high levels of mercury, a toxic metal. And overnight, the swordfish boom went bust.\n\nIt took a few years, but Wanchese's entrepreneurial fishermen got to work on summer flounder. This time it was Mikey's father, Malcolm Daniels, who took the lead, after struggling for years. At one point, Mikey remembers, his father was so poor there was a collection in town to raise money to help the family.\n\nEventually, though, his father bought a 65-foot wooden boat that he converted into a trawler that could drag large nets behind it. And before long, he was buying metal shrimp boats from Texas and converting them to trawlers too.\n\nThe family also added a trucking company to drive fish to New York and Boston.\n\n\"I was 16 years old driving tractor-trailers. My brothers were too,\" he says. \"We would get to New York, traveling in a group, you know.\n\nThe Daniels siblings took over the Wanchese Seafood Company when their father died in 1986. By the time their mother died in 2006, the family had expanded into boats and seafood wholesalers in Virginia, Massachusetts, Alaska and Argentina. When they sold up, they all became millionaires \u2014 a rarity in Wanchese.\n\nThe Wanchese fishermen fought hard for their place in the flounder business, but they started fading this decade.\n\nIn 2013, fishermen from North Carolina accounted for 64 percent of the summer flounder landed in the state, down from 80 percent just a few years earlier.\n\nBy 2016, it was less than half. Fishermen from New Jersey and Massachusetts accounted for 35 percent that year, up from nothing a decade earlier.\n\nA winner in New England\n\nOn a cold December day hundreds of miles north of Wanchese, snow whips through the New Bedford, Mass., fishing fleet. The wind howls and bangs through the rigging of the boats docked two or three deep along the city's working piers.\n\nMost of the boats are dark. But the Sao Paulo's wheelhouse glows orange. Inside, skipper Antonio Borges is preparing to leave as soon as the weather breaks.\n\nThe 60-year-old has just returned from 11 days at sea. It could have been a three-day trip if he were allowed to land his catch in Massachusetts, but the law prohibits that.\n\nInstead, he left New Bedford and steamed less than a day before reaching the waters south of Long Island. He dragged his nets in about 50 fathoms of water and filled his hold with summer flounder. Then he turned south for a couple of days to offload some fish in Virginia. Two days after that, he offloaded flounder at the Beaufort, N.C., docks, before turning around and heading home.\n\nA day after tying up in New Bedford, he's back on the boat getting ready to go to sea.\n\nBorges is fortunate that he can even catch the summer flounder: He bought landing permits from North Carolina and Virginia fishermen. In a perfect world, he says, Massachusetts and other New England and mid-Atlantic states would have a bigger quota.\n\nStill, Borges says he doesn't mind. He owns a boat large enough to make those trips, even in the foulest of winter weather. And besides, he's invested in the status quo \u2014 he paid for one of those landing permits.\n\nSo, even though his time on the seas would be much shorter, he said the distributions of landings shouldn't change. \"It's not going to happen, and it shouldn't happen,\" he says. \"Because the states that we bought the license from, we already knew that we had to go to those states and deliver the fish.\"\n\nTraveling the distance from the Northeast to North Carolina benefits fishermen like Borges in bigger boats.

Mishra, director of power systems at the government Solar Energy Corporation of India.\n\nIndia is planning new large-scale installations of the technology on hydropower reservoirs and other water bodies in Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand states, and in the Lakshadweep islands, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"The cost is coming almost to the same level as ground solar, and then it will go (forward) very fast,\" he predicted.\n\nAs countries move to swiftly scale up solar power, to meet growing demand for energy and to try to curb climate change, floating solar panels - installed on reservoirs or along coastal areas - are fast gaining popularity, particularly in Asia, experts say.\n\nThe panels - now in place from China to the Maldives to Britain - get around some of the biggest problems facing traditional solar farms, particularly a lack of available land, said Oliver Knight, a senior energy specialist with the World Bank.\n\n\"The water body is already there - you don't need to go out and find it,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nAnd siting solar arrays on water - most cover up to 10 percent of a reservoir - can cut evaporation as well, a significant benefit in water-short places, Knight said.\n\nPakistan's new government, for instance, is talking about using floating solar panels on water reservoirs near Karachi and Hyderabad, both to provide much-needed power and to curb water losses as climate change brings hotter temperatures and more evaporation, he said.\n\nSolar arrays on hydropower dams also can take advantage of existing power transmission lines, and excess solar can be used to pump water, effectively storing it as hydropower potential.\n\nBig Potential\n\nChina currently has the most of the 1.1 gigawatts of floating solar generating capacity now installed, according to the World Bank.\n\nBut the technology's potential is much bigger - about 400 gigawatts, or about as much generating capacity as all the solar photovoltaic panels installed in the world through 2017, the bank said.\n\n\"If you covered 1 percent of manmade water bodies, you're already looking at 400 gigawatts,\" Knight said. \"That's very significant.\"\n\nGrowing use of the technology has raised fears that it could block sun into reservoirs, affecting wildlife and ecosystems, or that electrical systems might not stand up to a watery environment - particularly in salty coastal waters.\n\nBut backers say that while environmental concerns need to be better studied, the relatively small amount of surface area covered by the panels - at least at the moment - doesn't appear to create significant problems.\n\n\"People worried what will happen to fish, to water quality,\" said India's Mishra. \"Now all that attention has gone.\"\n\nWhat may be more challenging is keeping panels working - and free of colonizing sea creatures - in corrosively salty coastal installations, which account for a relatively small percentage of total projects so far, noted Thomas Reindl of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore.\n\nHe said he expects the technology will draw more investment \"when durability and reliability has been proven in real world installations.\"\n\nCurrently floating solar arrays cost about 18 percent more than traditional solar photovoltaic arrays, Knight said - but that cost is often offset by other lower costs.\n\n\"In many places one has to pay for land, for resettlement of people or preparing and leveling land and building roads,\" he said. With floating solar, \"you avoid quite a bit of that.\"\n\nSolar panels used on water, which cools them, also can produce about 5 percent more electricity, he said.\n\nMishra said that while, in his view, India has sufficient land for traditional solar installations, much of it is in remote areas inhospitable to agriculture, including deserts.\n\nPutting solar panels on water, by comparison, cuts transmission costs by moving power generation closer to the people who need the energy, he said.\n\nHe said India already makes the solar panels it needs, and is now setting up manufacturing for the floats and anchors needed for floating solar systems.\n\nWhen that capacity is in place, \"then the cost will automatically come down,\" he predicted."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Trump Boots Jeff Sessions, Architect Of His Cherished Immigration Crackdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-immigration-family-separation-daca_us_5be34fb1e4b0769d24c899e0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:48", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump just ousted the Cabinet member who did the most to help him fulfill a campaign promise to harshly police undocumented immigrants.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions submitted his letter of resignation on Wednesday, the day after the election, at Trump\u2019s request. His departure was months in the making: The president has repeatedly voiced dissatisfaction with Sessions over his handling of the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nBut Sessions\u2019 legacy will live on in his actions on immigration, a signature issue for both the former senator and the president. Sessions used his time as attorney general to rail against undocumented immigrants and MS-13 gang members, implement punitive measures that led to the separation of families at the border, narrow guidelines for asylum, and elevate the prosecution of petty immigration violations to one of the Justice Department\u2019s top priorities.\n\nThe full extent of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigrants might not have happened without him.\n\n\u201cWe did our part to restore immigration enforcement,\u201d Sessions wrote in his resignation letter.\n\nWithin months of taking office in February 2017, Sessions instructed the U.S. attorneys in all 94 jurisdictions to prosecute immigration violations more aggressively. Though most unauthorized immigrants are detained and deported under civil law, jumping the border the first time is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison. Subsequent offenses can carry prison sentences of up to 20 years, depending upon the individual\u2019s criminal record, though in practice most serve far shorter sentences.\n\nThis year, Sessions went further, implementing a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that required the U.S. Border Patrol to refer every person they arrested for crossing illegally to the Department of Homeland Security for prosecution. The Trump administration\u2019s five-week-long experiment with systematic family separation was announced and made possible by Sessions, who took the unprecedented move of extending the zero tolerance prosecutions to mothers and fathers traveling with their children.\n\nAs of late October, 47 children that the Trump administration had separated from their parents remained apart from them and in government custody.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Jeff Sessions helped announce a \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to mass family separations at the border.\n\nSessions was also the face of Trump\u2019s controversial decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, even though DACA is run by the Department of Homeland Security. In September 2017, Trump sent out Sessions to announce the decision to put nearly 700,000 undocumented young people at risk of deportation.\n\nThe DACA decision was blocked in court, but Sessions has still done his best to move it forward. On Monday, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to take up a lawsuit on DACA in hopes it would allow the administration to terminate the program.\n\nSessions repeatedly tried to block federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement \u2015 an effort that could have deprived jurisdictions of money to fight crime based on their policies toward undocumented people. He was repeatedly foiled by the courts.\n\nA plan currently in the works to limit migrants\u2019 ability to request asylum at the border will likely be Sessions\u2019 final contribution to the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nSome of the attorney general\u2019s longest-lasting contributions may have been in the immigration courts, where as head of the Justice Department he could single-handedly reshape policy. In June, Sessions instructed those judges that \u201cgenerally\u201d immigrants seeking asylum based on gang or domestic violence do not qualify for it, potentially barring thousands of people fleeing danger from finding safety in the U.S.\n\nSessions\u2019 immigration moves weren\u2019t entirely opposed by critics. He pushed for hiring more immigration judges to address the courts\u2019 record backlogs, something that immigrant rights advocates and restrictionists alike largely support. But his department also put pressure on immigration judges to quickly complete cases through a quota system. The judges have accused Sessions of inappropriately influencing decisions, including in a complaint filed by the judges\u2019 union that alleges a case was transferred away from one judge because he didn\u2019t immediately order a man to be deported.\n\nAnd even as Sessions hired more judges, he pumped some 330,000 administratively closed deportation cases back into the system. The total immigration court backlog now exceeds 1 million cases \u2015 more than double the number when he started."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "The Democrats The Blue Wave Left Adrift", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-blue-wave-house-republicans_us_5be344dee4b0dbe871a63b48", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:48", "body_paragraphs": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Andrew Janz lost the race to represent California\u2019s 22nd Congressional District by more than 11 percentage points to one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most loyal allies on Tuesday, but that didn\u2019t stop his fans from drinking wine, eating churros and rocking out to the corny songs that are staples at these kinds of events.\n\nDemocrats knew Janz didn\u2019t have much of a chance of winning in the bright red central California district, but at least he \u201chad the balls to compete,\u201d said Stacey Woo, a 48-year-old supporter.\n\nDevin Nunes, the incumbent Janz lost to, was exactly the type of Republican that Democrats hoped to oust as part of the highly anticipated 2018 blue wave.\n\nHe shamelessly abused his power as head of the House Intelligence Committee to protect the president from a serious investigation by the panel into Russia\u2019s effort to help Trump win the 2016 election.

It\u2019s really disheartening.\u201d\n\nTo the south in San Diego, progressive Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar also aggressively recruited Republican voters, but lost to Hunter by more than 8 points.\n\nCampa-Najjar wasn\u2019t expecting the race to be called so quickly in favor of Hunter, who faces a possible prison sentence for using $250,000 of campaign funds for personal expenses. At a campaign event in October, he had told supporters he expected the results from the San Diego district to be among the last to trickle in. News outlets called the race just a few hours after polls closed.\n\nIn Sioux City, Iowa, fans of J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who challenged King, were stunned that the incumbent had won a ninth term. \u201cYou know, I think in the past, we didn\u2019t really have a candidate,\u201d said Jonny Wilder, a 24-year-old fast food worker who drove three hours to Scholten\u2019s election night party. \u201cIt was always about voting against Steve King. J.D. this time gave us someone to vote for. I don\u2019t know, I thought we were gonna win. I\u2019m kinda shocked, to be honest.\u201d\n\nBack in Fresno, Josephine Perez, a 58-year-old social worker who lives in Nunes\u2019 district, said she doesn\u2019t usually make it to the polls for midterms. But this year felt different. As a woman of color, she said worried about her sons being racially profiled and is horrified by how open Trump is about his prejudice toward anyone who isn\u2019t white.\n\nSick of watching Nunes fall in line behind the president, especially on hardline immigration issues, she made it a point to participate in this year\u2019s midterm and vote for Janz.\n\nHarren, Janz\u2019s communications coordinator, hopes that people like Perez don\u2019t give up after seeing another Democrat fail to oust Nunes. \u201cWe\u2019re all just hopeful that maybe the little wave we started here will turn into something bigger in 2020,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "70 Years Ago, Native American Women Couldn\u2019t Vote.

These women refused to be silenced despite coming from humble origins, and their fortitude and resilience make them so recognizable to me.\n\nBrian Snyder/Reuters Deb Haaland takes the stage Tuesday after becoming one of two Native American women to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nOf course, Native Americans practiced self-government long before the arrival of European settlers and subsequent colonization \u2015 and we enjoy recognition as sovereign nations to this day. But the fact that multiple Native American women succeeded at the polls is especially monumental considering our people weren\u2019t even given full legal protection of our voting rights until less than 60 years ago.\n\nThe 1924 Snyder Act entitled U.S.-born Native Americans to full citizenship and the right to vote, but the Constitution left it up to each individual state to decide just who was allowed to enter the voting booth. As a result, most Native Americans were disenfranchised until 1948, when the Arizona Supreme Court struck down a provision that stopped its Native American citizens from exercising their right. Other states eventually followed Arizona\u2019s lead, and in 1962, New Mexico was the last state to strike down unfair laws that prevented us from voting. On Tuesday, that state elected Haaland to Congress.\n\nFor some Native Americans, our voting rights remain challenged to this day. In North Dakota, ID requirements that demand voters provide identification with a \u201cprovable street address\u201d in order to cast a ballot meant many from the Lakota Nation and other tribes had to scramble in the eleventh hour to come up with proper ID before heading to the polls. This nation\u2019s sordid history and current controversies when it comes to Native American rights makes the election victories of Davids and Haaland all the sweeter. Add to their wins those of down-ballot candidates such as Peggy Flanagan (White Earth Nation Band of Ojibwe, elected lieutenant governor of Minnesota) and Debra Lekanoff (Alaska Native, elected to Washington state\u2019s House of Representatives), and we have even more cause for celebration.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Peggy Flanagan reacts after being elected lieutenant governor of Minnesota on Tuesday.\n\nWith these women in office, Americans can expect an indigenous version of leadership: reciprocity that begins with the art of listening. Haaland campaigned on a strong environmental message and has promised stronger regulations against corporations that pollute. It\u2019s easy to see why this is important to her, as New Mexico is a region at risk in terms of environmental contamination. Davids ran on school improvements and affordable health care, and as Kansas\u2019 first openly gay congresswoman, we can also expect her to fight for LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn our traditional belief systems, Native American leaders truly serve their community, pride themselves on sacrifice and aim to spend time with their constituents. In an era when many criticize politicians for \u201closing touch\u201d with the people they serve, voters can feel confident these women will remain connected to their hometown roots.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s wins have been years in the making, and they mark a significant turning point for Native Americans in this country. The victories of Haaland, Davids and others inspire hope that indigenous nations still have allies, the spirit to fight and an opportunity to create change."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Matt Whitaker, Trump's Acting Attorney General Pick, Is A Major Critic Of The Russia Probe", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-whitaker-attorney-general-russia_us_5be34b96e4b0e84388931ca2", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:49", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions and oversee special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation has sharply criticized the probe in the past.\n\nMatt Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor, is reportedly set to be sworn in as acting attorney general on Wednesday evening, just hours after the president announced Sessions had handed in his resignation. Whitaker has served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff since September 2017.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s unrelenting ire, Sessions was unable to rein in Mueller\u2019s expansive probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice, given Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the probe in March 2017.\n\nWith Sessions out of the picture, Trump has selected someone who has expressed significant skepticism about Mueller\u2019s investigation, signaling the president could be pushing for an imminent end to it.\n\nWhitaker, during an interview with CNN in July 2017, suggested that a potential future replacement for Sessions wouldn\u2019t need to fire Mueller to kneecap the investigation.\n\n\u201cI could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general does not fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\u201d Whitaker said at the time.\n\nIn August 2017, roughly a month before his appointment as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Whitaker penned an op-ed for CNN in which he suggested the Russia investigation was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and could be \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cIt is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then Mueller\u2019s investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family \u2015 and by extension, to the country.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also has ties to a witness on Mueller\u2019s grand jury, Sam Clovis.

Republicans in the House have been reluctant to investigate Trump\u2019s more controversial policies or to critically oversee the Russia probe. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has fiercely defended the president in the wake of the investigation.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nSessions was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s campaign and one of the first people nominated to his Cabinet. But the president grew publicly frustrated with Sessions\u2019 leadership of the Justice Department, specifically his March 2017 decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged coordination with the Trump campaign. Shortly afterward, in May 2017, Rosenstein decided to appoint Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation \u2015 a decision that also angered Trump.\n\nTrump And Sessions Spar\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration with Sessions became undeniable in late May of this year, when Trump tweeted that he wished he hadn\u2019t named Sessions as head of the Justice Department.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks came a day after The New York Times reported that he\u2019d asked Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia probe shortly after the attorney general announced it. Trump later pushed back, claiming that Sessions never told him he planned to recuse himself.\n\nThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn\u2019t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\nThe president aired his frustration with Sessions again a month later, when he criticized the attorney general\u2019s handling of a House investigation into possible bias against Trump within the Justice Department.\n\nTrump took his critique of Sessions a step further in August, when he told a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host that his attorney general \u201cnever took control\u201d of the Justice Department. Sessions fired back at Trump within hours, saying in a statement that he took control of the DOJ the day he was sworn in. He added that he has had \u201cunprecedented success at effectuating the President\u2019s agenda\u201d and said the DOJ wouldn\u2019t bow under political pressure.\n\n\u201cWhile I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nThe next day, Trump continued to attack Sessions, saying in a tweet that the attorney general should be going after Hillary Clinton.\n\nEx-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over \u201cclassified\u201d information.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 24, 2018\n\nSessions\u2019 departure comes at one of the most turbulent times in the modern history of the Justice Department. Trump fired both acting Attorney General Sally Yates and FBI Director James Comey last year, with the latter move sparking Rosenstein\u2019s decision to name a special counsel. Many key roles in the Justice Department remain unfilled. Trump has also repeatedly and publicly attacked Sessions, Rosenstein and the entire DOJ \u2015 attacks Sessions didn\u2019t little to thwart and which have taken a considerable toll on morale at the department.\n\nIn April, Sessions allegedly told the White House he would seriously consider resigning if Trump fired Rosenstein, people familiar with the exchange told The Washington Post.\n\nIn spite of attacks from the president, Sessions remained faithful in implementing many key aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda. During his stint as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, Sessions rolled back drug sentencing reforms, backed off federal investigations of local police departments, reversed an Obama-era policy that curtailed the Justice Department\u2019s use of private prisons and relaxed restrictions on the use of civil asset forfeiture. He prioritized combating illegal immigration and getting tougher on crime, two issues Trump frequently highlighted as a candidate.\n\nShawn Thew/Pool/Getty Images Attorney General Jeff Sessions (right) resigned from his position Wednesday at the request of President Donald Trump. Here, the two attend a panel discussion on opioid and drug abuse at the White House on March 29, 2017.\n\nBut the relationship between Trump and Sessions became strained as the Russia investigation dragged on. In early April, the president lashed out at his attorney general during a meeting with military leadership, calling Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the investigation \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d Trump also repeated his claim that he would have picked someone else to be attorney general if he had known Sessions would not lead the Russia inquiry.\n\nSessions had stepped away from the probe following revelations that he met with the Russian ambassador before the election.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this ... he certainly should have let us know if he was going to recuse himself, and we would have put a different attorney general in,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country,\u201d\n\nTrump made a similar comment in a July 2017 interview with The New York Times, where he also labeled Sessions\u2019 decision \u201cvery unfair to the president.\u201d Soon after, the president again attacked Sessions, this time asking why the \u201cbeleaguered\u201d attorney general wasn\u2019t investigating former Democratic presidential nominee Clinton.\n\nSo why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2017\n\nSessions responded on Fox News, saying that being called \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cbeleaguered\u201d was \u201ckind of hurtful.\u201d\n\nBut he indicated that he intended to stay in his job, and later became part of the investigation himself when he submitted to questioning by the special counsel\u2019s office in January. The president said he was \u201cnot at all concerned\u201d about the interview.\n\nTrump once again slammed Sessions in February for not investigating a \u201cpotentially massive ... abuse\u201d of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a claim his party had been making at the time to attack the Russia investigation. Sessions responded by pledging to continue doing his job with \u201cintegrity and honor.\u201d\n\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2018\n\nIn early August, the president explicitly called on Sessions to halt the Russia investigation, which he referred to as a \u201cRigged Witch Hunt\u201d in a tweet.\n\nTrump\u2019s numerous tweets about the probe have themselves become a part of the investigation, The New York Times reported. Mueller is determining whether social media posts might constitute obstruction of justice.\n\n..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.

He voted against the appointments of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example. He opposed Gina Haspel, Trump\u2019s controversial choice to lead the CIA. He also voted against both of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWhat Trump resented most, however, was the senator\u2019s role in derailing the nomination of former White House physician Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson withdrew his bid earlier this year over allegations that he oversaw a toxic work environment, overprescribed medication and drank while on the job.

What gives?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been finding it difficult to lose weight lately, there\u2019s probably an explanation \u2015 and, most importantly, a solution. There are a few key steps that you can take that can get you on the path to achieving your health goals.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of why you might be hitting a plateau as well as expert advice on how to troubleshoot any issues.\n\n1. You are losing weight \u2014 it\u2019s just happening slowly.\n\nAccording to Lisa D. Ellis, a nutrition therapist in White Plains, New York, there is a false notion that a successful diet will have someone dropping something like 10 pounds a month. For most people, that is an unrealistic standard.\n\n\u201cI point out to my clients that shedding just a half pound a week ends up as a total loss of 26 pounds a year,\u201d she said.\n\nEllis added that losing at a slower pace is also a safe way to ensure that your weight loss sticks. \u201cA half-pound a week is a rate that won\u2019t cause a person\u2019s body to sense the weight loss as famine,\u201d she said, noting that when a body senses a famine, it tries to regain the weight when the perceived famine is over, which is one reason why people regain weight at the end of a crash diet.\n\n2. You aren\u2019t drinking enough water.\n\nEugenio Marongiu via Getty Images\n\nMichael Jay Nusbaum, surgical director of the metabolic medicine and weight control center for Atlantic Health and chief of bariatric surgery at Morristown Medical Center, said that you cannot burn fat if your body is dehydrated.\n\n\u201cThe process of burning fat is very expensive water-wise. You need to be drinking more than 48 ounces of fluid per day,\u201d he said, adding that if you notice that your stool is hard or that you\u2019re constipated and unable to move your bowels easily, \u201cthen your body is telling you loud and clear that you are dehydrated.\u201d\n\n3. You are not sleeping enough.\n\nGet those Zzzs. Your brain and body will thank you for it.\n\n\u201cAny time we sleep for less than seven hours, our metabolism slows down,\u201d said Craig Primack, an obesity medicine physician in Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cOne study showed that the same person burned 400 fewer calories when they slept for five and a half hours vs. eight and a half hours.\u201d\n\n4. Your medication may be to blame.\n\nTowfiqu Photography via Getty Images\n\nPrimack said that certain medications \u2015 such as those for blood pressure, diabetes and depression \u2015 can not only slow down weight loss, but may also foster weight gain. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should ditch them: Talk to your doctor first.\n\n\u201cFor our patients looking to lose weight, we try to talk to their primary care physicians to see if there may be a good alternative to these medications. If there is not, we work to implement low-carbohydrate and low-calorie diets to override the weight implications of those medicines,\u201d he said.\n\n5. You eat healthy sometimes.\n\n\u201cA lot of the reason people have a hard time losing weight initially is they aren\u2019t completely committed to the process. They are always quasi-dieting,\u201d said Erin Wathen, a certified life and weight loss coach and author of the upcoming book Why Can\u2019t I Stick to My Diet? \u201cFor example, during the weekdays, they are good. On the weekends, not so much.\u201d\n\nIn order to make a serious dent in your weight loss plan, Wathen recommended trading in the concept of a short-lived diet for a healthy lifestyle change.\n\n\u201cFully commit to making lasting change \u2015 not until the reunion, the wedding or until you reach the magic number and then you can eat how you have always wanted,\u201d she said.\n\n6. Your workout may no longer be challenging your body.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWeight loss plateaus are also quite common and happen when someone has lost a certain amount of weight but the body levels out,\u201d said Justin Blum, CEO and owner of the Raw Fitness Franchise. \u201cIf this happens, switch up your routine to incorporate other types of activities you are not currently doing.\u201d\n\nIf all you\u2019ve been doing is hitting the elliptical, for instance, try adding strength training, sprints, high-intensity interval training or trying new fitness classes throughout the week to \u201cjumpstart your body again,\u201d Blum said.\n\n7. You\u2019re stressed.\n\nBlum said stress can play a major role in weight loss, especially chronic stress because it \u201cmakes your body believe it\u2019s using calories to deal with stress and makes you \u2018hungry\u2019 because your body thinks you need to replenish them when you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBlum added that cortisol and comfort food the biggest culprits when it comes to stress causing weight gain and preventing weight loss.\n\n\u201cStress management is just as important as following a diet plan, but the good news is exercise is one of the greatest ways to combat chronic stress,\u201d he said.\n\n8. You\u2019re prioritizing exercise over nutrition.\n\nd3sign via Getty Images\n\nYou can put in hours at the gym, but if you aren\u2019t eating well enough, then you may not be experiencing the weight loss that you desire.\n\n\u201cPeople often believe that if they just exercise more, they will lose weight. However, weight loss and healthy weight maintenance boils down to 75 to 80 percent nutrition and only 20 to 25 percent physical activity and exercise,\u201d said Molly Devine, a licensed dietitian/nutritionist and founder of Eat Your Keto. \u201cSo if your nutrition isn\u2019t on point, it doesn\u2019t matter how often or how hard you work out, the weight loss may not come.\u201d\n\n9. You\u2019re not keeping track of how much you are eating.\n\nA few chips, a fistful of nuts and several crackers can really make a difference if you\u2019re consuming them daily.\n\n\u201cOften, people grossly underestimate how much they really eat in a day. They may not count liquid calories or tasting food, or the mid-afternoon snack. Little things that really do add up,\u201d said Pam Sherman, a certified trainer and founder of The Perfect Balance. She suggested logging your meals into a tool like MyFitnessPal or Lose it! to keep track.\n\n10. You\u2019re not accounting for alcohol.\n\nThomas Barwick via Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a drinking problem for alcohol to be holding you back from your ultimate weight loss goals. It\u2019s pretty sneaky how it affects our metabolism and most diets don\u2019t usually instruct to cut out alcohol,\u201d said Karolina Rzadkowolska, founder of Euphoric Alcohol-Free, a space that empowers people to find freedom from alcohol for happier and healthier lives.\n\nAccording to Rzadkowolska, alcoholic drinks can pack on empty calories. \u201cOne glass of wine has between 150-200 calories. A beer clocks in between 100-200. And some heavy IPAs can be 300 calories,\u201d she said.\n\nRzadkowolska added that alcohol can also increase your appetite and lead to unplanned snacking. (Hello, drunk munchies!)\n\n11. It may be an underlying medical issue.\n\nIf you\u2019re making the right lifestyle choices and you\u2019re still having trouble, you might be experiencing an underlying issue, said Jill Brown, a health and nutrition coach and fitness trainer in Los Angeles. In her experience, this could mean that something is slowing down your metabolism or you could be experiencing a hormonal imbalance.\n\n\u201cA sluggish thyroid or low estrogen levels can cause this, for example. Quite simply, you need to be burning more calories than you\u2019re consuming and if your metabolism has slowed down, you may want to find out why,\u201d she said.\n\n12. You could have a nutritional deficiency.\n\nJaromir Chalabala / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI would say that one often overlooked cause of trouble losing weight is vitamin deficiencies,\u201d said Arielle Levitan, an internal medicine physician and co-founder Vous Vitamin LLC.\n\nStudies suggest, for instance, that vitamin D deficiency may be linked to obesity and that people with vitamin D deficiency have a harder time losing weight.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we find that repleting certain other key vitamin deficiencies such as iron, B12 and magnesium can allow people to feel better, more energetic and as a result, have an easier time living a healthy lifestyle which includes exercise, adequate sleep and thoughtful meal planning,\u201d Levitan said.\n\n13. You\u2019re not eating enough protein.\n\nStudies have shown people feel fuller longer and consume less calories over time when they eat more protein.\n\n\u201cYour body digests protein slower than any other macronutrient, which means your blood sugar and hunger don\u2019t spike, so you\u2019re less likely to overeat,\u201d said Greg Pignataro, a certified strength and conditioning specialist."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Duncan Hines Recalls 4 Types Of Cake Mix Amid Salmonella Outbreak Investigation", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/salmonella-outbreak-recall-cake-mix-duncan-hines_us_5be1d525e4b09d43e323803f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:53", "body_paragraphs": "Duncan Hines has issued a voluntary recall for four types of its cake mix as the investigation into a salmonella outbreak continues.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday that it was working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate a positive finding of salmonella discovered in a sample of the brand\u2019s Classic White cake mix.\n\nThe parent company for Duncan Hines, Conagra Brands, also voluntarily recalled the \u201cClassic Yellow,\u201d \u201cClassic Butter Golden\u201d and \u201cSignature Confetti\u201d cake mix varieties.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f RECALL ALERT \u26a0\ufe0f @US_FDA and @CDCgov are investigating 5 Salmonella cases that may be linked to Duncan Hines cake mix.

He recused himself from overseeing the Justice Department investigation in March 2017, after revelations that he had failed to report encounters with Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak of Russia during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Sessions said there was nothing nefarious about those meetings, although he acknowledged that he \u201cshould have slowed down\u201d and been more thoughtful in denying any contacts with Russian officials during his Senate confirmation process. His recusal was one of his first public acts as attorney general.\n\nMr. Trump has long believed that those who have supported and defended him are most entitled to high-ranking positions in the federal government. Mr. Sessions, in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind, had betrayed that axiom.\n\nIn a July 2017 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump unexpectedly lashed out at Mr. Sessions.\n\n\u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He said Mr. Sessions had given some \u201cbad answers\u201d during his confirmation hearings.\n\nMr. Trump never forgave Mr. Sessions, and over the next year and a half, his complaints about Mr. Sessions on Twitter and in his public comments became more pointed and insulting. At various points, he called Mr. Sessions \u201cbeleaguered,\u201d \u201cVERY weak\u201d and \u201cDISGRACEFUL.\u201d In private, he referred to him derisively as \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d after the befuddled cartoon character.\n\nMr. Trump also publicly badgered Mr. Sessions to open investigations into his defeated rival, Hillary Clinton, and other Democrats, and when Mr. Sessions did not, the president excoriated the attorney general. Critics from both parties said the president was shredding the traditional independence of the law enforcement agencies in seeking what appeared to be politically motivated prosecutions.\n\nFor the most part, Mr. Sessions made no public retort. But after the president chided him in February for leaving an inquiry into the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation to an inspector general rather than conducting his own review, Mr. Sessions pushed back. \u201cAs long as I am the attorney general,\u201d he said, \u201cI will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "How Sessions\u2019s Firing Could Affect the Russia Investigation", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/mueller-investigation-sessions-resigns.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:55", "body_paragraphs": "Of course, next year, when Democrats take over the House of Representatives, they could issue a subpoena for such a document, but if the Trump administration wants to fight that subpoena by asserting executive privilege, it is not clear what would happen.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Mr. Rosenstein the acting attorney general?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Mr. Rosenstein would become acting attorney general. A federal statute governing Justice Department succession says that the deputy attorney general takes over if the office of attorney general is vacant.\n\nHowever, there is another law, the Vacancies Reform Act, that applies generally across the executive branch. It gives a president other options to make temporary appointments without Senate confirmation.\n\nThere is some dispute among legal scholars about whether Mr. Trump can bypass the Justice Department-specific statute and use the vacancies act mechanism in a situation where he has fired the attorney general. But that appears to be what he has purported to do.\n\nUnder the vacancies law, a president can install a departed official\u2019s first assistant or install someone whom the Senate confirmed for a different position in the executive branch. The third option \u2014 which Mr. Trump is apparently relying on for Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment \u2014 is to put in place a sufficiently senior official from inside the department, even if he has not been confirmed by the Senate for that role.\n\n\u201cUnder that third category, that person is often a senior careerist, but the Vacancies Reform Act doesn\u2019t require them to be a careerist,\u201d said Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, a Stanford law professor who specializes in issues related to appointments. \u201cIt can be a politically appointed person, so long as he has served 90 days in the department and is being paid at a sufficiently high level.\u201d\n\nHow long can Mr. Whitaker serve as attorney general?\n\nAfter an administration\u2019s first year in office, an acting official appointed under the Vacancies Reform Act may serve up to 210 days. But if Mr. Trump were to nominate him to become attorney general, he could serve longer than that while his nomination is pending."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "How the House Fell: Republican Chaos and Democratic Focus", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/democrats-republicans-house.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:04:55", "body_paragraphs": "Even before Mr. Trump began thundering against an \u201cinvasion\u201d from Latin America \u2014 spurning with finality the moderate swing voters that Republicans desperately needed \u2014 his party\u2019s facade of election-year unity was crumbling.\n\nPanic mounting, Republican factions began looking out for themselves: Mr. McCarthy, currying favor with the right as he positioned himself to succeed Mr. Ryan, revived a push to fund Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. On the weekend before the election, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a far-right rival of Mr. McCarthy, began calling colleagues to gauge their interest in supporting him for minority leader in a Democratic-led House.\n\nAs Mr. Trump swallowed the already-faint Republican economic message with deafening appeals to right-wing nationalism, Republican campaign chiefs began expressing discomfort with his turn toward raw racial politics. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, head of the Republican Senate committee, expressed anxiety to allies that Mr. Trump\u2019s obsession with a migrant caravan could harm his Senate re-election in 2020.\n\nAmong White House aides, improvisation and favor-trading overrode any semblance of political strategy. Even Vice President Mike Pence, aides noted, appeared less than deliberate in his approach: When conservative media began rippling with interest in John James, a long-shot Senate candidate in Michigan, Mr. Pence phoned the president from the state and urged him to campaign there. The same day, a public poll found Mr. James losing by 17 points to Senator Debbie Stabenow.\n\nJohnny DeStefano, the White House personnel director, told an associate he used \u201cevery ounce of capital\u201d to keep Mr. Trump from visiting Michigan and other states where his party was sure to lose.\n\nAnd in a move that baffled their political peers, both Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy visited Kansas City on the Friday before the election to campaign with Mr. Yoder, among other Republicans \u2014 more than a month after the N.R.C.C. concluded Mr. Yoder could not win.\n\nLast weekend, the gulf between the two parties \u2014 in strategy and message, in political tenacity and internal cohesion \u2014 could not have been greater. Meeting with campaign donors in San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi declared confidently that the House majority would soon be in Democratic hands.

They had expected the exercise program to get people familiar with and interested in the idea of moving, he says. \u201cBut we did not expect the mindfulness training to have the effect that it had,\u201d he says."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Cancer Society Executive Resigns Amid Upset Over Corporate Partnerships", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/health/american-cancer-society-brawley-resigns.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:05:04", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration told Herbalife to take down a YouTube video that featured a former F.D.A. official implying that the agency approved weight loss shakes and other supplements.\n\nAnd in a 2016 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, Herbalife agreed to pay $200 million and was forced to restructure the business to settle charges that it deceived customers into thinking they could make substantial money selling the product.\n\nHerbalife did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThe company is too controversial historically,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine. \u201cIt has a very non-illustrious history with regulatory bodies, association with a product of controversial and most likely dubious merit, and is not where the cancer society wants or ought to be.\u201d\n\nThe Herbalife Facebook page shows both the cancer society and the company\u2019s logo, with the phrase, \u201cWorking Together to Make the World Healthier and Happier and Free from Breast Cancer.\u201d It does carry a disclaimer noting the cancer society does not endorse Herbalife products.\n\nDr. Caplan said the disclaimer isn\u2019t enough. \u201cSome people are going to think that there\u2019s an implicit endorsement,\u201d he said, \u201ceither because they don\u2019t look at the website or they just see the bottle and presume a partnership.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the cancer society\u2019s revenue was heavily reliant on walks, including Relay for Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, said Michael Reich, a spokesman for the organization. But during the past decade, he said, donations patterns have changed and walks, in particular, have become less popular.\n\n\u201cBecause A.C.S.\u2019s walks generated so much revenue and were such a large part of our portfolio, our declines were much more pronounced than some other organizations,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cWe have been re-engineering and diversifying our revenue portfolio, and partnerships are playing a key role.

About 12 percent of children in America now carry a diagnosis of A.D.H.D, and there was a 40-fold increase in childhood bipolar disorder diagnoses between 1994 and 2003. Five times as many children are now prescribed psychostimulant and antipsychotic medications as were in the 1980s. Today, a quarter of children and teenagers take prescription drugs regularly, and seven percent of older adolescents and young adults report abusing opioids \u2014 most of whom were initially prescribed them by a doctor.\n\nWith millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life?\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of factors that have gotten us here. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has taken an active, sometimes dubious, role in defining and promoting new diagnoses, through direct-to-consumer advertising and physician outreach efforts.\n\nOften overlooked, however, are how the psychologies of doctors and patients contribute. Clinical encounters that don\u2019t end with a definitive diagnosis \u2014 a clear acknowledgment of the enemy \u2014 are inherently unsatisfying. Doctors, through their training and mandate, are motivated to package a constellation of symptoms into something that can be understood, named and treated.\n\nAt the same time, we have both a growing arsenal of medications to fix patients\u2019 problems and a steadily shrinking number of minutes in which to do so. Not surprisingly, the path of least resistance becomes labeling and prescribing instead of exploring and managing.\n\nPatients are motivated by the understandable desire to name and ease their suffering \u2014 and today, many more patients have that opportunity. But it also means that much of normal human experience is treated with prescriptions instead of patience. This is perhaps not surprising. We increasingly have easy solutions at our fingertips: Dial-up modems have given way to broadband; stores are being replaced by Amazon drones; courtship is now Tinder. Is it wrong for patients to expect quick fixes from medicine?\n\nAn important step forward may be putting more emphasis on nonprescription remedies. For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don\u2019t come with side effects)."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Spanking Is Ineffective and Harmful to Children, Pediatricians\u2019 Group Says", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/health/spanking-harmful-study-pediatricians.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-07 17:05:04", "body_paragraphs": "Effective discipline involves practicing empathy and \u201cunderstanding how to treat your child in different stages in development to teach them how to cool down when things do get explosive,\u201d said Dr. Vincent J. Palusci, a child abuse pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone.\n\nThe academy\u2019s parenting website, HealthyChildren.org, offers tips for disciplining younger and older children. Rewarding positive behavior, using timeouts and establishing a clear relationship between behavior and consequences can all be effective strategies.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just take away spanking,\u201d Dr. Palusci said. \u201cWe have to give parents something to replace it with.\u201d\n\nThe number of parents who spank their children has been on the decline. A 2013 Harris Poll of 2,286 adults surveyed online found 67 percent of parents said they had spanked their children and 33 percent had not. In 1995, however, 80 percent of parents said they had spanked their children while 19 percent said they had not.\n\nAttitudes about spanking are also changing. Although seven in 10 adults in the United States agreed a \u201cgood, hard spanking is sometimes necessary to discipline a child,\u201d according to the 2014 General Social Survey, spanking has become less popular over time.\n\nIn 1970, Fitzhugh Dodson, a clinical psychologist and best-selling author of books on parenting, was quoted in The New York Times as saying that many discipline problems could be solved by using his \u201cpow wow approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pow, followed by his wow,\u201d he explained, demonstrating how he would swat a child\u2019s bottom.\n\n\u201cI know some books say parents shouldn\u2019t spank, but I think it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cA poor mother is left with nowhere to go. She\u2019s mad at the kid, has had it up to the eyebrows with him, and longs to give him a big smack on the behind, but she\u2019s been told she shouldn\u2019t. She should, and it\u2019s good for her, because it releases her tension. And the child definitely prefers it to long parental harangues.\u201d"}]
