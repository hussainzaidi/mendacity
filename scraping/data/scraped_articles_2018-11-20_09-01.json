He's said he knows more about ISIS than the generals do.\n\nThe President's latest spat with an admired military figure i s with retired Adm. William McRaven, the architect of the daring special forces raid into Pakistan that killed al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in 2011, acting on CIA intelligence.\n\nThis controversy, like the President's past run-ins with military heroes, was set off by Trump's perception that he was being unfairly attacked, apparently by a politically motivated critic.\n\nWhen asked on Fox News Sunday about McRaven's warnings that Trump's claim that the media is the enemy of the people endangered democracy, the President lashed out, accusing McRaven of being a Clinton backer and in the camp of former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Of course, we should have captured Osama bin Laden long before we did,\" Trump said, dumping on the military planners behind one of the most dangerous and audacious special forces operations in recent military history.\n\nHis response was characteristic for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it reflected his obsession with his predecessor and apparent belief that anyone who worked in a past administration -- even as a nonpartisan military officer -- is somehow suspect.\n\nSecond, it underlined how the President sees almost every issue through a prism of how it affects his image and prestige. Trump's first instinct when criticized is not to move on or shrug it off, even in deference to a great soldier's sacrifice, but to see the critique as a motivated by political animosity.\n\nThe episode is a reminder of how the President tramples protocols as a matter of course in his normal daily rituals. The idea that any other recent commander in chief would take a shot at a military hero like McRaven, who is respected across partisan lines in Washington, is unthinkable.\n\nThe clash also shows that when the President thinks he has been attacked -- by McRaven, a senior former intelligence chief, or a former prisoner of war like the late Sen. John McCain -- nothing is off limits.\n\n'Appalling and disgusting'\n\nFor someone like McRaven, who spent a long career serving presidents of both parties and stifling partisan impulses, Trump's tongue lashing must have come as a harsh blow -- even though he himself had criticized the President.\n\n\"The President shifted from the question, which was about freedom of the press, to insulting a retired four-star,\" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who is a CNN military analyst.\n\n\"It was just really appalling and disgusting that the President would describe him in that way,\" Hertling said on CNN.\n\nMcRaven made clear in a statement to CNN that he had not backed Clinton in 2016, though he said he did admire the leadership of Obama and former President George W. Bush, whom he also served in a senior role.\n\nWhile Trump's words may strike many people as inappropriate, he had learned early in the 2016 Republican primary that he does not pay a political price for such comments.\n\nMany political observers predicted that Trump's attack on McCain, who he said was not a war hero because the then-Navy pilot had been captured in Vietnam, would spell the end of his White House hopes. But instead Trump went from strength to strength.\n\nSimilarly, his insults thrown at the parents of slain Muslim US soldier Humayun Khan, who had criticized him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention two years ago, did not stall his White House run.\n\nIn a sign of how times have changed, the official GOP Twitter account, which in a past era might have been looked to for unquestioning support of a military hero, on Monday endorsed Trump's comments about McRaven.\n\nIn a tweet, the Republican Party said McRaven had been on Clinton's shortlist for vice president in 2016 and had been critical of the President.\n\n\"He's hardly a non-political figure,\" the tweet said.\n\nA more difficult question is whether the President's behavior is damaging his credibility as the commander in chief, who at any moment could be charged with sending troops to fight, and possibly die, in a national crisis.\n\nLeon Panetta, the CIA director and defense secretary under Obama, issued a strongly worded statement putting that issue in play on Monday.\n\n\"The President's statement criticizing McRaven for not getting Bin Laden sooner is patently ridiculous,\" Panetta said. \"It demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of how our military and intelligence agencies operate, and undermines the President's own standing as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nGiven that the military is required by tradition and constitutional role to fall in behind the nation's civilian leadership, there is unlikely to be any public condemnation of Trump's criticism from serving officers.\n\nFormer officers often seek to avoid being publicly drawn into the fray too, though they are more free to hint at feelings percolating inside the military.\n\nRetired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who lost his job as commander of US forces in Afghanistan after he and some of his colleagues were quoted mocking Vice President Joe Biden and other civilian officials in 2010, said on CNN's \"Newsroom\" on Monday that soldiers in the field need confidence in their commander in chief and what he stands for.\n\n\"We have certain things we want and demand of leaders,\" McChrystal said.\n\n\"And to a degree, there has to be a confidence in the leader's basic core values. We have to be able to believe in enough of what that leader represents to feel comfortable following them, sometimes to our deaths.\"\n\nAwkward moments\n\nThe controversy with McRaven, Trump's criticism of Khan's parents and his swipes at McCain are not the only awkward moments he has had as commander in chief. He was accused of not being sufficiently sympathetic in a 2017 telephone call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who had been killed in action in Niger.\n\nHis recent order of troops to the southern US border to deal with a migrant caravan that has yet to arrive has been blasted as a political stunt by critics. Earlier this month, Trump did not attend a ceremony honoring US troops killed in World War I outside Paris, citing the poor weather that had grounded his helicopter. He said in the Fox News interview that he should have gone to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day when he returned. He has also yet to visit troops in a war zone, as his predecessors often did around national holidays like Thanksgiving. But he did attend the transfer of the remains of a service member killed in Yemen early in his presidency.\n\nTrump frequently argues that no one has been more pro-military than he, and claims to have pulled the nation's armed forces out of a funding crisis.\n\nAnd in many ways, he has honored his promises to be pro-military.\n\nHe secured a massive $700 billion spending bill that will mean new fleets of ships, planes, submarines, missiles and helicopters and the largest pay increase for military personnel in eight years, though his claim that it is the first wage hike for the troops in a decade is false.\n\nTrump's affection for the military is emotional and political. He seems to see the troops as embodying qualities of power and masculinity he admires.\n\nIt's no coincidence that he has packed his administration with former generals. To hear him tell it, it often seemed as though he picked Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary because of his nickname, \"Mad Dog.\"\n\nTrump has often lauded hard-charging World War II Gen. George Patton as a hero. It may be no coincidence that the classic Hollywood biopic about the war hero opens with a rasping speech from star George C. Scott, who delivers an almost Trumpian monologue before a huge American flag.\n\n\"Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser,\" Scott says.\n\nTrump attended New York Military Academy as a young man, where he was taught, according to biographer Michael D'Antonio, that \"life is about survival\" and he showed on the sports field that he would do anything to win."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Clapper calls Trump's criticism of bin Laden raid 'complete ignorance'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/-788PQH7esA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Monday criticized President Donald Trump for chastising retired Adm.

William McRaven as a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" and backer of former President Barack Obama in a Sunday interview with Fox News.\n\nThe comments drew sharp criticism from former officials, rumbles of dissatisfaction from veterans and veiled expressions of concern that Trump -- or the highly charged political atmosphere under his administration -- may be nudging the strictly nonpartisan military into the arena of politics.\n\nEven as presidential defenders such as his counselor Kellyanne Conway argued that \"no president has shown greater respect for the military and the veterans,\" or funded it as generously, Trump's dig at McRaven underscored a more ambiguous track record on the armed services.\n\n'Unforced errors'\n\nThe President has insulted war heroes, prisoners of war, Gold Star families and, some critics say, tried to use the troops to score political points. He's directed 5% cuts at Veterans Affairs, which for some time he left in the control of non-veterans who happened to be members of his Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's neglected to visit combat zones, unlike other presidents, suggested troops' midterm election ballots not be counted, passed up Veterans Day ceremonies other leaders made time to attend and repeatedly said he knows more about military issues than generals do.\n\n\"These unnecessary unforced errors, when you attack people like Adm. McRaven and (the late Sen. John) McCain, it shows a lack of respect that's just baffling,\" said Melissa Bryant, chief policy officer at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and a veteran of the Iraq War.\n\nBut James Carafano, a vice president of foreign and defense policy at the Heritage Foundation, says any complaints about Trump's treatment of the military are just about partisanship.\n\n\"I don't think it's really an issue,\" said Carafano, who served in the military for 25 years. \"I think it's a partisan issue masquerading as a civil military issue.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump has yet to visit any US troops in combat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump has yet to visit any US troops in combat 03:34\n\nThe code and culture of the military bar active-duty officials from criticizing the commander in chief, and the emphasis on the importance of an apolitical service is underscored by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which states any officers who use \"contemptuous words\" about the President could face punishment.\n\nThat hasn't precluded serving officers from carefully making the distinction between military policy versus politics.\n\n\"We do have a very strong, nonpartisan, apolitical ethos in the US military,\" Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said at a conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sunday. He was responding to a question about the use of troops on the southern border to counter a group of Central American migrants headed to the US to seek asylum.\n\nThe deployment was widely seen as a campaign ploy, particularly after Trump stopped raising the issue as frequently after the midterms. \"We don't participate in politics, and we're very careful ... to stay in our lane and address the military dimension of the problem and not comment on policy,\" Dunford said.\n\nVeterans vote\n\nSome current and former military officials have made pointed remarks, though. Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of Central Command, Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of Special Operations Command, and McRaven have all praised the media -- a frequent Trump target -- and commented on the importance of a free press.\n\nSo far, veterans are sticking by the President and his party, at least at the ballot box.\n\nCNN's exit polls show that 60% of veterans backed Trump in 2016 and 63% supported Republicans in that year's ongressional races, while 36% backed Democrats. In 2018, the percentage of veterans backing Republicans fell to 58%, while 41% gave their votes to Democrats.\n\nEven so, Trump, on edge about contested Florida races in the midterm elections, tweeted to say that absentee ballots -- many of which are cast by troops, their dependents and contractors deployed overseas -- should not be counted.\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nBryant, at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, acknowledges Trump's successes on the military, including funding that Defense Secretary James Mattis described in March as \"the largest military budget in history\" and programs for veterans like a new GI Bill.\n\nBut she and other veterans said there's frustration that the President is quick to claim credit for successes and happy to bask in the reflection of the military's luster -- as when he floated the idea of a military parade in Washington -- but doesn't follow through on tough issues.\n\nThat includes addressing some of the long-term troubles inside the VA. Problems in implementing an expanded GI Bill have meant that thousands of veterans are facing eviction or don't have the money for gas, groceries or schooling because the VA is months late with payments. Thousands are suffering, said Bryant, listing the GI Bill disaster alongside a crisis in veteran suicide, housing, health care and support for female veterans as areas that need better leadership.\n\nBy the way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2018\n\n\"These are things he needs to address, and he's never there to address the hard problems,\" Bryant said of the President. \"He's there only when he wants to tout achievements, and frankly they're not his alone -- advocates and lawmakers have been working for years on these issues.\"\n\nOn top of that, she added, \"there's the disrespectful angle.\"\n\n\"There's not visiting troops overseas, not once,\" she said, referring to combat postings such as Afghanistan or Iraq. \"He skipped the Paris cemetery when other leaders of the world made it\" for a ceremony to honor World War I dead, Bryant noted. Trump later said Secret Service had decided he couldn't attend because of weather and traffic issues.\n\nJUST WATCHED Critics slam Trump for skipping veterans event Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Critics slam Trump for skipping veterans event 02:17\n\nTrump also skipped out of a Veterans Day wreath laying ceremony at Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the river from the White House, though VA Secretary Robert Wilkie was there. The President told Fox News on Sunday that he had made a mistake in skipping the event.\n\nAnd then, Bryant says, Trump \"seems to have a trend of going after war heroes -- McRaven, McCain -- people who are viewed in the military space and more broadly as thought leaders, all because they criticize him. That's what's troubling.\"\n\nThe President's habit of belittling military expertise and military heroes was on display during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he said McCain was \"not a war hero\" because he'd been captured during the Vietnam War. Trump received several draft deferments during the war, one for bone spurs in his heels. The then-candidate also mocked the Pakistani-American family of a US soldier who had died in the Iraq War. And he said he knew more than \"the generals\" about the terror group ISIS or about \"offense and defense than they will ever understand. Believe me.\"\n\n'I ignore it'\n\nOnce in the White House, Trump refused to issue a statement about McCain's death a few months ago or use the word \"hero,\" settling instead for a brief tweet. He has publicly contradicted Mattis in tweets -- announcing in August that military exercises with South Korea would not continue a day after Mattis had indicated they would.\n\nAnd in an October interview with \"60 Minutes,\" the President returned to his claims that he's more of an expert on military issues than Pentagon staff, saying he knows more about the NATO than Mattis, who he described as \"sort of a Democrat.\"\n\nRetired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal told CNN there's \"a certain honesty to what's happening now.\" He noted that \"The President didn't go to Arlington Cemetery for Veterans Day, and maybe that's honest, because if you really don't care, it would be dishonest to pretend that you do.\"\n\nCarafano of the Heritage Foundation says the public should treat Trump's words the way the President himself does.\n\n\"We've seen him say terrible things about something to one person and then turn around the next day and say wonderful things about that same person. That's just how he expresses himself,\" Carafano said.\n\n\"You cannot craft a policy listening to the President's comments and tweeting. When he says something about an individual in the military, he doesn't see it as saying something about the military in general.\" Carafano added. \"I ignore it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Brianna Keilar calls out Trump's habit of insulting the military", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/jlFk8s9UfrI/trump-military-relations-brianna-keilar-crn-sot-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "CNN's Brianna Keilar says President Trump has a habit of picking fights with and being insensitive to military members and their families."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'Make America Rake Again': Confusion in Finland over Trump's wildfire comments", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/zGw4sF5EaNs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said in an interview published Sunday that although President Donald Trump claimed the European leader told him Finns rarely have forest fires because they \"spend a lot of time raking,\" he doesn't recall discussing that with Trump when they met last weekend in Paris.\n\nNiinist\u00f6 told the Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, a CNN affiliate, that the subject of raking was never brought up in his conversations with Trump.

She claims to have subsequently unearthed a canvas in a forest in eastern Romania.\n\nBut Feticu said Sunday that she then received an email from two Belgian directors who admitted to tipping her off as part of a project called \"True Copy,\" according to reports. Images retweeted by Feticu appear to show her with what she at first believed to be the original Picasso canvas.\n\nA website apparently connected to the Belgian pair describes the project as a \"performance\" created \"with a view to bringing back Picasso's 'T\u00eate d'Arlequin.'\" It references infamous Dutch forger, Geert Jan Jansen, explaining that the project \"revolves around the life of a forger and the inherent question of the value of truth.\"\n\nThe site goes on to list a number of news stories reporting the alleged discovery.

He declined to provide any further details on any events tied to the upcoming G20 meeting.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared to throw the ball into Beijing's court, echoing a position taken by others in the administration as well\n\n\"On a trade deal, you never know,\" Conway said. \"That's up to China, as well.\"\n\nShe added that Trump would move ahead with his threat to impose another round of tariffs on an additional $267 billion in goods if no agreement can be reached.\n\n\"I don't know why people don't take him seriously because he obviously went ahead and put the tariffs on and thinks that we should not have a $500 billion trade deficit with China,\" Conway said.\n\nThe tariffs, which are paid by American importers, are designed to shift pricing power to US producers on a wide array of goods and components, but have drawn complaints from small businesses worried that higher prices will dampen demand. It's also spurred concerns about renewed inflation, just as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates in December.\n\nOptimism flared last week after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross floated the possibility that negotiators would meet in Washington ahead of the leaders meeting. The proposed gathering came shortly after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and China's Liu spoke by phone in hopes of moving toward a deal.\n\nTrump's comments were followed by a sour weekend during an Asian economic summit in the Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea, where Vice President Mike Pence stood in for Trump.\n\nThe No. 2 US administration official warned Beijing that Trump wasn't in a rush to end the trade war he started earlier this year and was willing to \"more than double\" the tariffs it has already placed on $250 billion in Chinese goods. The United States \"will not change course until China changes its ways,\" Pence said in his speech.\n\n\"History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, or a hot war, or a trade war, will produce no winners,\" Xi said in his speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Port Moresby.\n\nThe APEC summit ended on Sunday without agreement on a joint statement over a paragraph on trade, breaking a 25-year tradition since leaders began attending the yearly meeting.\n\nPeter O'Neill, the Pacific island nation's prime minister, blamed \"two big giants in the room.\"\n\nDuring negotiations on Saturday, four Chinese officials \"barged in\" to the office of the Papua New Guinea foreign minister in an attempt to influence the language in the draft final statement, a person with direct knowledge of the incident told CNN.\n\nA spokesperson for the foreign minister, Rimbick Pato, said the office had denied Chinese delegates part of the negotiating team a requested meeting at the convention center earlier in the day ahead of the drafting of the statement.\n\n\"The meeting request was declined as Minister Pato wanted to maintain his position of impartiality as Chair of the APEC Ministerial Meeting, only interventions by Ministers would be permitted at that stage of the negotiation,\" Pato said.

It sparked public outrage, prompted an investigation and led to calls for reform.\n\nBut the misplaced gun debacle was hardly an isolated incident, according to documents recently obtained by CNN.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration's Office of Inspection has documented more than 200 cases of air marshals allegedly misusing firearms or misbehaving with guns between roughly 2005 and 2017, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe cases ranged from seemingly mundane issues, such as improper storage of weapons, to situations in which air marshals allegedly jeopardized public safety.\n\nIn 19 of the cases, air marshals allegedly fired their weapons accidentally. For example, the documents state that in 2017 an agent based in Charlotte, North Carolina, \"unintentionally discharged a personally owned firearm resulting in a gunshot wound to his right foot.\"\n\nA 2013 case described an air marshal mistakenly firing his weapon inside a hotel room and damaging a television in an adjoining room.\n\nMore than 70 of the incidents relate to lost, misplaced or stolen weapons. At least three of those cases involved air marshals forgetting their firearms in airplane bathrooms. Two others involved weapons misplaced in airports.\n\nOn one occasion, an air marshal allegedly left his gun inside a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Totowa, New Jersey. In another, an investigation was launched after police found a \"range bag\" containing a gun box and ammunition in a school park.\n\nAt least 13 of the cases involved alcohol, including a 2012 case in which an armed air marshal allegedly flew on a plane while drunk and another in 2014 in which an agent was accused of being intoxicated during a firearms training session.\n\nThe TSA touts federal air marshals as elite officers who receive extensive firearms training that surpasses the standards within many other law enforcement agencies. In a statement to CNN, Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for the air marshals, said the cases involved less than 1% of its workforce.\n\n\"All reports of misconduct are taken seriously and fully investigated. When those investigations validate any misconduct, TSA takes swift disciplinary actions,\" said Kelly, who added, \"we are proud of the highly skilled and trained Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) who keep our skies safe every day.\"\n\nThe documents from TSA's Office of Inspection, which audits and inspects TSA operations, do not stipulate whether the allegations of misconduct were substantiated, or whether the air marshals involved were disciplined. The records also did not identify the employees by name.\n\nTSA has investigated 35 incidents in which air marshals were alleged to have unintentionally or inappropriately discharged or brandished weapons between 2007 and 2017. Of those, 27 incidents were substantiated and resulted in disciplinary action, while eight were cleared with no action taken.\n\nTSA did not share the number and outcome of investigations of other types of alleged misconduct involving firearms described in the documents.\n\nHow the cases compare to rates of misconduct with firearms within other law enforcement agencies is unclear because the total number of air marshals is classified. However, former air marshals say any mishap with a firearm is unacceptable because of the unique sensitivity of aviation security.\n\n\"When you're in an airport around thousands of people or in an airplane that's essentially a small tube 30,000 feet in the air, you have to be incredibly accurate. You can't make mistakes,\" said Henry Preston, a former air marshal and training instructor who retired in 2014.\n\nPreston and four other former air marshals reached by CNN said they observed inconsistencies in \"recurrent training\" during their time with the Federal Air Marshal Service, such as disagreements among instructors on how to enforce marksmanship and safety standards.\n\nAir marshals are required to undergo recurrent training that includes quarterly marksmanship evaluations and annual off-range safety courses, but a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found the air marshal service did not have complete and timely data on the extent to which its officers completed that training. Kelly, the air marshal spokesman, said TSA has implemented the GAO's recommendations on how to better evaluate air marshal training.\n\nThree of the cases in the documents obtained by CNN related to misconduct during firearms training.\n\nIn 2013, for example, an air marshal instructor \"committed egregious safety violations\" by allegedly throwing a handful of expired simulation ammunition into an open fire during a training exercise, according to the records. The ammunition exploded and flying debris hit one staff member in the face, the documents state.\n\nDaniel Kowal, a current supervisory air marshal and section chief at the agency's training facility near Atlantic City, New Jersey, said that while any case of misconduct is embarrassing, the Federal Air Marshal Service prides itself on rigorous firearms training and strives for zero errors.\n\n\"When we hear incidents like this, we immediately convene a panel to address them and we look at what was the underlying cause, what happened, if and when the training failed, how and why did it fail, and how do we plug that gap,\" Kowal said.\n\nIn addition to recurrent training, all air marshals must first go through a 16-week training course that starts with basic law enforcement techniques, taught in New Mexico, and ends with more advanced weapons-handling and other skills taught at the Atlantic City facility, where CNN observed training in action.\n\nKowal said air marshals must achieve a minimum marksmanship score of 255 out of 300, which he described as the highest firearms qualification standard in federal law enforcement, and he said air marshals have an average individual score of about 283.\n\nBrian Borek, who represents air marshals as agency president at the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, told CNN some field offices do an excellent job with recurrent training, while disparities exist at others because of limitations on size, resources and personnel. He said that doesn't make them less effective, \"just different and limited.\"\n\n\"These challenges are not unique to FAMS agency, however. This exists at all large-scale organizations. This in no way translates to the readiness or skill set of air marshals. They are the best in the world,\" Borek said.\n\nThe incidents of misconduct with firearms adds to a history of controversies that have plagued the Federal Air Marshal Service. Several former air marshals reached by CNN said that in addition to inconsistencies in recurrent training, grueling hours, low morale and even alcoholism affect the mission-readiness of many air marshals.\n\n\"There are systemic problems within the culture that affect the men and women doing the job,\" said Clay Biles, a former air marshal who wrote a book about the agency, titled \"Unsecure Skies.\"\n\nIn 2012, a commissioned study conducted by the Division of Sleep Medicine of Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School found that 75% of air marshals flying domestic missions were sleep-deficient. The study stated air marshals suffering from fatigue have increased risk of \"self-injury\" and \"greater incidence of serious errors.\"\n\nIn 2015, CNN reported that 10 federal air marshals had killed themselves since 2002, and representatives of the Air Marshal Association said job stress contributed to those deaths. At least two of the cases in the TSA Office of Inspection documents obtained by CNN involved alleged suicides by air marshals.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April that the TSA has had to monitor whether air marshals show up for their flights sober. The TSA said its Office of Inspection makes quality assurance visits to ensure mission readiness.\n\nSome government reports have indicated money spent on some air marshal programs would be more effective in funding other forms of aviation security. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that the air marshal service's \"contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable.\"\n\nA document obtained by CNN in August showed a TSA proposal to reduce the federal air marshal program that would save the agency nearly $39 million per year.\n\nJohn Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University who has assessed the efficiencies of various forms of aviation security, argues that the costs of air marshals outweigh their benefits. He recommends training and arming more pilots to resist hijackers and adding secondary cockpit barriers.\n\nReferring to air marshals, Mueller said, \"They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them. There are much less expensive security measures, which could replace them and save lots of money.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A police officer and two employees were killed in Chicago hospital shooting", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/axAkx1Yy2vU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Chicago (CNN) A police officer, a doctor and a pharmaceutical assistant were killed after a Monday afternoon shooting at Chicago's Mercy Hospital, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said.\n\nThe shooting was a domestic incident, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T.

As they started arguing, a friend of the woman attempted to intervene.\n\nThe gunman lifted his shirt and revealed a handgun, prompting the friend to flee. Two 911 calls in rapid succession reported an assault and then gunshots, Johnson said.\n\nWhen officers responded to the scene, the gunman opened fire on them before they could exit their vehicle. Officers followed him into the hospital and exchanged gunfire with him, Johnson said.\n\nDuring the shootout, Officer Jimenez was fatally wounded along with a hospital employee as she exited an elevator.\n\nThe officers \"saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he was prepared to do,\" Johnson said of the gunman.\n\n'I don't even have words'\n\nPolice secured the hospital and patients are safe, the hospital said.\n\nPolice say the shooting began in a parking lot.\n\nThe incident drew large numbers of law enforcement and emergency responders. Vehicles with flashing lights cordoned off the blocks around the busy medical center.\n\nWitness Steven White told CNN's Ryan Young that he was in the emergency room when he saw the shooter firing at police.\n\n\"We heard some shots so we all ran to the emergency window, we see this guy out there, military style, shooting at the police -- pow, pow, pow,\" he said.\n\nWhen White looked outside he said he saw a person lying on the ground by the main entrance. The shooter turned around and opened fire again before running inside the main entrance.\n\n\"I don't even have words to say how I was feeling,\" White said. \"It's sad, you can't even come to the hospital for treatment.\"\n\nAt least 15 medic units were sent to Mercy Hospital, Chicago Fire Department Public Information Officer Larry Merritt said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois thanked law enforcement members for their response.\n\n\"My heart is with Mercy Hospital in Chicago tonight. I am praying for the victims, their families, and those who were injured during the shooting this afternoon.

They had moved to Paradise seven months ago and were still unpacking.\n\n\"One thing we learned is having all our important documents and photos on hard drives. They happened to be all in one location,\" Clunies-Ross told CNN. \"That's what saved that stuff.\"\n\nSome of the family's clothes and their toiletries were already packed, left from a trip to Oregon the week before. Having some essentials ready gave Clunies-Ross the time to pack her medications.\n\nWhen she got to her closet, she started at her clothes. She didn't know what to take or how to pack them. She left them hanging there.\n\n\"I think in crisis you don't have the brain power to make any sense of anything.

I was just on the verge of losing it,\" she said.\n\nShe had sent her husband and two children on their way in the other car, as she was on call at the hospital, she said. She still hadn't received an alert to evacuate.\n\nThe 39-year-old made several trips to her car and noticed the fire was spreading quickly. A fire had appeared in her front lawn and the next time she looked, a man came out of nowhere and put it out for her.\n\nA few framed photos, her daughter's stuffed bunny and some of her husband's favorite vintage T-shirts also made it out.\n\nTheir home, made of cedar, didn't make it. \"It looks like a house was never there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad I have my family,\" she said. \"At the same time, nothing else really matters in the mix of it all.

Her friend from the Red Cross told her she should start getting ready to go. Nervous, her 20-year-old daughter pleaded for them to pack.\n\nShe gathered her passport and important documents and told her daughter they'd pack up a few things and assess the situation in the morning.\n\nIn the middle of the night, more alerts came -- the fire was coming at the 10-acre property from two directions, she said.\n\nStanwood Terranova's house was more than a home -- it was also her business and a retreat center she called a \"sacred place.\" She's a licensed spiritual counselor.\n\nShe sent her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend on their way and spent one hour going through the house and property. She opened the property's gates so firefighters could enter, packed items and she blessed each room of the house.\n\nStanwood Terranova stood in front of her library, asking herself what she couldn't live without. She took her two favorite books that she teaches from, each one filled with notes in the margins. Right above those, she reached for the many journals she's kept over the past 20 to 30 years, as well as the ones she wrote for her two children.\n\nShe took her computers, the start of the book she's been writing and all her business contacts.\n\nShe forgot to take any clothes with her, having to purchase some after she evacuated. She left a \"beautiful necklace sitting on the counter,\" but said she didn't care.\n\nHer two bull mastiffs, Brando and Juliet, were the first thing she loaded in the car and then came whatever else there was room for. Otherwise there wasn't much. \"I truly thought I was coming home,\" she said.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m., she evacuated for Ojai.\n\nShe later found out her home and business were destroyed by the fire.

Did Ivanka Trump turn over all of her emails for preservation as required by law? Was she sending classified information over a private system?\"\n\nThe White House had no comment on Ivanka Trump's email practices.\n\nTrump's usage of a private email account will bring comparisons to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose usage of a private email server instead of a government email account during her time in office was a central part of President Donald Trump's campaign against her in 2016. Trump's supporters often chanted -- and still do, on occasion -- \"Lock her up!\" at the mention of Clinton, and President Donald Trump has frequently accused Clinton of receiving special treatment because she was not charged for skirting the Presidential Records Act with her email practices.\n\nThe Post reported Ivanka Trump's attorney, Abbe Lowell, forwarded all the emails he believed were related to official government business to her government email account. Lowell believed that would rectify any violations of records law.\n\nPeter Mirijanian, the spokesperson for Lowell and ethics counsel for Ivanka Trump, said in a statement, \"Like most people, before entering into government service, Ms. Trump used a private email.

Democrats have won 232 seats heading into the 116th Congress; of the three uncalled races, they lead in one of them. Assume, then, that Democrats enter next January with 233 seats. Pelosi would need 218 -- a simple majority of the House -- to be elected speaker. If those 16 vote against her -- and no Republican votes for her, Pelosi has 217 votes -- one short of what she needs. One important caveat: Ben McAdams of Utah signed the letter but is currently trailing in his bid to come to Congress. So at the moment, that's 15 \"not Nancy\" votes, which is one fewer than the anti-Pelosi forces need to keep her from a majority. (CNN has a great tracker on who is against Pelosi and who is thinking about being against her.)\n\nWhat's fascinating about all of this is how truly unconcerned -- at least outwardly -- the would-be speaker seems. In a massive profile of Pelosi by Robert Draper that published on The New York Times website on Monday, Pelosi said this about those who have questioned her plan on how to lead the Democratic caucus next year:\n\n\"In terms of subpoena power, you have to handle it with care. Yes, on the left there is a Pound of Flesh Club, and they just want to do to them what they did to us.\" She shook her head emphatically. \"That's not who we are. Go get somebody else if that's who you want.\"\n\nThat last sentence is particularly striking: \"Go get somebody else if that's what you want.\"\n\nIt's also a nod to the fact that the anti-Pelosi crowd doesn't have a candidate to be, well, for. The only person considering the race is Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, although she has given no indication of where she is leaning. If Fudge says no, it's very hard to imagine any other Democrat challenging Pelosi.\n\nBut, her detractors would argue, that is beside the point. Because, unlike past failed insurrections against Pelosi, they aren't trying to beat her in the Democratic caucus vote -- where Pelosi will need only a simple majority of the 232 or 233 Democrats elected to the House. They are trying to beat her in the floor vote for speaker. And they're right that there is a difference there.\n\nIn 2010, following Democrats' loss of the House, North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler challenged Pelosi in the caucus vote. He got 43 votes; she got the other 150. In 2016, after Democrats failed to re-take the House majority, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan took on Pelosi. She won 134-63, a sign that there was a growing group willing to oppose Pelosi, but that that bloc wasn't nearly big enough to beat her.\n\nThis time around, the anti-Pelosi crowd is ceding the fact that they can't beat her in a caucus vote -- especially with no candidate. Instead, what they are trying to do is rob Pelosi of the simple majority she needs on the House floor, forcing her to either win over doubters on a second (or more) ballot or bow out. (A third option -- winning the speakership with the help of Republican votes, as President Donald Trump has suggested -- is a non-starter for Pelosi, who has said she will win with Democratic votes alone.)\n\nWe've seen something like this before -- except on the Republican side. After the 2014 election, conservatives opposed to John Boehner's speakership vowed they could keep him from a simple majority. All told, 25 Republicans voted against Boehner on the floor. That was less than the 29 defections he could afford. What's interesting about that vote is that six of the 25 Republicans voted \"present\" rather than vote for someone other than Boehner. Doing so lowered by six the number Boehner needed for a simple majority.\n\nWhich brings me back to Pelosi. It's not yet clear how many -- if any -- of her 16 detractors might consider voting \"present\" rather than voting for someone other than Pelosi. But if any did, it would reduce the number of votes Pelosi would need to win. Let's say, for example, six Democrats voted \"present.\" That would lower her \"win\" number to 215. Get it?

And he got the President to divulge new details about the written answers he has prepared for special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThroughout the nearly 30-minute interview, which aired on Sunday, Trump made a series of statements that require fact-checking or additional context. Here are five key examples.\n\nTrump says he didn't know Whitaker's anti-Mueller views\n\nTranscript:\n\nWALLACE: You have already made at least one big change, naming Matt Whitaker as your acting -- attorney general.\n\nTRUMP: Yes\n\nWALLACE: He has a long record of speaking out against the Special Counsel and his probe... Did you know, before you appointed him, that he had that record and was so critical of Robert Mueller?\n\nTRUMP: I did not know that. I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\n\nFact-check:\n\nWith this answer, Trump drew a line in the sand, stating unequivocally that he never knew about Whitaker's With this answer, Trump drew a line in the sand, stating unequivocally that he never knew about Whitaker's well-documented public criticism of Mueller and his ongoing investigation. This denial is difficult to take at face value. The entire reason Trump spent more than a year lashing out at Sessions was over his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. It's hard to imagine that, given how much vitriol he spewed at Sessions over his recusal, Trump wouldn't make sure his new attorney general shared his views on Mueller.\n\nOn top of that, CNN previously reported that people close to Whitaker advised him that he could draw Trump's attention by ramping up his television appearances. In 2017, Whitaker was a CNN legal contributor, and criticized Mueller on CNN programming, before he joined the Justice Department. It's unclear whether this press strategy worked -- but Trump is an avid consumer of CNN and cable news.\n\nAlso, Trump's response could come into play in the future if House Democrats, who are already scrutinizing Whitaker, subpoena Whitaker to testify under oath about his appointment to the top job.\n\nTrump whitewashed Whitaker's attacks against Mueller\n\nTranscript:\n\nWALLACE: And when you found that out?\n\nTRUMP: I don't think it had any effect. If you look at those statements -- those statements that can -- they really can be viewed really either way, but I don't think will have anything...\n\nFact-check:\n\nTrump claimed that Whitaker's past statements about Mueller \"can be viewed really either way.\" Which statements is the President reading? It's difficult to look at Whitaker's comments, either individually or in total, as anything other than strong and consistent opposition to the Mueller investigation.\n\nWith this misleading claim, Trump is painting Whitaker as an even-handed overseer for Mueller. This whitewashes Whitaker's comments, which were solidly in the anti-Mueller camp.\n\nHe shared an article that called on Trump not to cooperate with the \"Mueller lynch mob.\" And he dismissed the notorious Trump Tower meeting as an ordinary political move\u2014 despite the consensus that such a meeting with foreign citizens would be anything but routine.\n\nWhitaker has echoed Trump's oft-repeated talking points: there was no collusion and no obstruction. And in a CNN op-ed last year, Whitaker publicly urged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to block Mueller from investigating Trump's personal finances.\n\nTrump brought back the Peter Strzok conspiracy\n\nTranscript:\n\nTRUMP: From the day I announced. I was looked at as a candidate with nothing, no proof, with phony people like McCabe and Strzok and his lover -- you had Lisa Page, his lover. These people were looking at me, they wanted an insurance policy just in case I won or Hillary lost, and this was the insurance policy.\n\nFact-check:\n\nTrump resurrected one of his favorite attacks against what he calls the \"deep state,\" criticizing former FBI agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who was an FBI lawyer. The now-infamous duo was involved in an extramarital affair and were both involved in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and, to a lesser degree, the early stages of the Russia investigation.\n\nDuring their affair in 2016, Strzok and Page texted on government phones, and many of those messages have since been publicly released by House Republicans. One of those messages mentioned an \"insurance policy\" while alluding to the possibility Trump would become president.\n\nTrump and his allies claimed this is a smoking gun, proving that anti-Trump forces in the FBI hatched a plan to falsely launch the Russia investigation and undermine Trump if he ever won.\n\nThe Department of Justice's internal watchdog did an investigation and didn't find any evidence supporting the anti-Trump conspiracy. The 568-page report also provided Strzok's explanation of the \"insurance policy\" text: He was saying that the FBI should aggressively probe early hints of Trump-Russia collusion, even though Trump trailed in the polls and seemed unlikely to win.\n\nTrump claims he wrote his answers to Mueller\n\nTranscript:\n\nWALLACE: Your team is preparing written answers to questions about --\n\nTRUMP: No, no, no, not my team. I'm preparing written answers. My -- I -- I'm the one that does the answering.\n\nYes, are they writing them out?\n\nWALLACE: Yes.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. They're writing what I tell them to write.\n\nFact-check:\n\nCNN reported that Trump spent much of last week working with his lawyers on Mueller's questions. And in the Fox News interview, Trump claimed that he personally dictated the responses. There's no way to check this without seeing the answers, and they are still secret.\n\nBut we already have some insight into how Trump might answer Mueller's questions if given the chance, thanks to Bob Woodward's bombshell book \"Fear: Trump in the White House.\"\n\nIn the book, Woodward describes how Trump's then-lawyer John Dowd sat the President down for a practice-run, to answer questions he might get during an in-person interview with Mueller. Woodward reported that the sessions turned into a disaster, with Trump launching into a verbal assault against former FBI Director James Comey and repeating several falsehoods.\n\nTrump points to Article II as obstruction defense\n\nTranscript\n\nTRUMP: Well there was no obstruction of justice.\n\nWALLACE: I -- I'm -- let me -- if i might, sir, just ask\u2014\n\nTRUMP: I think they'd probably agree with me.\n\nWALLACE: If I may ask the question\u2014\n\nTRUMP: And all you have to do is look at Article II.\n\nFact-check:\n\nAsked by Wallace if the answers he's submitting to Mueller address obstruction of justice, Trump interjects to say there was no obstruction of justice, adding, \"All you have to do is look at Article II.\"\n\nTrump is referencing Article II of the US Constitution, and echoing a theory that his lawyers put forward earlier this year. CNN has reported that Trump's lawyers believe he didn't obstruct justice by firing FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 because he can fire anyone he wants thanks to his Article II powers. They detailed this legal argument in a letter to Mueller sent in January, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe letter represents the view of Trump's lawyers on this question, not the final, litigated answer. This is part of an underlying theory from Trump's legal team that he has extraordinary powers as the President, including that executive privilege prevents him from answering questions about the transition period. It's worth pointing out that these legal theories have not been fully-tested in the courts."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Experimental treatment helps 2 out of 3 peanut allergy sufferers, study finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/fsAbGBhY3gg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sometimes, Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\"I wanted to sit with my good, good friends, but I couldn't,\" the 10-year-old said. \"If you're a kid and you have a food allergy, it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\nThe study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.\n\nNot a cure\n\nDr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that \"it's not a cure.\"\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\nStill, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 554 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 496 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is \"treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,\" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nTwo-thirds of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nErica Gibson, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, and Ellis Glover.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\nDr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is \"the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.\"\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "More US children confirmed with paralyzing polio-like illness AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/H6cubZdU8pA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) More children have been diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis, the polio-like paralyzing illness, according to numbers released Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere have now been 106 confirmed cases of AFM in 29 states this year, according to the CDC, an increase of 16 since last week.\n\nThere are also 167 possible cases of the illness, an increase of five from the previous week.\n\nSince 2014, there have been 430 confirmed cases of the rare disease, and 90% have been children, according to the CDC.\n\nAFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and causes muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening, which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind, but it's also colder, which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.\n\nThe bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes, but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway, organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCrashes can, of course, occur at very high speeds, but injuries are typically not serious, usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line, when the bike \"exploded,\" Krause said, but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.\n\nAs Mario Andretti, one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions, put it: \"If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Deadly multistate salmonella outbreak related to raw turkey grows", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/jPNe2HyebRs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain.\n\nThe samples were from a Sept. 11, 2018 production, and, according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states.

Dr Patrick Connor, director of the hospital's emergency department, said she had been \"dedicated to caring for her community - a wonderful individual\".\n\nPolice said the gunman had been in a domestic relationship with Ms O'Neal and media reports say he was her ex-fiance, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nDr Connor also paid tribute to 25-year-old Dayna Less, saying she had joined the hospital in July as a first-year pharmacy resident and was a recent graduate of Purdue University.\n\nPolice officer Samuel Jimenez was a 28-year-old married father. \"We cannot thank him enough for his courage and bravery today,\" Dr Connor said.\n\nThe officer who was shot at but escaped injury during the incident shared images of a bullet embedded in the side of his gun, Chicago news broadcaster ABC7 reported.\n\nHow big a problem is gun violence in America?\n\nAt least two other deadly shootings were reported on Monday:\n\nIn Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the bodies of four people who had been shot dead \"execution style\" were discovered in a basement, US media report\n\nIn Denver, Colorado, one person was killed and three others wounded. Police are still looking for the gunman\n\nUS medical professionals recently became involved in an online campaign protesting against gun violence.\n\nThe hashtag #ThisIsOurLane was used by doctors in response to a tweet from America's powerful pro-gun group, the National Rifle Association (NRA), that suggested anti-gun doctors should \"stay in their lane\" after high-profile shootings.\n\nSome doctors rebuked the assertion, sharing emotional stories and photographs detailing their treatment of gun violence victims.\n\nAlmost 13,000 people have been killed by guns so far this year in the US, according to data compiled by tracking website Gun Violence Archive.\n\nThey say another 25,000 have been injured and more than 250 police officers have been shot while on duty.\n\nAre you in the area?

Was she sending classified information over a private system,\" he added.\n\nWhat did Trump say about Clinton's emails?\n\nDuring his presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump said that Mrs Clinton's use of a private server to send official emails while in her post as secretary of state in 2009 was a scandal \"bigger than Watergate\".\n\nHe repeatedly criticised her conduct, calling her actions \"illegal\" and a threat to the security of the US.\n\nAt the time of his campaign, Mr Trump frequently encouraged crowds at rallies to chant \"lock her up\" and vowed to imprison Mrs Clinton over the saga.\n\nHe also called on Russia to help locate some 30,000 emails that Mrs Clinton had not turned over to investigators after she, or her lawyers, determined it was unnecessary as they were personal messages.\n\nWhat was the Clinton email saga all about?\n\nBefore becoming secretary of state, Mrs Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office.\n\nShe did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government.\n\nShe said it was for convenience.\n\nMrs Clinton maintains that most of her emails from her personal account went to, or were forwarded to, people with government accounts, so they were automatically archived.\n\nAn FBI investigation concluded that Mrs Clinton should not face charges, but said she and her aides had been \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information.\n\nMrs Clinton has been cleared twice by the FBI over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n\nAre private emails illegal?\n\nIt is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business.\n\nHowever, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation.\n\nIf this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information.\n\nThere are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link":

It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.\n\nChris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.\n\nTransition\n\nThe transition period (which the UK government calls \"implementation period\") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.\n\nThe UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.\n\nBoth the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMoney\n\nThe draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or \"divorce bill\") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.\n\nWhile no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least \u00a339bn and it will be paid over a number of years.\n\nPart of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net \u00a310.8bn.\n\nIf the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the \"divorce bill\" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.\n\nMoney remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.\n\nCitizens' rights\n\nThis is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.\n\nUK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.\n\nCitizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.\n\nAnyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nBritish citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.\n\nNorthern Ireland/the backstop\n\nIf no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of \"a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom\" will be triggered.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.\n\nAs long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to \"level playing field conditions\", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.\n\nThe UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.\n\nThat upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nFishing\n\nThe agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.\n\nThe document says: \"The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.\n\nIt's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.\n\nLaws and disputes\n\nThe UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.\n\nA joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIf the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.\n\nInstead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.\n\nThat is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.\n\nWhat else is in it?\n\nElsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.\n\nThere's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.\n\nEU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like \"Welsh Lamb\" or \"Parma Ham\" remain.\n\nAlongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Rudd 'to listen to universal credit concerns'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46265558", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amber Rudd: \"I know there are problems with universal credit despite its good intentions...I know it can be better.\"\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has agreed to listen \"very carefully\" to concerns over universal credit, conceding the system \"can be better\".\n\nMaking her first Commons appearance since getting the job on Friday, she faced calls from Labour and the SNP to halt the rollout of the single benefit.\n\nShe said she would \"learn from errors\" and \"adjust\" the system, which she admitted had problems, where needed.\n\nShe also rejected a UN report on UK poverty as \"extraordinarily political\".\n\nAnd she made clear that universal credit had an important role to play in reducing the number of workless families and tackling in-work poverty.\n\nThe ex-home secretary replaced Esther McVey on Friday after she quit over Brexit.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she expected a change in tone from Ms Rudd and although not necessarily a major shift in policy.\n\nThe government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit - which replaces six working age benefits - by the end of 2023.\n\nBut the new system has been hit by delays and claims it is forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution.\n\nLabour has called for the next stage of the rollout - which will see 2.87 million people moved onto universal credit next summer - to be abandoned while the whole system is reconsidered.\n\n'Expert guidance'\n\nAnswering questions from MPs about her department's work, Ms Rudd was pressed by Tory Sir Desmond Swayne to ensure the changes were \"measured and continually improved\".\n\nShe replied: \"I share his view that it is vital as it is rolled out that we do learn from any errors, we do adjust it to make sure it properly serves the people it is intended to.\"\n\nMs Rudd said she would take heed of what campaigners have said about universal credit, following a call by 80 charities and other organisations for it to be halted.\n\nWhat is universal credit?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people.\n\nIt replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merge them into one payment:\n\nIt was designed to make claiming benefits simpler.\n\nA single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible.\n\nClaimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord).\n\nThe latest available figures show that there were 1.1 million universal credit claimants in August.\n\nThis makes up about half of all households claiming unemployment benefit, but only 10% of households claiming housing support and 2% of those claiming disability-related support.\n\n\"I am certainly going to be listening very carefully.

I'm the problem, but it's very difficult to ask people to make less noise because they always end up feeling like they can't be themselves around you.\"\n\nImage copyright Margot Noel\n\nAlthough she says she's had the condition all her life, she didn't realise it was misophonia until about three years ago.\n\n\"It was becoming clearer that I had a problem and I couldn't find what it was. Sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't have the right keywords on Google.\n\n\"One day I was really angry and I was crying, because I was watching an amazing play and I was just distracted the whole time by someone breathing like they were going to die, and I went back home, looked again, again, again and then I found it, and from that moment, to be honest, it was really great just understanding.\"\n\nMargot also discovered, via Google, that a study into misophonia was being conducted at Newcastle University and emailed the doctor in charge to thank him.\n\nHe wrote back, and soon invited Margot to take part.\n\nWhat is misophonia?\n\nAlso known as Selective Sound Sensitivity, misophonia is a strong emotional response to the presence or anticipation of a sound. There are three key emotional responses: anger, disgust and anxiety, with anger being the predominant emotion.\n\nThese intense emotions are accompanied by high levels of arousal - the fight or flight response. There is a release of adrenaline and a supply of energy to respond to the threat. This is typically experienced as a fast heart beat, rapid shallow breaths, tension, hotness, shakiness, and sweating.\n\nWork environments, such as open plan offices, can be a minefield of triggers. Tensions can develop within intimate relationships and couples can find it difficult to share normal activities together, as someone breathing or eating can become infuriating.\n\nSource: British Tinnitus Association\n\nThe trial was terrifying. She had to listen to some of her trigger sounds without reacting to them or even closing her eyes.\n\n\"I had wires all over my face, everywhere, and they were studying my reactions to the sounds and I just couldn't do all of it,\" she says.\n\n\"It wasn't that I gave up, because I told them I wanted to do it, but they said I had to stop because I was too distressed and it was confusing the results.\n\n\"I think I had to do six modules and I only did two, and after two I was just crying like I'd never cried before.\"\n\nImage copyright Margot Noel\n\nMargot found the trial so distressing because she could not use any of her usual coping mechanisms to escape the trigger sounds. In day-to-day life she wears ear plugs or headphones to block the noises out.\n\n\"I cannot live without music,\" she says. \"My headphones are on my ears all the time, even if there's no music in them - just ready to rescue me if something happens. Music for me feels very much like a protection.\"\n\nArtists such as Moby, David Bowie, Air, Diana Ross, Oasis and Daft Punk have become the soundtrack to her life, she says.\n\nMargot's anti-misophonia playlist:\n\nMoby - Inside\n\nMoby - One of these mornings\n\nMoby - Another woman\n\nAir - Talisman\n\nAir - La femme d'argent\n\nAir - Le soleil est pr\u00e8s de moi\n\nDavid Bowie - Ashes to ashes\n\nDavid Bowie - Starman\n\nDavid Bowie - Drive in Saturday\n\nTommy Tee - Aerosoul\n\nDaft Punk - Make Love\n\nDaft Punk - Emotion\n\nAphex Twin - Heliosphan\n\nRappin 4 Tay - Playaz Club\n\nDJ Mehdi - Signatune\n\nEven watching a film can be difficult.\n\n\"I hate, for example, the sound of people kissing. That disgusts me, I find it 'aargh!!'\" she says. \"One film out of two has people kissing passionately. Some films they don't make too much sound, but in others they do and I'll just have to cover my ears and wait for it to be finished.\"\n\nWhen it comes to her own relationships, however, misophonia has not caused any problems so far.\n\n\"I try to surround myself with people that are understanding,\" she says.\n\nI just try to deal with it on my own without asking people to change their behaviour Margot\n\n\"For me it would be a major downer if I was with a guy and I told him, 'Can you stop cracking your knuckles?' and he made fun of me. That would be an absolute no no for me. I'd be like, 'Well goodbye.'\n\n\"I think if people like you they just try to like all the little things about you, even the ones they don't really understand. If you really like someone you don't want them to feel uncomfortable, you want to make them happy.\"\n\nMargot is currently seeing someone and has a good social life, but says living with misophonia can be very isolating. She lives on her own, which she says is a \"dream,\" and works as a freelancer for advertising agencies.\n\n\"I'm quite solitary. I write a lot, alone, in my office, like a tortoise,\" she says.\n\nMargot often doesn't tell people she has misophonia as she finds they are not always sympathetic, and sometimes even think it's something she has invented.\n\n\"I just try to deal with it on my own without asking people to change their behaviour,\" says Margot.\n\nShe hopes the study she took part in will eventually lead to new treatments. But also looks forward to a day when more people know that the condition exists.\n\n\"If I could just ask someone next to me in the theatre, 'I'm sorry, can you just try to not do that noise, I have misophonia,' and they would be like, 'Oh I'm really sorry,'... That is what I'm hoping for more than a treatment - just being able to have that discussion with someone without them making me feel like I'm a freak.\"\n\nListen to Margot Noel speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Peanut allergy treatment 'in sight'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46259123", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:47", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Peanut allergy sufferer Emily says she can now eat birthday cake\n\nPeanut allergy can be beaten with a treatment that slowly builds up tolerance, a large study shows.\n\nNone of nearly 500 four- to 17-year-olds from the US and Europe could tolerate even a 10th of a peanut dose.\n\nBut after taking tiny daily doses for a year, two-thirds could tolerate at least two whole peanuts.\n\nEmily Pratt, six, told the BBC's Today programme it had made a big difference. \"I couldn't have a birthday cake at parties and now I can,\" she said.\n\nShe can now tolerate about seven peanuts, which means she can safely eat foods even if they may contain traces of peanut.\n\nFood labels\n\nEmily's mum, Sophie, from north London, said: \"It's been a constant stress.\n\n\"We were quite shocked how you could find traces of peanuts and nuts in all sorts of food, particularly foods that are childhood foods - cakes, biscuits, ice-creams - and that's what was stressful.\n\n\"We had to constantly study food labels to ensure peanuts were completely eliminated from Emily's diet.\n\n\"Her allergy was very severe, so even a small amount of peanut could lead to a very serious reaction.\n\n\"The impact on our family life was huge.\"\n\nAccidental exposure\n\nThe UK chief investigator for Palisade study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Prof George du Toit, a consultant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, said: \"The results of this ground-breaking study are very promising and suggest that we will be able to protect children who are allergic to peanuts from having a severe reaction after accidental exposure.\n\n\"This is extremely good news as the number of children being diagnosed with peanut allergy in the UK has more than doubled over the past two decades.\n\n\"Peanut allergy is extremely difficult to manage for children and their families, as they have to follow a strict peanut-free diet.\n\n\"Families live in fear of accidental exposure as allergic reactions can be very severe and can even lead to death.\"\n\nDuring the study, participants were randomly assigned into groups that either received capsules of peanut protein or a dummy powder.

In a straw-poll taken at the end of the most recent site-selection workshop, it came out the clear favourite. Nasa's administration has now endorsed the choice.\n\nThe 2020 rover is based on the one-tonne Curiosity robot that the agency landed in Gale Crater in 2012.\n\nInstrument-wise, the new vehicle is quite a bit different, however. Yes, it will again feature cameras, a robotic arm, a drill and a laser - but there is a new suite of sensors and analysis tools, and there is even an experiment to demonstrate how future astronauts might make oxygen on the Red Planet.\n\nThe new robot will use the same \"Skycrane\" technology that put Curiosity down with such great precision six years ago - but with an add-on. Engineers have developed an on-the-fly mapping system called Terrain-Relative Navigation which ought to bring even greater accuracy to the landing process.\n\nMissions to Mars can only launch inside a tight time window due to the alignment of the planets.\n\nThe 2020 venture will leave Earth in the July/August of that year and should land on 18 February 2021.\n\n\"Nasa has a long and successful track record at Mars. Since Mariner 4 flew by Mars in 1965, we've orbited, we've landed and we've roved across the surface of the Red Planet,\" said Lori Glaze, the acting director of Nasa's planetary science division. \"And we've got another opportunity to improve our track record a week from today when we land InSight on the surface. We're all looking forward to that.\"\n\nUnlike 2020 and Curiosity, Insight is a static lander. It will be the first mission dedicated to \"looking inside\" the planet. It will use seismometers to listen for \"Marsquakes\", to help build a picture of Mars' internal structure.\n\nEsa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 also. European scientists recently selected Oxia Planum as its destination.

It calculates that industrial emissions can be eradicated a cost of less than 1% of global GDP, with a marginal impact on living standards.\n\nThe ETC - a coalition of business, finance and civil society leaders from energy producers and users - supports the aim of the 2015 Paris climate deal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, or at the very least, well below 2C.\n\nIt sees benefits to society of cutting industrial emissions because this would save the costs associated with pollution and climate change impact.\n\nIt would also generate economic growth through technological innovation and increased productivity of resources.\n\nThe commission says this will require rapid improvements in energy efficiency across the whole economy.\n\nThis should be combined with vastly increased wind and solar electricity to power cars, vans, manufacturing, and a significant part of domestic cooking, heating and cooling.\n\nWhere are the biggest problems?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Steel is one of the industrial sectors targeted by the Energy Transitions Commission report\n\nThe focus of the report is on the tough nuts of climate change: cement, steel, chemicals, trucking and aviation.\n\nThese sectors account for close to a third of total global carbon dioxide emissions, but on current trends that is likely to increase just as the rest of the economy is cleaning up.\n\nThe report says it is technically possible to decarbonise all of them by the middle of the next century.\n\nIt recommends:\n\nMuch greater energy efficiency to boost progress in the 2020s, while more innovative technologies are still being developed\n\nDemand management to reduce demand for carbon-intensive products through smarter design and recycling\n\nCarbon capture and storage for the emissions that cannot be avoided from, say, the steel industry\n\nThe authors say we can decarbonise the difficult sectors at costs per tonne of carbon dioxide saved of $60 or less for steel, $120 or less in cement, and $270 or less in the case of plastics.\n\nIs there enough urgency?\n\nThe chair of the ETC, Adair Turner, said there was an \"incredible disconnect\" between the urgency of the climate problem and the \"glacial\" pace of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, where emissions are captured then pumped underground.\n\n\"Making the transition involves a step change in the way we do things,\" said the former CBI chief. \"It can be done and it won't break the bank ... but it will require real urgency from policy-makers, from business leaders and from investors and financiers.\"\n\nLord Turner admitted that having the climate change sceptic Donald Trump as US President was unhelpful.\n\nEnvironmentalists have applauded the ETC for laying out a possible pathway for emissions cuts, but are highly sceptical that the required level of urgency can be generated.\n\nThey note that the UK government, for instance, says it leads the world in climate policy, yet has just agreed a \u00a330bn road-building programme and a new runway for Heathrow, which will increase emissions.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Workers install photovoltaic panels at a farm in Zhangjiakou in China's Hebei province.\n\nKevin Anderson, a professor of economics at Manchester University, points out that the UK's proud record of carbon emission cuts does not count statistics on key polluting sectors.\n\n\"If we include CO2 from international aviation; shipping; imports and exports - then UK plc has made no real dent in CO2 since 1990, nor have the other climate-progressive EU nations.\n\n\"Until we dispense with our rose-tinted specs we'll not even recognise the problem - let alone the solutions. No nation is even approaching doing what 'they feasibly can' - and we will continue to fail whilst we worship the god of Mammon and ephemeral economics,\" he tweeted.\n\nJohn Sauven, head of Greenpeace UK, applauded the ETC's initiative - but warned that better thinking about solutions was urgently needed.\n\n\"To rise to the climate challenge, we'll need a much deeper rethink of the way we move around, build houses, power our economy, and grow our food,\" he said.\n\nRichard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said the report \"provides a key piece of evidence for governments who pledged at the Paris summit to keep global warming well below 2C, because it shows them what that entails for some crucial industries.\n\n\"However, the Commission is very clear that these transitions won't happen by themselves - it's going to need governments to step forwards with policies, and to do so quickly.\"\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter: @rharrabin"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "UK industry to make new 'Hotbirds'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46263970", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption The BBC World Service and World News Channel go out over the Hotbirds at 13E\n\nBritish industry is going to build two new spacecraft for the big Paris-based telecoms operator Eutelsat.\n\nAirbus will be the manufacturer, which will be supplying its new \"all electric\" Eurostar Neo model.\n\nDeveloped in a European Space Agency R&D programme, Neo promises a faster build with a 30% reduction in cost.\n\nEutelsat will use the two spacecraft to replace its flagship \"Hotbird\" TV distribution network positioned high above the equator at 13 degrees East.\n\nThe current trio of spacecraft in this location deliver over a 1,000 channels to 135 million homes across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East - including BBC services.\n\nThe contract, worth \"more than \u20ac200m\", is a welcome boost to the Airbus factories in Stevenage and Portsmouth in the south of England, and their supply chain.\n\nFlat market\n\nThese UK facilities have made a quarter of the world's big telecommunications satellites, but this is a market that is presently experiencing a period of stasis as major operators ponder their next purchases.\n\nThe rapid evolution of technologies and the rise of smaller satellites that can be linked together in mega constellations have resulted in a dip in demand for the traditional multi-tonne telecoms spacecraft.\n\nIn the past decade, there have been years when 20+ such satellites have been ordered. Monday's procurement represents two of only seven big platforms that have been openly competed globally in 2018.\n\nNicolas Chamussy, the director of space systems at Airbus, said he thought the market would bounce back eventually, and that Neo especially would prove popular as operators started to overhaul their ageing fleets.\n\n\"This new-generation platform is of extreme importance because it is the inception of a new product. It's top of the class with very high performance. This puts us - and especially British industry - ahead of the market,\" he told BBC News.\n\nTelecoms leader\n\nNeo uses ion thrusters to position itself in the right part of the sky. This type of propulsion system, which produces thrust by accelerating atoms of xenon through a nozzle, is highly efficient. Much less fuel is carried on a mission in comparison with the needs of established chemical thrusters.\n\nThe savings in weight and volume can either be used to pack in more payload and performance, or to produce a lighter platform that can ride a smaller, cheaper rocket to orbit.\n\nIn the case of the new Hotbirds, they will go to the launchpad in 2021 weighing 4.5 tonnes each. Without electric propulsion they would easily top six tonnes.\n\nAirbus says the new modular design of the satellites means their production timelines can also be trimmed, from 30 months to 24 months.\n\nThe development of the new spacecraft architecture was supported by Esa's Artes programme which aims to find the technologies to keep European manufacturers competitive on the world stage.\n\nImage copyright AIRBUS Image caption Sam Gyimah (C) is flanked by Rodolphe Belmer (R) and Nicolas Chamussy (L)\n\nThe UK is the member-state that makes the largest contribution to this agency programme, investing \u20ac500m over the period 2016-2021.\n\nSix of Eutelsat's next seven spacecraft are bing built in Britain, which includes another Esa-Artes-inspired project called Quantum.

The shape helps it stop rolling away.\n\nDespite having round anuses like other mammals, wombats do not produce round pellets, tubular coils or messy piles.\n\nResearchers revealed on Sunday the varied elasticity of the intestines help to sculpt the poop into cubes.\n\n\"The first thing that drove me to this is that I have never seen anything this weird in biology. That was a mystery,\" Georgia Institute of Technology's Patricia Yang said.\n\nAfter studying the digestive tracts of wombats put down after road accidents in Tasmania, a team led by Dr Yang presented its findings at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics' annual meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\"We opened those intestines up like it was Christmas,\" said co-author David Hu, also from Georgia Tech, according to Science News.\n\nThe team compared the wombat intestines to pig intestines by inserting a balloon into the animals' digestive tracts to see how it stretched to fit the balloon.\n\nIn wombats, the faeces changed from a liquid-like state into a solid state in the last 25% of the intestines - but then in the final 8% a varied elasticity of the walls meant the poop would take shape as separated cubes.\n\nThis, the scientists explain, resulted in 2cm (0.8in) cube-shaped poops unique to wombats and the natural world.\n\nThe marsupial then stacks the cubes - the higher the better so as to communicate with and attract other wombats.\n\n\"We currently have only two methods to manufacture cubes: We mould it, or we cut it. Now we have this third method,\" Dr Yang said.\n\n\"It would be a cool method to apply to the manufacturing process,\" she suggested, \"how to make a cube with soft tissue instead of just moulding it.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Kilogram gets a new definition", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46143399", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright SPL Image caption There are now discrepancies between copies of the kilogram and the master version held in a French vault\n\nScientists have changed the way the kilogram is defined.\n\nCurrently, it is defined by the weight of a platinum-based ingot called \"Le Grand K\" which is locked away in a safe in Paris.\n\nOn Friday, researchers meeting in Versailles voted to get rid of it in favour of defining a kilogram in terms of an electric current.\n\nThe decision was made at the General Conference on Weights and Measures.\n\nBut some scientists, such as Perdi Williams at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, have expressed mixed feelings about the change.\n\n\"I haven't been on this project for too long but I feel a weird attachment to the kilogram,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it is such an exciting thing and this is a really big moment. So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Percentage Of Unvaccinated Children In U.S. Has Quadrupled Since 2001", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/percentage-of-unvaccinated-children-in-u-s-has-quadrup-1830548516", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1.3 percent of children born in 2017 did not receive any recommended vaccinations compared to 0.3 percent in 2001.

who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years - as a potential successor to King Salman, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nAmid international outrage over Khashoggi's murder, dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession, but will not act while King Salman - the crown prince's 82-year-old father - is still alive, sources said.\n\nThey recognise the king is unlikely to turn against his favourite son, the report added.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king's death, Prince Ahmed, 76, uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nMonday, November 19\n\nFrance to decide soon on sanctions\n\nFrance will decide very soon to impose sanctions on individuals linked to Khashoggi's murder, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said.\n\n\"We are working very closely with Germany at this moment ... and we will decide ourselves a certain number of sanctions very quickly over what we know (about the murder),\" Le Drian told Europe 1 radio on Monday when asked whether Paris would follow Berlin in imposing travel bans on Saudi individuals.\n\n\"But we believe that we need to go beyond that because the whole truth needs to be known,\" he added.\n\nTurkey discusses Khashoggi murder with UN chief\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has held talks with Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, over Khashoggi's killing.\n\n\"They discussed Yemen, Syria, Cyprus, as well as the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters.\n\nOn a possible UN inquiry into Khashoggi, he added: \"We have not received any formal request from the Turkish side.\"\n\nAs Cavusoglu left the UN after meeting Guterres, he was asked if he requested an international investigation. \"We discussed all the aspects of this,\" he said.\n\nFour prominent rights groups -

Trump also said he wonders: \"Will anybody really know?\"\n\nThe United States President, Donald Trump, has said that his administration will release a full report in the next two days about the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nTrump told reporters on Saturday that the report will include information on \"who did it\".\n\n\"We'll be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday,\" he said.\n\nSaturday, November 17\n\nUS has made no 'final conclusion' on Khashoggi killing: State Department\n\nThe United States government has not reached a final conclusion over Khashoggi's killing, the US State Department has said.\n\n\n\n\"Recent reports indicating that the US government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate,\" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe statement followed reports in the US media that the CIA had held Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for the October 2 killing.\n\n\"There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr Khashoggi,\" Nauert said in her statement.\n\n\"The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts.

However, for East Jerusalem Palestinians, turning to Israeli police or social workers is an absolute last resort.\n\nJuzoor's spokesperson Majd Hardan said talking to Israeli service providers is being considered by the Palestinian community as betrayal, or as abandoning family structures.\n\n\"Family, in-laws, neighbours and friends believe the woman is asking the enemy for help,\" Hardan told Al Jazeera. \"She should take the pain and be silent,\" she said, explaining the mentality in East Jerusalem.\n\nLiving in Jerusalem's Old City, Nisreen never thought of going to the Israeli police.\n\n\"An Israeli social affairs officer came to the hospital when I was there. I said I had fallen on the ground,\" she explained, adding she couldn't say what her husband had done.\n\n\"I won't talk to them because of the stigma and for fear of losing custody of my sons.\"\n\nOccupation increases violence\n\nHardan from Juzoor also stressed that the continual presence of Israeli soldiers and settlers in East Jerusalem has an effect on gender-based violence in the city.\n\n\"A lot of families don't accept women to leave the house, they're afraid if they take the bus or transportation someone will hit on them or violate their freedom,\" Hardan said.\n\n\"This is a form of domestic violence; you can't keep them prisoner in the house\u2026 just because you don't want them to go out and see soldiers and settlers.\"\n\nNisreen has stayed married for 32 years and, even after having three sons, the abuse never ceased. She said that as they grew up, they started to abuse her as well, adopting their father's traits.\n\n\"They forbid me to leave the house. I have to lie to get out; I say that I'm going to the doctor or have a meeting somewhere,\" Nisreen explained.\n\n\"I'm constantly scared because they threaten me by [for example] throwing a chair right next to me, which makes my heart race.\"\n\nFamily denial\n\nThe issue of domestic violence transcends the boundaries of East Jerusalem and, just as Nisreen found no support from her brother when she was abused, women in other areas of the occupied West Bank face similar concerns.\n\nThe village of Fasa'il, 14km north of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, has the highest recorded rate of sexual harassment in the West Bank, according to the Palestine Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA).\n\nFarida, a 40-year-old mother of six, was married at the young age of 17. She requested her name to be changed for safety concerns.\n\n\"I didn't know anything about married life,\" Farida told Al Jazeera while sitting out of sight of her children. \"My family said my new father-in-law would be like a father to me, and my mother-in-law like a new mother.\"\n\nFarida still lives in Fasa'il, though in the home behind her husband and his second wife. She recalled the time three days after her marriage when her father-in-law sexually abused her.\n\n\"He would touch me in inappropriate places, so I told my aunt and my husband's brother about the situation. They said maybe it was by accident, that he didn't mean to touch me.\"\n\nAfter delivering her first child two years later, she received guests in the family home for a celebration. After everyone had left, her father-in-law repeated the abuse.\n\n\"He grabbed me from my hand and led me to the kitchen. He wanted to rape me, he was touching me in inappropriate places. I was lucky I could run,\" Farida said, breathing heavily to hold back tears as she spoke.\n\n\"I cannot forget what happened that day, and I can't remember why I didn't scream.\"\n\nWhen Farida told the rest of the family about the incident, she was called a liar, a title she has borne to this day. \"You can't argue with this kind of community, they won't confess they did anything wrong.\"\n\nInstead, her husband's family threatened to take her son from her and stopped providing her with money she needed to live comfortably.\n\nEntrenched patriarchal norms\n\nYWCA Jericho coordinator Aman Hammad points to entrenched patriarchal family structures in the Palestinian territories as a major factor in the levels of domestic abuse.\n\nParticularly in Fasa'il, girls are not allowed to leave the village for work or educational opportunities from a young age, subsequently leaving them powerless and financially dependent.\n\n\"If they move around a lot, it means she's a bad girl and she won't have an opportunity to be married afterwards,\" Hammad told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The community starts to think they've experienced things or are prone to many factors that could harm her or affect her reputation.\"\n\nJericho Governorate Gender Unit Manager Samah Salman mentioned that girls are raised to serve men.\n\n\"It reinforces the stereotype of men being better, in all aspects of life.

He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family's senior members, who opposed MBS becoming crown prince in 2017, Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nTribal tradition\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom's tribal traditions dictate the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSaudi sources said they were confident Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by the crown prince, would honour existing military procurement contracts, and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nHowever, one senior US official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from MBS despite pressure from legislators and the CIA's assessment he ordered Khashoggi's murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son - also known as MBS - in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi's killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nThe Saudi sources said US officials had cooled on MBS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also unhappy because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defence ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested the defence ministry \"focus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\" and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defence ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n'A red line'\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday claims, including by the CIA, that MBS gave the order to kill Khashoggi were false, according to an Arabic-language newspaper interview.\n\n\"We in the kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in truth and we categorically reject them, whether through leaks or not,\" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir was quoted as saying in Saudi-owned al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper.\n\n\"They are leaks that have not been officially announced, and I have noticed that they are based on an assessment, not conclusive evidence.\"\n\nJubeir was also asked about comments by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the kill order came from the highest level of the Saudi leadership but probably not King Salman, which has put the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince.\n\n\"We have already asked the Turkish authorities at the highest level about the meaning of these comments, and they confirmed to us categorically that the crown prince is not meant by these comments,\" he said.\n\n\"The leadership of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia - represented by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the king] and the crown prince - is a red line and we will not permit attempts to harm or undermine them.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia's public prosecutor has also said the crown prince knew nothing of Khashoggi's killing.\n\nConsolidated control\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nSince his ascension, MBS has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms, including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHowever, the reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalised senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi's security and intelligence agencies. The entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \"would not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\" because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\"They [the security apparatus] will follow any consensus reached by the family.\"\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "China's Xi arrives in Manila with focus on infrastructure pledges", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/china-xi-arrives-manila-focus-infrastructure-pledges-181120062332137.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Xi Jinping arrived in the Philippines on Tuesday for the first state visit by a Chinese president in 13 years, with the administration of Rodrigo Duterte under pressure to show there is value in its \"pivot\" to China.\n\nThe state visit comes two years after Duterte declared he would pursue a more independent foreign policy, shifting the Philippines away from the United States and towards China in the hope of receiving billions of dollars for infrastructure development.\n\n\"The government needs to show that its concessions, its pivot to China, are actually worth it,\" said Jamela Alindogan, Al Jazeera's Manila correspondent. \"It needs to show to the general public that its choice to move away from its long-standing ally, the United States, is beneficial.\"\n\nChina has pledged about $24bn in loans and investments, although just three of dozens of planned projects have broken ground.\n\nXi and Duterte are expected to release a joint statement at the end of the two-day visit.\n\n'A rainbow'\n\nIn a commentary published in Monday's Philippine Star newspaper, Xi praised Duterte and described ties as being \"a rainbow after the rain\" and repeatedly called for the \"proper handling\" of rows over the South China Sea.\n\nChina has become increasingly assertive over the sea, which it claims in its entirety.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Washington Post: US Preparing to Add Venezuela to Terrorism Sponsors List", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-venezuela-relations/4665957.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration is preparing to add Venezuela to a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that would escalate Washington's diplomatic struggle with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, The Washington Post said on Monday.\n\nThe Post said the U.S. State Department had been asking for feedback on the proposed move from various agencies in recent days, but it said U.S. officials declined to say whether a final decision had been made about the designation."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Briefly Closes Major Border Crossing with Mexico", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-briefly-closes-major-border-crossing-with-mexico/4665877.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. officials briefly shut down one of the world's busiest border crossings Monday to set up concrete blocks and barbed wire as Central American migrants arrive.\n\nThe closure of the crossing between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, California, kept a large number of Mexicans from entering the U.S. where there are jobs.\n\nIt also caused a massive traffic backup for U.S. citizens trying to get back home after visiting Mexico.\n\nThe barriers are an apparent precaution against fears that a large number of people may try to rush the border to get into the U.S.\n\nAbout 3,000 migrants from the various Central American caravans are already in Tijuana and thousands more are expected throughout the week.\n\nThey have gotten a hostile reception from hundreds of locals in Tijuana, who greeted the migrants with cries of \"get out\" and \"go home.\"\n\nSome echoed President Donald Trump's rhetoric, calling the Central Americans criminals and the caravan an \"invasion.\"\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday that the U.S. is \"ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it.

Mora lays out a future scenario in which in 2100 New York will be constantly dealing with the potentially devastating effects of four different climate hazards, including extreme weather and sea level rise.\n\nAll of these effects are measurable and in the future a city like Miami might be dealing with drought, extreme heat, sea level rise and more numerous and more powerful hurricanes. \"Any coastal area in the tropics is going to be on fire\" Mora says. Sydney, Los Angeles, Brazil and Mexico City are all at risk as the effects of climate change stack up.\"\n\nMora's study is impressive in its detail, noting, \"Planes can\u2019t fly during heat waves ... wires short circuit during heat waves,\" Mora says. And for people who work outdoors it can literally get too hot and \"their livelihoods depend on their job ability to work out doors.\"\n\nAll of these impacts add up and have a profound economic effect. Mora says they create stressed communities that have less economic ability to deal with change, plus higher financial costs thanks to the infrastructure damage and repair associated with predicted extreme weather events.\n\nIs it too late?\n\nBut despite all of the bad news in this assessment, Mora is bullish on our ability to head off the effects of climate change.\n\n\"This is not game over,\" he says. \"We are not too late to turn this around and we have pathways to reduce emissions what we need to do is implement them.\"\n\nMora says the solution to the world's carbon problem will not come from the world's leaders, despite agreements like the Paris Accord for which hundreds of the world's leaders came together to commit to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHe says the real change to mitigate climate change through gradual cutting of emissions will come from the public, and he points to efforts like Hawaii's decision to become a carbon neutral state by 2045 and to shift to 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nMora is also involved with tree planting efforts in Hawaii that he says if done worldwide could help the planet actually remove carbon from the atmosphere, not just stop putting it in.

They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some members of the Saudi royal family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king\u2019s death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nPrince Ahmed, King Salman\u2019s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.\n\nPrince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family\u2019s senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom\u2019s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA\u2019s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cvery premature\u201d but \u201cpossible,\u201d and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \u201cnothing else to add at this time\u201d.\n\nThe Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry \u201cfocus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\u201d and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. ROLE KEY\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi\u2019s security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \u201cwould not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\u201d because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\u201cThey (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \u201croll some heads to appease the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role \u2013 including one of MbS\u2019s closest aides.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi King Salman expressed support for his son, the crown prince, who is accused or orchestrating the slaying.\n\nALLEGIANCE COUNCIL\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman\u2019s wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi\u2019s killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Protesters Opposing Migrant Caravan Clash With Police In Tijuana", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protesters-migrant-caravan-tijuana_us_5bf28209e4b075738820085b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Residents of the Mexican border city of Tijuana protested the arrival of thousands of Central American migrants, who are hoping to seek shelter while they await an opportunity to enter the United States.\n\nMexican police in riot gear faced off against the group of protesters, estimated in the hundreds, outside of a sports complex that was turned into a makeshift migrant shelter on Sunday.

The request was made by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which quickly sued after President Donald Trump issued the ban this month in response to the caravans of migrants that have started to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border would be ineligible for asylum.

As a result, Americans shoulder the highest drug prices in the world while receiving significantly poorer public health outcomes than most of the developed world.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to address that problem, but a new proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) would attack prescription drug price-gouging at the source: the government-granted monopoly that gives Big Pharma unchecked pricing power.\n\n\u201cNo other country allows pharmaceutical companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cSomebody in America today can walk into a pharmacy and find out that the medicine they have been using for years can double, triple or quadruple literally overnight. That needs to change.\u201d\n\nEvery year, the United States spends over $1,200 per person on pharmaceuticals, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That\u2019s more than double the rate in the United Kingdom and nearly double the rate in France \u2015 and yet the typical French citizen can expect to live more than four years longer than the typical American, and those in the United Kingdom enjoy three extra years, on average, relative to their American counterparts, according to the World Health Organization. The disparities are even more dramatic between the U.S. and Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn 2015, Bloomberg News compared different countries\u2019 spending on a host of major prescription drugs. A months\u2019 supply of the arthritis treatment Humira cost about $2,500 in the U.S. \u2015 roughly 50 percent more than the same supply of the same drug in Germany, and more than double the price in Canada and the U.K. The asthma medication Advair runs about $150 a month in the U.S. \u2014 roughly double the price of the same drug in Canada and triple its cost in Japan. For cutting-edge cancer drugs, prices in the U.S. exceed those in other countries by several thousand dollars per month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders and Khanna will unveil a new bill that would direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize generic competition for any name-brand drug whose average domestic cost exceeds the median price in five reference countries: Canada, the U.K., Germany, France and Japan.\n\n\u201cThe government is giving an exclusive monopoly to pharmaceuticals,\u201d Khanna told HuffPost. \u201cIf a company abuses that grant by fleecing American consumers, then they lose that privilege, that property grant, that subsidy from the government.\u201d\n\nIf the bill \u2014 dubbed The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act \u2014 were to become law, experts anticipate that drug companies would dramatically reduce prices rather than risk ceding market share to a generic competitor. \u201cNo company would want to lose its legal monopoly as a consequence of charging U.S. residents prices higher than in the reference countries,\u201d said Jamie Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that specializes in intellectual property issues.\n\nThe bill from Sanders and Khanna isn\u2019t going to become law anytime soon. It faces fervent opposition from Republicans, who will still control the Senate when Congress reconvenes next year. Even getting a vote in the House will depend on whether the Democrats in charge of key committees decide to greenlight it \u2015 a choice that will likely depend at least in part on the whims of top leadership.\n\nBut the legislation nevertheless sends a statement about the priorities of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and its intent to deliver on the campaign promises Democrats issued around the 2018 midterms, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s election night pledge to \u201ctake real, very, very strong legislative action to negotiate down the price control of prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development. We pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen\n\nPharmaceutical firms typically argue that long-term monopolies are necessary to justify the money they spend on research and development. And major drug companies do spend billions of dollars a year on R&D \u2015 but not nearly as much as they spend on marketing, meaning that most of the costs recouped by monopoly profits aren\u2019t essential to groundbreaking science. Nearly all research funded by pharmaceutical companies, moreover, piggybacks on government-backed research conducted by the National Institutes of Health. One study published earlier this year concluded that every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 relied on at least some government-funded research, reflecting over $100 billion of public investment.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a public interest nonprofit. \u201cWe pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers, and then stands aside as Big Pharma exploits those monopolies to price gouge.\u201d\n\nThe United States is in a class by itself on prescription drug costs, but the five reference countries included in the Sanders bill are a relatively generous comparison pool. Three of them \u2015 Germany, Japan and Canada \u2015 are in the top five in per-capita pharmaceutical spending among OECD nations. International reference pricing is common among wealthy nations, with 29 of 31 European Union nations taking foreign drug prices into account when considering domestic price policy, according to the European Commission.\n\nPatents on prescription drugs are a longstanding feature of both American law and international trade agreements, in part due to the outsized influence of the pharmaceutical lobby within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. But international law provides various exceptions patent-holders\u2019 privileges when it comes to public health \u2015 which is why so many countries party to the World Trade Organization and other trade treaties can obtain lower drug prices than the U.S. does. Though Khanna and Sanders crafted their bill to crack down on the monopoly, the legislation would not technically violate a drug company\u2019s patent \u2015 just change the legal substance of what that patent secured."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Inside A Shelter With The Victims Of California's Deadliest Wildfire", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-wildfires-shelter-chico_us_5bf2f75ae4b0b84243e4f085", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "CHICO, California \u2015 In Chico\u2019s East Ave Church, Pastor Ron Zimmer and his close-knit congregation are sheltering around 250 people who fled the wind-driven Camp fire last week.\n\nBefore the fire swept through the region at the rate of one football field per second, the evacuees lived just 15 miles west in the small city of Paradise and its surrounding forested towns.

Researchers hope to gather tens of thousands of responses from drug users in the U.S., which they\u2019ll use to promote safer habits and inform future debates around drug policy.\n\nThe surveys are conducted anonymously. Go here for more information on how respondents\u2019 data is used.\n\nThe Global Drug Survey is an independent research company that, since 2012, has partnered with medical experts and media groups to distribute and analyze a yearly questionnaire. Previous editions have compiled more than half a million responses from respondents in dozens of countries.\n\nThe resulting data has provided valuable insights into drug use habits. The 2017 survey showed that hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD were among the safest recreational drugs. In 2018, it revealed that a relatively large percentage of marijuana users around the world report signs of dependence.\n\nThis year\u2019s survey touches on a number of topics that are particularly relevant to Americans, said Adam Winstock, the British psychiatrist and addiction researcher who created the Global Drug Survey.\n\nThe survey includes questions about legal marijuana markets, with a particular focus on the growing popularity of cannabis edibles, which are more popular in the U.S. than anywhere, said Winstock. It will also look at consumer responses to warning labels on recreational weed products. With 10 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., now having legalized marijuana, it\u2019s important for officials to have solid data to work with when crafting rules and regulations associated with commercial sales, said Winstock.\n\nThe 2019 Global Drug Survey also asks a number of questions about sexual assault and drug use. Winstock said it was a natural topic to explore amid the Me Too movement, which has led to numerous claims against men who have allegedly sexually mistreated women. Through the survey, Winstock said he hopes to get a clearer idea of the role drugs and alcohol play in these sorts of incidents, as well as how they affect a victim\u2019s response to them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the whole issue of people not reporting because of fears that they were an unreliable witness or that police wouldn\u2019t take them seriously,\u201d said Winstock.\n\nThis year\u2019s survey will also delve into the emerging field of psychedelic therapy, in which psychedelic drugs are used to assist with psychotherapy for the treatment of mental illness.

This second speakership would make her the principal counterweight to a president she unabashedly described to me as \u201ca very dangerous man.\u201d It would also most likely be the final act of the 78-year-old legislator\u2019s long career as the most powerful woman in the history of American politics. In interviews, she has audaciously declared herself to be a \u201cmaster legislator\u201d; issued policy statements on behalf of the Democratic caucus; and implicitly dared any challenger to make themselves known while also quelling opposition to her speakership by hinting in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in October that she was open to being a \u201ctransitional figure.\u201d When I asked Pelosi about this olive branch two weeks later, however, she abruptly walked it back: \u201cI think every leader is a transitional figure.\u201d\n\nHer torrid October schedule, spanning more than two dozen cities, involved meeting with candidates whose victories on Nov. 6 were mostly all but assured, while taking care to avoid hotly contested races where the presence of one of the least popular and most reliably demonized figures in American politics might cost a Democrat votes. Pelosi had spent the previous day in Arizona, rallying volunteers and donors on behalf of Ann Kirkpatrick \u2014 a candidate who, then seven points ahead of her Republican opponent in internal polls, didn\u2019t really need Pelosi\u2019s help. But Kirkpatrick had publicly stated that she would vote for Pelosi as speaker, and Pelosi was offering a display of gratitude. And no doubt when the time came for Kirkpatrick to ask for a plum committee assignment \u2014 the Appropriations Committee happened to be her first choice \u2014 the speaker would be only too happy to demonstrate what loyalty got you with Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cShe is, in my view, the best speaker I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Obey, the cantankerous former Democratic congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who served under eight different speakers, including Pelosi, over the course of his 42-year congressional career. \u201cShe understands her caucus, and she doesn\u2019t run it like a San Francisco liberal. She runs it by trying to find its center of gravity. She works harder than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen, and I think she has more determination to stand for something than anybody I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Obey whether such skills were of any use in negotiating with a president like Trump, he acknowledged with a grunt, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s damn near an impossible task for anybody to work with him. But to the extent that it\u2019s possible, she\u2019s the one who would have the best chance. If Trump plays that game of agreeing to something and then backing off, she has the talent to unify her caucus so that they have a unified message to take to the American people \u2014 because in cases like that, only the American people can set matters straight.\u201d\n\nPelosi is something of a paradox in the world of politics. A Gallup poll five months ago found her favorability rating to be at a dismal 29 percent, and yet \u2014 unlike other unpopular political figures such as Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2014 her 31 years in public life have been free of scandal. She has been excoriated from the right as the quintessence of California limousine liberalism. But she is also a practicing Catholic whose first career was as a stay-at-home mother of five children, with little in common with \u2014 and at times little patience for \u2014 the new generation of activists in her party, to whom she sometimes refers as \u201cthe lefties.\u201d Pelosi \u2014 who with her husband, the investor Paul Pelosi, owns a large house in San Francisco\u2019s upper-crust Presidio Heights as well as a Napa Valley vineyard \u2014 is indeed rich. But 29 members of Congress, 18 of them Republicans, are richer.\n\nWhat sets her apart from other legislators of her stature is her gender. Pelosi has been known to say: \u201cNo one gives you power. You have to take it from them.\u201d The leitmotif of her three-decade ascent is that of a woman wresting power away from a male-dominated political machine, until one day the machine discovered she was its master."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "In Bosnia, Entrenched Ethnic Divisions Are a Warning to the World", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/world/europe/mostar-bosnia-ethnic-divisions-nationalism.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-20 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cYou are looking at your own future here,\u201d said Adnan Huskic, a scholar in politics and international relations at the School of Science and Technology in Sarajevo. \u201cWe have been dealing with the rise of nationalist populism for years.\u201d\n\nInstead of creating a unitary state, the 1995 agreement that halted the bloodletting in Bosnia \u2014 reached in Dayton, Ohio by the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia \u2014 only entrenched the nationalist elites that prosecuted the war.

The answer, my friends, is that the appendix is turning out to contain biologically useful tissue that may help prevent nasty gastrointestinal ills.\n\nAs long ago as 1913, a British surgeon pointed out that the appendix is a mass of lymphoid tissue that most likely protects against harmful infections. \u201cThe vermiform appendix of man is not solely a vestigial structure,\u201d Dr. Edred M. Corner wrote in The British Medical Journal. \u201cOn the contrary, it is a specialized part of the alimentary canal, Nature having made use of a disappearing structure and endowed it with a secondary function by giving it lymphoid tissue to protect the body against the micro-organisms in the ileo-caecal region.\u201d\n\nNow, a century later, researchers have provided evidence in support of Dr. Corner, contradicting longstanding medical dogma to remove the appendix, not only when it\u2019s infected, but whenever surgery for some other reason renders it accessible. Sixteen years ago, when I was about to be operated on for a strangulated intestine, I was asked if I wanted my appendix removed at the same time.\n\nMy response was \u201cHell no! It might be useful.\u201d Though I could cite no biological evidence at the time, I suspected evolution didn\u2019t produce and preserve the appendix for no reason. As it turns out, Heather F. Smith, an evolutionary biologist, and colleagues at Midwestern University in Glendale, Ariz., have found convincing evidence that \u201cthe appendix had apparently evolved independently more than 30 times in the course of mammalian evolution, suggesting that it provided some kind of adaptive advantage,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cThe appendix, with its high concentration of lymphoid tissue, stimulates and supports the immune system, especially when pathogens invade the gastrointestinal tract,\u201d she explained. Furthermore, she suggested, we could do a lot better to preserve the health-promoting potential of this tissue.\n\nDr. Smith pointed out that, although great apes, several other primates and rodents have an appendix, only humans get appendicitis, a condition that predominantly afflicts people in industrialized nations who consume a Westernized high-carbohydrate, low-fiber diet that can result in calcified carbohydrate particles becoming trapped in the opening to the appendix."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Checkup: Baby Won\u2019t Sleep Through the Night?

Their studies have found that persistent co-sleeping is associated with less happy marriages and higher stress around co-parenting, though again, this is an association; there is no way to tease out cause and effect. Mothers, he said, \u201cappear to be particularly vulnerable to losing sleep,\u201d and may accumulate chronic sleep deficits, which may affect their well-being and their functioning as parents. \u201cA lot is going to depend on how the parent is reacting or responding,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things we tell parents is pay attention to your own sleep schedules, use good sleep hygiene.\u201d\n\nSome mothers can tolerate those deficits better than others, he said. \u201cNot everyone is showing stressed co-parenting or stressed marriages.\u201d Both members of the couple need to be on board with decisions about where the baby sleeps, and how night wakings will be handled, he said, and they should make sure they are taking time to nurture their own relationship.\n\nThe new study, like many other studies of variability and temperament and the different ways to take care of children, ought to be reassuring to everyone \u2014 children develop differently and there are lots of ways to grow up and be healthy.

A full accounting would also examine the opposite. A longitudinal study of more than 38,000 people published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that standing or walking for more than six hours a day at work was associated with a doubled or tripled risk of needing surgery for varicose veins. Varicose veins are also associated with increased risks of arterial disease and heart failure.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, though, that standing at work \u2014 as with sitting too much at home \u2014 could be a marker for other unhealthy demographic factors or habits, including lower socioeconomic status. There\u2019s a difference between those who must stand or walk for most of the workday and those who can sit at any time.\n\nBut particularly for those who don\u2019t have the option to lower their desk, there is at least some evidence in that study and in others that standing for much of a workday is not healthful.\n\nA number of countries have called for more standing and less sitting at work. Some go as far as to declare \u201csitting is the new smoking.\u201d In 2013, an American Medical Association board member said, \u201cProlonged sitting, particularly in work settings, can cause health problems, and encouraging workplaces to offer employees alternatives to sitting all day will help to create a healthier work force,\u201d and suggested that standing work stations should be one of the options.\n\nToo much sitting over the course of a day is not healthy \u2014 let\u2019s be clear.

Until now, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had nothing, nothing to give these poor kids that can keep them from having these reactions and put them in a much more positive outlook on life. It\u2019s just a wonderful thing to have.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the kids were eating the equivalent of a peanut a day pretty much tells you that if they accidentally eat a peanut, they won\u2019t have a life-threatening reaction,\u201d Dr. Baker said.\n\nMichael Perkin, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatric allergy consultant at the University of London who wrote an accompanying editorial about the study, said the regimen was \u201cnot a walk in the park\u201d and requires tremendous discipline. Children are required to rest for two hours after receiving their daily dose but cannot fall asleep because of the risk of a reaction.\n\nDr. Perkin said that the long-term side effects of consuming allergens when one has a severe allergy are still unknown. But he described the results as \u201cbeyond exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a cure like an antibiotic that makes a bug go away and it\u2019s not there anymore,\u201d he said. But \u201cpsychologically it makes a massive difference if you can keep your kid from living in fear. These kids can eat enough peanut that parents no longer will have to worry about their teenage daughter kissing someone who\u2019s eaten peanut butter. You cannot estimate what a psychological relief that is.\u201d\n\nFor children like Carter Grodi, a junior in high school in Ocala, Fla., who completed the treatment a year ago and continues to ingest a small amount of peanut every day to maintain his low-level tolerance, the treatment was transformative, making it easier to go out with friends and make plans to go away for college."}]
