Wade. But they are, at a minimum, signs of what's to come should the landmark Supreme Court case get overturned.\n\n\"In a world after Roe, the voters will finally get to decide what abortion policy they support,\" said anti-abortion activist Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America , in a written statement. \"In this election, we saw people getting ready for the day in which Roe becomes a footnote in history.\"\n\nWhat the laws say\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2, which passed with 61% of votes, amends the state's Constitution \"to declare and otherwise affirm that it is the public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children ... and to provide that the constitution of this state does not protect the right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\"\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1, which passed more narrowly with 52% of votes, states that \"Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\"\n\nOregonians shot down Measure 106, which would have prohibited the use of public funds to pay for abortions except in cases in which there's a federal requirement or when the procedure is deemed \"medically necessary.\" Only 37% of voters voted for the measure, while 63% came out in opposition.\n\nWhat advocates say\n\nAnti-abortion activists were quick to applaud voters who came out against abortion and using taxpayer dollars -- like Medicaid -- to pay for abortions.\n\n\"West Virginians value life and reject abortion on demand,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List , a national anti-abortion group that launched a campaign to support the state's measure. \"Amendment 1 could spare the lives of 1,500 unborn West Virginians every year.\"\n\nAlthough the West Virginia amendment \"won't have an immediate impact,\" Julie Warden, a spokeswoman for the Vote No campaign, warned in an emailed statement that \"it is ominous for low-income women who already face insurmountable barriers to healthcare.\"\n\nShe added that options are being considered \"to ensure every West Virginian can get safe abortion care,\" no matter the amount they earn.\n\nThe Alabama amendment too \"has no immediate effect,\" said Kelly Krause, spokeswoman for the legal advocacy group Center for Reproductive Rights , but \"it sets the stage for Alabama to criminalize abortion without exception should Roe be overturned. By giving the same rights to a fetus as a person, this measure could have far-reaching consequences for contraception and in-vitro-fertilization as well. For example, emergency contraception like Plan B could be banned and couples undergoing fertility treatments could be forced to pay for the upkeep of their frozen embryos forever.\"\n\nDr. Brandi Shah, a family medicine physician in Alabama who's on the faculty of Physicians for Reproductive Health , called the amendments \"back door bans against abortion\" and warned what this could mean in if the protection of Roe v. Wade is lost.\n\n\"In Alabama, at a state level, a person's right to health care -- in this case abortion -- has been lost,\" she said in a written statement. \"The right to make life-changing decisions about pregnancy has been taken away from pregnant people even in extenuating cases of rape, incest, or risk to the life of a woman.\"\n\nThe passage of the two measures left Dr. Willie Parker, an ob/gyn, abortion provider and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, \"heartbroken for my patients and the people of Alabama and West Virginia.\"\n\n\"Abortion is health care, health care is a right,\" he said in a news release, \"and a right is not a right if every patient can't afford to access it.\"\n\nBeyond the bills\n\nThe hot-button issue of abortion extended beyond ballot measures; it helped drive support and interpretation of candidates. In this regard, both sides of the debate chose to declare victory.\n\nA representative from Americans United for Life pointed in a statement to election results in three states -- North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana -- as a positive sign.\n\n\"Voters swept Democratic senators out of office who voted against pro-life Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh,\" said Steven Aden, the anti-abortion group's chief legal officer and general counsel. \"The net result is now a strong pro-life majority in the Senate,\" which he hopes will lead to the confirmation of more anti-abortion federal judges and the passage of bills like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban late-term abortions nationwide.\n\nBut Planned Parenthood declared Tuesday's election results \"a huge victory for reproductive health and rights\" in a news release. \"Voters around the country flipped the U.S. House of Representatives to a pro-reproductive health majority, and key reproductive health champions were elected statewide,\" including the governors-elect in Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico.\n\nNewly elected officials in the mix means both sides are preparing for what's to come.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThose on the anti-abortion side vow that they will not be complacent, especially as they \"face the reality of a now pro-abortion led House of Representatives that is determined to thwart President Trump's pro-life policy agenda,\" said Dannenfelser, of the Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nAnd an abortion rights voting project, even as it celebrates its \"prochoice champions,\" sums up the new reality its side is facing.

And for as active as she was on Thursday, she receded during Tuesday arguments in a patent dispute. She asked only one question and, with her head hung low, she was at times barely able to be seen on the tall mahogany bench.\n\nA Ginsburg departure would give President Donald Trump a third nomination on the nine-seat bench and his first chance to replace a liberal with a conservative. During Barack Obama's tenure, Ginsburg resisted pressure to retire to give the Democratic president a chance to name her successor.\n\nThe potential impact of her retirement during the Trump presidency for the law in America cannot be overstated.\n\nThe public clearly understands that. News of her fall and cracked ribs -- at least the third such episode in the past six years -- made immediate headlines. \"Get well\" cards circulated digitally. People tweeted that they would give their ribs, and more, for her.\n\nThe justice, who was appointed to the court in 1993 and has been in the public eye since her women's rights advocacy in the 1970s, has responded with her own message of visibility -- to the extent she can.\n\nShe attended the funeral services for President George H.W. Bush at the Washington National Cathedral with all the other justices on Wednesday but passed up Tuesday's ceremonial arrival of Bush's flag-draped casket at the Capitol, an event at which the justices stood for the presentations.\n\nIn mid-November, she appeared at a White House ceremony for Medal of Freedom awards, where the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was her best friend on the bench and who died in February 2016, was among those honored.\n\n\"Justice Ginsburg,\" Trump said, \"glad to see you're feeling great.\"\n\nThrough her various falls and more serious health ailments over the years, Ginsburg has always made sure she was present for oral arguments, asking questions that demonstrated her deep knowledge of the of the case and law. Other justices often pick up on her lines of inquiry.\n\nGinsburg did not immediately respond to a CNN request about her health.\n\nIn 2009, a few weeks after surgery for pancreatic cancer, she showed up at Obama's televised speech to a joint session of Congress partly, she said, because she wanted people \"to see I was alive and well, contrary to that senator who said I'd be dead within nine months.\" Sen. Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican, had predicted that she could die from the pancreatic cancer within nine months. (Bunning, who later apologized, died in May 2017.)\n\nDuring Obama's second term, she brushed aside comments that she should retire, to give the Democrat a chance to make a new Supreme Court appointment. She insisted her tenure would not be tied to the politics of the day."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Roe v Wade is 'precedent,' Kavanaugh says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/LrFHHQN0YfA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Wednesday described Roe v. Wade's right to abortion as settled -- \"important precedent\" -- yet he has also narrowly interpreted when a woman can exercise that right.\n\nHis past views, reinforced by testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, suggest Kavanaugh would permit government to impose stricter regulation of abortion, for example, with additional requirements that could delay the procedure or in stiffer rules for physicians who would perform it.\n\nWith the departure of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, abortion rights could hang on Kavanaugh's vote. His critics have warned that with a new ninth justice Kavanaugh, the court would outright reverse the 1973 milestone that made abortion legal nationwide.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, abortion law would be set on a state-by-state basis, as President Donald Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh, declares he wants.\n\nIn a memo Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 which was made public Thursday, he acknowledged that the Supreme Court \"can always overrule\" Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent,\" he wrote, adding that some conservative justices then on the court \"would do so.\"\n\nRoe and abortion rights are not an all-or-nothing proposition.\n\nEven as Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, for example, have not voted to overturn Roe, they have narrowly interpreted its breadth and declined to strike down tough state restrictions on abortion.\n\nRoberts and Alito were among dissenting justices as the Supreme Court in 2016 -- with Kennedy's crucial vote in the majority -- invalidated Texas regulations on clinics and physicians that performed abortions.\n\nOn Wednesday, under questioning from Democrats, Kavanaugh declined invitations to promise he would not vote to reverse Roe, saying it would violate judicial norms to promise a vote on any particular case.\n\n\"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nBut perhaps more revealing, as he expressed regard for Roe and a 1992 decision (Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania) that reaffirmed Roe, Kavanaugh elaborated on why he dissented when his US appeals court allowed a 17-year-old woman to end her pregnancy, over objections from the Trump administration.\n\nKavanaugh had declared that the DC Circuit majority's opinion would lead to a new right for \"immediate abortion on demand.\"\n\nHis testimony Wednesday on the case, first in an exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin, offered a window into his thinking. As the Illinois Democrat asserted Kavanaugh would impose a new requirement to a woman's exercise of the abortion right, Kavanaugh emphasized his concern for the young woman who was being held in a US detention center in Texas.\n\n\"She's in an immigration facility in the United States. She's from another country. She does not speak English. She's by herself,\" Kavanaugh said, defending his view in Garza v. Hargan that the Trump administration could require her to find a sponsor before obtaining an abortion. Kavanaugh said the teen could have been able to \"consult with\" the sponsor as she faced her decision.\n\nThe DC Circuit majority found that the Trump administration was imposing an \"undue burden\" on the woman, violating her constitutional right.\n\n\"The government's conduct in the case had already forced her to delay her decision on an abortion by several weeks,\" Durbin told Kavanaugh.\n\nKavanaugh responded that he had turned to Supreme Court precedent testing laws that require a teenager to notify or get permission from a parent before obtaining an abortion. In his dissent, Kavanaugh acknowledged that, \"Those laws, of course, may have the effect of delaying an abortion.\"\n\nThe DC Circuit majority read Supreme Court precedent differently because the 17-year-old who had crossed the southern border had already fulfilled the requirements of state law for a minor trying to obtain an abortion. A Texas court had determined that she could decide what was in her best interests.\n\nKavanaugh had written that the administration was not forcing the young woman to obtain consent from a sponsor. \"It is merely seeking to place the minor in a better place when deciding whether to have an abortion,\" he said.\n\nAs Durbin noted that other judges read abortion-rights differently, Kavanaugh added, \"I did the best to follow precedent ... I did my level best in an emergency posture, I had basically two days to do this case.\"\n\nIn separate questioning on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal noted that Kavanaugh, a 12-year veteran of the DC Circuit, was not on Trump's list of Supreme Court candidates until November 2017, one month after his dissenting opinion in Garza v. Hargan. The Connecticut Democrat said it looked as if Kavanaugh landed on the list because of his view blasting what Kavanaugh described as \"abortion on demand.\"\n\nKavanaugh rejected that idea. He said he believed Trump added him to the list because \"a lot of judges and lawyers I know\" urged the consideration \"based on my record from the past 12 years.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Britain can unilaterally halt Brexit process, EU's top court rules", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/-ofTfRRGH9Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) Britain can unilaterally halt the formal process of leaving the European Union, the bloc's top court said Monday.\n\nThe European Court of Justice sided with the advice of its top legal officer, who declared last week that the UK has the power to withdraw its notification to leave the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without the agreement of other member states.\n\nThe UK can withdraw its Article 50 notification before the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the UK and the EU comes into force, the ECJ said. \"The United Kingdom is free to revoke unilaterally the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU,\" the court ruled.\n\n#ECJ: UK is free to unilaterally revoke the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU -- Case C-621/18 Wightman #Brexit pic.twitter.com/KUOI2eQ48C \u2014 EU Court of Justice (@EUCourtPress) December 10, 2018\n\nCrucially, the UK would be able to retain its current agreements with the EU, which include a rebate on financial contributions, an opt-out to the Schengen open-border zone and non-membership of the Euro.\n\n\"Such a revocation, decided in accordance with its own national constitutional requirements, would have the effect that the United Kingdom remains in the EU under terms that are unchanged as regards its status as a Member State,\" the court said.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Body found in NZ search for missing British backpacker", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/foA0gXfESBI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Auckland, New Zealand (CNN) New Zealand police searching for missing British backpacker Grace Millane say they have found a body.\n\nMillane, 22, was last seen at the Auckland city center the evening of December 1.\n\nSaturday, police said they believed Millane was dead and that a man seen with her in Auckland the night she disappeared will be charged in her death.\n\nPolice said Sunday they were conducting a full scene examination of an area in the Waitakere Ranges, West Auckland.

What happens next will be decided Monday by a Canadian court.\n\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December 1 and faces extradition to the United States. She's accused of helping Huawei, one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and networking equipment, dodge US sanctions on Iran, according to Canadian prosecutors.\n\nMeng appeared in court in Vancouver on Friday at a hearing to determine whether she should be released on bail. The judge, after hearing arguments from Meng's lawyer and the prosecutors, didn't make a decision . The hearing is set to resume Monday.\n\nThe Chinese government has started ramping up the pressure on the United States and Canada over the arrest, demanding Meng's release.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said over the weekend that it had summoned both US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and Canadian Ambassador to China John McCallum to address Meng's detention, which it described as \"lawless, reasonless and ruthless.\"\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng warned that Canada would face \"serious consequences\" if it did not release Meng immediately and expressed \"strong protest against the US's unreasonable direction to Canada\" to detain her.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nMeng, 46, is a high-profile executive at one of China's most important tech companies. In addition to her role as CFO, she serves as a deputy chairperson on Huawei's board.\n\nThe United States alleges that Meng helped Huawei get around US sanctions on Iran by telling financial institutions that a Huawei subsidiary was a separate company, according to Canadian prosecutors. The US Justice Department has declined to comment on the case.\n\nMuch rides on the outcome of her bail hearing, which continues Monday. US stocks plunged last week, in part because of Meng's arrest and uncertainty about what it means for the trade talks between the United States and China. Asian markets fell at the open on Monday and US stock futures were pointing lower.\n\nMeng's attorney David Martin argued in court Friday that she should be released on bail while she waits for an extradition hearing because of health concerns including severe hypertension.\n\nShe was taken to a hospital to be treated for hypertension after she was arrested, according to court documents.\n\nMartin also said Meng has ties to Canada and is not a flight risk. Her links to Vancouver go back at least 15 years and she has significant property holdings in the city, he added.\n\nMeng's family is seeking to remain in Vancouver if she's released on bail, according to Martin. Her husband is proposing to bring their daughter to Vancouver for school during the trial.\n\nOn Sunday, there was a break in at Meng's Vancouver home. Police are investigating, according to a source familiar with the probe.\n\nHuawei hopeful courts will reach 'right conclusion'\n\nMartin also claimed the case against Meng had not been fully laid out, even though the United States signed off on her arrest warrant months ago. A US federal judge issued a warrant for her arrest on August 22.\n\nThe attorney argued that Meng wouldn't breach any court order to remain in Canada because doing so would embarrass her personally, and would also humiliate her father, Huawei and China itself.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, Huawei said: \"We will continue to follow the bail hearing on Monday. We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach the right conclusion.\"\n\nThe company has said it was \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng\" and that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates.\"\n\nShould Meng's extradition to the United States go ahead, the process could take months.\n\nThe United States has 60 days from the date of a provisional arrest to provide Canada with its formal extradition request and supporting documents. Canada's Justice Department then has 30 days to weigh the request and greenlight an extradition hearing in which the request is weighed by a judge."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'I can't breathe.'

Turkish officials believe the calls were placed to senior figures in Riyadh, briefing them on progress.\n\nSome of the details in the transcript seen by CNN's source have emerged in previous reports of the recording's content. But this is the fullest account of the transcript that has so far been published.\n\nIt is likely to increase pressure on the Trump administration, which has been determined to separate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from the murder, and sought to frame the issue as a binary choice between supporting or cutting off a key partner in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump has been at odds with the CIA, which, sources say, has concluded bin Salman personally ordered the killing.\n\nThe revelations also threaten to undermine a key plank of an initial Saudi explanation for Khashoggi's death, that it was a rogue operation that went horribly wrong.\n\nThe original transcript of the audio was prepared by Turkish intelligence services . Turkish officials have never said how they obtained the audio. The transcript would have been translated before it was shared with other intelligence services; CNN's source read a translated version and has been briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe office of one US senator, who has received a briefing on the investigation by CIA Director Gina Haspel, told CNN that the source's recollections of the transcript are \"consistent\" with that briefing.\n\nCNN asked Saudi officials to comment on the contents of the transcript as described by the source, and to provide comment from those named in it. A Saudi official said: \"The relevant Saudi security officials have reviewed the transcript and tape materials through Turkish security channels and nowhere in them is there any reference or indication of a call being made.\"\n\n\"If there is additional information Turkish authorities have that we are unaware of, we would welcome it being officially handed over to us for review, which we have requested numerous times and are still requesting. And, up until now; we have not received anything.\" The official did not address the transcript's characterization of the scene inside the Saudi consulate, nor Khashoggi's last words.\n\nA security camera image shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\n'You are coming back'\n\nThe transcript begins at the moment Khashoggi enters the Saudi consulate in a quiet residential district of Istanbul at lunchtime on October 2.\n\nKhashoggi thought he had made a routine appointment to pick up papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. But, according to the source, it dawns upon Khashoggi almost immediately that things are not going to plan, when he recognizes one of the men who meets him.\n\nHe asks the man what he is doing there.\n\nAccording to CNN's source, a voice identified in the transcript as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a former Saudi diplomat and intelligence official working for bin Salman, and known to Khashoggi from their time together at the Saudi Embassy in London, addresses him.\n\n\"You are coming back,\" the man says.\n\n\"You can't do that,\" Khashoggi replies. \"People are waiting outside.\"\n\n(Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e accompanied him as far as the consulate, with instructions to call associates if he did not emerge.)\n\nWithout any further dialogue, according to the source, the transcript indicates that several people set upon Khashoggi.\n\nNoises follow, and very quickly Khashoggi is fighting for air.\n\nIn one version of the evolving explanations for his death, Saudi officials suggested Khashoggi was accidentally choked. But according to the transcript, CNN's source says, the journalist's voice can be heard above the noise, repeatedly claiming he could not breathe.\n\nDespite his desperate pleas, the last discernible words the transcript records for Khashoggi are:\n\n\"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThe transcript notes more noises, and several more voices.\n\nOne of those voices is identified on the transcript by Turkish authorities as belonging to Dr. Salah Muhammad al-Tubaiqi, the head of forensic medicine at Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, the source says.\n\nAside from Khashoggi and Mutreb, he is the only other voice identified by name on the transcript.\n\nAs the transcript continues, it is clear Khashoggi is not yet dead.\n\nThe transcript notes the noises that can be heard on the tape, almost in the manner that subtitles describe moments in movies where there is no dialogue.\n\n\"Scream.\"\n\n\"Scream.\"\n\n\"Gasping.\"\n\nThen, the transcript notes other descriptions.\n\n\"Saw.\"\n\n\"Cutting.\"\n\nTubaiqi is noted giving some advice to other people in the room, apparently to help them deal with the appalling task.\n\n\"Put your earphones in, or listen to music like me.\"\n\nDuring the scene, the transcript notes at least three phone calls placed by Mutreb.\n\nThe transcript does not specify the moment Khashoggi dies.\n\nAccording to the source, the transcript suggests Mutreb is updating someone, whom Turkish officials say was in Riyadh, with almost step-by-step details of what is taking place.\n\n\"Tell yours, the thing is done, it's done.\"\n\nThe word \"yours\" is taken by CNN's source to refer to a superior, or boss.\n\nThe transcript has been circulated to key Turkish and Saudi allies , including those in Europe, but only the United States and Saudi Arabia have received the recording itself, the source believes.\n\nThe working assumption among those allies is that Mutreb was talking to Saud al-Qahtani, bin Salman's closest aide, the source said. Saudi officials say al-Qahtani has been removed from his former position as media chief to the crown prince.\n\nThe transcript only records Mutreb's side of the conversation. Without a recording of that call, or more details of which number was called, further conclusions based on the transcript alone cannot be made.\n\nA portrait of Jamal Khashoggi during a remembrance ceremony for him in Washington on November 2.\n\nA source close to the Saudi investigation into Khashoggi's killing told CNN that Mutreb and Tubaiqi deny making any phone calls.\n\nCNN has previously reported how Mutreb, Tubaiqi and 13 other Saudis arrived in Istanbul by private charter jets and commercial aircraft on the day of and the days leading up to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nTurkish surveillance video records the 15-man hit team arriving at the consulate shortly before Khashoggi, and departing a few hours later. A body double of Khashoggi dressed in Khashoggi's clothes is seen on CCTV leaving by the back door.\n\nIt is clear from the transcript of the phone conversation that the calls do not describe a terrible situation gone awry, or explain an unexpected set of circumstances, the source says. Instead, the caller appears simply to be informing someone of what is going on. Hardly, the source says, the actions of a panicked ringleader, but more the description of a situation going entirely according to plan.\n\nThe transcript is relatively short, given the time span it describes, the source told CNN. There is not much dialogue; certainly no hint of a conversation about why Khashoggi should go \"back,\" and no suggestion either, as advanced at one point by Saudi officials, that he had been drugged by the hit team.\n\nThere is nothing in this transcript that the source could describe as a \"smoking gun\" -- a snippet of conversation or phone call that directly ties bin Salman to the so-called hit team, and to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham on Khashoggi: Crown Prince 'complicit' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham on Khashoggi: Crown Prince 'complicit' 02:00\n\nBut the lasting conclusion the source drew from the transcript is that Khashoggi's killing was a planned assassination by an organized team that carried out its job with ruthless efficiency, keeping someone in Riyadh informed at each step.\n\nWhile the transcript provides no smoking gun directly tying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the killing, it seems to echo Sen. Lindsey Graham's sentiments after hearing the CIA's assessment of Khashoggi's killing.\n\nGraham, who was among a group of senators to receive a classified briefing on the Khashoggi case, said earlier this week that he agreed with the conclusions of the US security services that bin Salman was implicated in the case.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Trump brand now toxic in Putin's Kremlin", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/AUDAnT8io-s/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Moscow (CNN) Gatherings of world leaders are often about the absence of substance. Several news cycles from now, few will remember what was discussed at the recent G20 summit in Buenos Aires.\n\nNever mind that US lawmakers and other world leaders have castigated the Saudi crown prince over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Putin's embrace of MBS telegraphed a message of unabashed support for Saudi Arabia, even as the Trump administration tries to contain the political fallout from the murder.\n\nPutin is certainly one to sense an opening. His personal outreach builds upon a burgeoning oil alliance between Moscow and Riyadh . Perhaps more importantly, it comes as his well-established rapport with US President Donald Trump is starting to look a little bit wobbly.\n\nAnd it accompanies a confrontation with the US over arms control: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced this week that the US will stop adhering to a decades-old nuclear treaty in 60 days unless Russia returns to compliance with the agreement.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the Helsinki summit in July 2018.\n\nPointed snub to Putin\n\nHow quickly things have changed since the Helsinki summit in July. Less than half a year ago, Trump stunned observers by appearing to side with Putin over the US intelligence community, saying he took the Kremlin leader at his word over his denials of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe G20 summit was originally billed as a sort of Helsinki 2.0: Trump and Putin were supposed to have a lengthy meeting on the sidelines of the summit, where they would have wide-ranging discussions about matters of strategic importance.\n\nThat bilateral meeting, however, was scuttled after an incident around the Kerch Strait, where Russian and Ukrainian vessels clashed at sea on November 25. The confrontation between Kiev and Moscow quickly ramped up: Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 service members, and Trump cancelled his meeting with Putin , saying it would be inappropriate for him to meet while the crisis was unresolved.\n\nIt was a pointed snub to Putin, who said it was a \"pity\" that he was unable to have a full-fledged meeting with Trump, because, as he put it, \"the time is ripe particularly with the problems around strategic stability.\"\n\nTrump's volte-face came after his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen leveled fresh allegations in court about the President's business dealings with Russia. And the Russians were quick to cast doubt on Trump's reasons for canceling the bilateral meeting.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova last week suggested that the \"US domestic political situation\" was the real reason for the cancellation of the G20 meeting.\n\n\"Was the provocation organized by Kiev in this region the real reason for cancellation?\" Zakharova said, referring to the Kerch incident. \"Publicly, we heard just such an explanation, we took note of it. Is this a reality? I think that you still need to look for answers in the US domestic political situation. The dominant factor in making a decision is domestic political realities in the US.\"\n\nKremlin-aligned Russian media had a field day with Trump's cancellation.\n\nPro-Putin news anchor Dmitry Kiselev highlighted the Putin-MBS high-five on his program, adding: \"A dissonant contrast to everyone's mood was Trump, looking morose, sitting there with crossed hands as if he is trying to shield himself from everyone else, scared of blurting out something unnecessary. Looks like he was just not prepared for a coherent meeting with Putin.\"\n\nVladimir Soloviev, another pro-Kremlin presenter, took a similar dig at Trump.\n\n\"Trump's volatility and unpredictability is the new brand of the White House,\" he said.\n\nReset that never came\n\nIn terms of Russia's perception of Trump, things have come a long way since the 2016, when his election victory was treated as a potential breakthrough in Russian-American relations.\n\nKonstantin Kosachev, a Russian senator who is chair of the Federation Council's Committee on Foreign Affairs, summed up the new Russian pessimism about Trump and the United States in an interview with CNN. Like many Russian official observers of the American political scene, Kosachev believes Trump is hamstrung by the ongoing probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"The current American policy towards Russia is not about Russia or the foreign policy of the United States,\" he said. \"It's about the domestic policy of the United States. America is still captured by these disagreements and emotions from the previous presidential campaign. Mr. Trump is being heavily attacked. And one of the tracks of this attack is the Russian meddling in the American elections, which has never been proved by any evidence. So, I believe that our bilateral relations are kept hostage by certain internal political interests of certain political forces inside the US. And I am afraid we will trapped in this situation until the next presidential election.\"\n\nIt's a pivotal moment in Washington, with special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday outlining a previously undisclosed set of overtures and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals.\n\nFederal prosecutors said for the first time that Michael Cohen acted at the direction of Trump when the former fixer committed two election-related crimes during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSeparately, Mueller said Friday that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied about five major issues after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, including his \"contact with administration officials.\"\n\nThe accusations by Mueller add to growing signs that the special counsel's team has a wealth of evidence about contacts between people close to Trump -- even in the White House -- and Russians during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIt also comes after Mueller told a federal court that Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, had given \"substantial assistance\" to the Russia investigation and should not receive jail time.\n\nBut with the Mueller probe coming to a head, Russia's line has been consistent: There was no meddling, therefore the probe is groundless.\n\nAsked in a conference call this week with reporters to comment on the Mueller probe, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was dismissive.\n\n\"We have enough other concerns, so this is not a priority topic for our attention, frankly speaking,\" he said. \"I do not know what kind of breakthroughs there could be. That [information] now available to the public in many respects is mystifying and a raises a huge number of questions, we have repeatedly cited examples of the absurdity of such accusations.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Flights canceled and power out after Southeast storm", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/ZP_hUIsEEZs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The brunt of the storm may have passed, but North Carolina residents still face perilous conditions after record-setting snow walloped the state.\n\n\"With a mix of snow, ice and rain still coming down in some areas, conditions remain treacherous in many parts of our state,\" Gov.

Whether they're important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question,\" Nadler said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"But certainly, they're impeachable offenses, because, even though they were committed before the President became President, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office.\"\n\nWhile it appears unlikely that Democrats would seek to impeach Trump solely on the basis of campaign finance violations, recent weeks have made clear that Mueller's investigation is broader than was publicly evident and could find worse alleged transgressions by the President and those around him.\n\nFor months, the line from the Trump White House has been that there was \"no collusion\" in a Russian election meddling effort in 2016.\n\nBut the special counsel investigation is now uncovering multiple approaches by Russians to the Trump campaign and revealing the openness of key figures to those approaches and their propensity to lie about the contacts.\n\nSo there is a genuine possibility that the next chief of staff could find himself presiding over a White House embroiled in an impeachment drama \u2014 and leading a war room battling to maintain GOP support for the President in the event that he would go on trial in the Senate.\n\nWhite House under scrutiny\n\nJust days after the President said there was nothing wrong with pursuing a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow while he was a private citizen, Mueller suggested there might be.\n\nFrom court filings, it appears the special counsel believes that it was relevant that Trump was pursuing a deal with hundreds of millions at stake, which may have needed the help of a foreign power -- Russia -- that was at the same actively interfering in the election and had developed a preference for his candidacy.\n\nAnd it is now clear that Mueller's probe into alleged obstruction of justice by the President runs far deeper than the events surrounding the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The revelation that Mueller recently interviewed Kelly, reported by CNN, as well as last week's court documents, make clear that activity in the White House in 2017 and 2018 is also under scrutiny. That's because Kelly did not even take the job until July 2017 -- two months after Comey was fired.\n\nMueller has so far not made any direct accusations against the President or senior officials. But embedded in recent court filings is the possibility that he is looking at whether there were efforts by the administration to thwart investigations by his team and Congress.\n\nFor instance, in a sentencing memo, Cohen's lawyers said their client was in \"close and regular contact\" with White House staff and Trump's lawyers ahead of congressional testimony in which Cohen lied by saying the proposed Moscow project was off the table by the time of the Iowa caucuses in 2016.\n\nMueller's filings also note that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was in touch with senior officials even after he was indicted.\n\nThis all makes it clear that after months when Mueller was dealing with Trump associates from his past life as a businessman and on the campaign, his investigation is now penetrating the White House itself and is interested in events that took place long after the campaign ended.\n\nTrump's defenders correctly argue that Mueller has yet to directly accuse the President of any criminal actions. And it is often overlooked that Mueller's filings are the work of a prosecutor who by definition is making the best possible presentation of a case not yet challenged in court.\n\nBut the direction of Mueller's investigation appears clear. He is getting closer and closer to the President and his inner circle.\n\nAnd sooner or later it will be up to the next chief of staff to navigate the White House through a crisis that could put his boss's presidency in existential danger."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Inside the field of wary contenders for Trump's top job", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/mXpNFjd283U/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "And with the surprise decision by Nick Ayers to turn the job down, Trump is left with, roughly, bupkis when it comes to obvious second choices.\n\nThere is no denying that fact unless, of course, you are Donald Trump.\n\n\"I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff,\" he tweeted Sunday night. \"Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nIf you believe that this is all going according to plan, then you may have missed the last two years of the Trump presidency. This is a President who freelances, disassembles and denies at every turn. He wanted Ayers. Ayers didn't want to commit for two years. That's the story.\n\nBut regardless of how we got here, here we are!\n\nSo who will Trump's next chief of staff be? The real truth is that no one knows because a) this a President who tends to wing it and b) everyone expected Ayers to take the job. There is a list of names kicking around, however.\n\nI've taken the most oft-mentioned contenders and broken down each one's chances -- based on what we know of Trump, what message choosing that person would send, how much disruption it would cause etc. -- below. To be clear: Whether Trump settles on one of these names or not, that person will not likely survive terribly long in the job. Being chief of staff is a difficult gig -- President Barack Obama had five in his eight years as president -- that is made practically impossible when the President is Donald Trump.\n\n1. Mick Mulvaney\n\nAlong with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman, has been the biggest success story of the Trump administration. His star has risen quickly and he now holds two jobs: He is the head of the Office of Management and Budget and the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mulvaney is more press-friendly -- and skilled in communicating with the press -- than Kelly, and is a proven cable TV performer (also unlike Kelly). Both of those traits are major arguments for Mulvaney in the eyes of Trump.\n\nThe problem? Mulvaney doesn't appear to want the job. \"He's not interested in chief of staff,\" a source close to Mulvaney told CNN's Rebecca Buck. \"He has been saying for almost two months that he would be more interested in something like Commerce or Treasury, if that's where the President needed him.\"\n\n2. Steve Mnuchin\n\nMnuchin is one of the few people in the administration that Trump regards if not as his equal than with a measure of respect and admiration. Why? Because Mnuchin made lots and lots of money and is viewed as very bright and successful in the world of finance.\n\nThe issue with Mnuchin is that he comes with some baggage and he -- and his wife, Louise Linton -- have shown something of a tin ear for appearances and politics since coming to Washington. Speaking of politics, Mnuchin is something of a neophyte to campaigns and elections, a trait that Trump had reportedly grown weary of in Kelly. Does the President really want a political n00b as his top adviser as he prepares to run for reelection in 2020?\n\n3. Mark Meadows\n\nMeadows, the North Carolina congressman and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, is the most Trump-y of all the potential chief of staff candidates -- and would likely cause the most controversy if picked. (Like I said, the most Trump-y.) Meadows is not terribly well-liked by House members -- even (and maybe especially) Republicans. To the extent that the chief of staff's job is serve as a sort of liaison or bridge between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Meadows could struggle.\n\nBut if the job is primarily to provide an ear to listen to Trump -- and to agree with him and his approach -- then Meadows could be the right pick.\n\nThis debate could be immaterial because Meadows is reportedly telling associates \"absolutely not\" when it comes to the chief of staff job, according to CNN's Jeff Zeleny.\n\n4. Robert Lighthizer\n\nIf you don't know the name, you can be forgiven: The US trade representative is not exactly a high-profile figure in political Washington. But Lighthizer is an old hand (he's 71) who has a pedigree of having worked with then-President Ronald Reagan -- and Trump likes that. He also likely maintains solid contact among Senate Republicans from his time as chief of staff at the Senate Finance Committee under Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kans.).\n\nLighthizer's tendency to avoid the limelight could be, weirdly, a strike against him in the world of Trump. Trump likes his top staffers out on TV making the case for him, selling the Trump brand at all times. Would an old Washington behind-the-scenes hand really fit the Trump model?\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt is possible, of course, that Trump picks none of these people, none of these people want the job if picked and/or Trump can't convince any of them to take the job. Which, in and of itself, is remarkable. The job of White House chief of staff has long been one of the most prestigious and powerful gigs in Washington. Hell, Rahm Emanuel resigned as a member of Congress to take the job as Barack Obama's chief of staff!\n\nBecause Trump is Trump -- unpredictable, never satisfied and a big fan of scapegoating -- the job of being the man (or woman) next to the man has been considerably devalued. Yet another presidential norm that Donald Trump has broken."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Accused Russian spy Maria Butina appears to reach plea deal", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/jH9sRnhX2jg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Maria Butina, an accused Russian spy who nuzzled up to the National Rifle Association before the 2016 election, appears to have reached a plea deal with the Justice Department, according to a new court filing in her criminal case.\n\nHer attorneys and prosecutors filed a two-page request on Monday for a \"change of plea\" hearing before a federal judge as soon as Tuesday. \"The parties have resolved this matter,\" the filing in DC federal court said Monday morning. Butina's case was brought by federal prosecutors in DC and not by Robert Mueller's team in the special counsel's office.\n\nA plea hearing has not yet been set. The notice Monday comes after several weeks of hints that Butina might negotiate an end to her case -- and after bumps in the case where federal prosecutors, at the height of attention on Russia's influence in American politics, accused the former graduate student of infiltrating Republican organizations in order to advance Russian interests.\n\nUntil now, Butina, 30, maintained her innocence and insisted she was simply a foreign student interested in bettering relations between the US and Russia. Butina previously pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy and a second count of acting as an agent of a foreign government when she was arrested in July.\n\nHer case first became public amid a furor of US-Russia developments. She was arrested two days after the Justice Department separately indicted Russian military intelligence for hacking the Democratic Party, and her case became public the same day President Donald Trump met with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declined to endorse US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nButina's case at first appeared to allege she attempted to do just that -- with prosecutors suggesting she offered sex to gain political access and sought out Trump campaign officials. But prosecutors later admitted they made an error in interpreting the text messages they used as evidence to support their claim that she was trading sex for access, drawing a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case.\n\nAt a bail hearing in July, in which a judge determined she should be jailed to avoid her fleeing to Russia with the help of Russian diplomats, her attorney argued that her case shouldn't be a proxy fight for US-Russian relations.\n\nIt is still unclear if Butina fits into a broader picture of investigations into Russian infiltration in US politics, however, or if she will agree to cooperate in other federal investigations as part of her plea deal.\n\nPrior to her arrest, Butina signaled she would be willing to cooperate with investigators on other probes, such as a fraud investigation in South Dakota into her boyfriend, the American conservative political operative Paul Erickson. Immediately after her arrest, she became unwilling to help.\n\nProsecutors in their criminal complaint accused Butina of ingratiating herself with politically powerful Americans and groups, including the NRA, and exploiting those connections to try to advance Russian interests. They alleged she was in regular contact with her Russian backers, including Alexander Torshin, a Kremlin-linked banker who has been sanctioned by the US Treasury and that she made contact with Russian intelligence. At one court hearing, prosecutors showed a photo of her dining with a Russian diplomat just north of the embassy just before that man, a suspected intelligence officer, left the US amid a purge of Russian agents.\n\nProsecutors said Torshin compared her to Anna Chapman, another accused Russian spy who was deported from the US in a prisoner swap in 2010, and that she tried to establish \"back channel\" lines of communications with American politicians and met Republican leaders as \"a representative of informal diplomacy\" before the 2016 election.\n\nThe contacts with Americans involved in politics lasted throughout her tenure as a graduate student at American University, according to prosecutors. They had cast her studies as little more than a cover for her spy work.\n\nBy changing her plea, Butina will likely be forced to return to Russia upon release from jail. She is currently being held in solitary confinement in a northern Virginia jail. She and her lawyer have repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, argued that she should be released on house arrest or at least moved out of solitary confinement.\n\nEven under scrutiny from federal investigators, Erickson has continued to visit Butina in jail. He has not been charged with a crime."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "At least 16 Trump associates had contacts with Russians during campaign or transition", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MpJdQnAOKs4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) At least 16 associates of Donald Trump had contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign or transition, according to public statements, court filings, CNN reporting, and reporting from other news outlets.\n\nThese communications came in the form of face-to-face meetings, phone calls, text messages, emails and video chats.\n\nIn the months after the election, Trump and his senior officials repeatedly denied that there had been any contact whatsoever with Russians during the campaign or that there were any ties between the campaign and Russians.\n\nEveryone on this list denies participating in any \"collusion\" with the Russians.\n\n1.

Because of these restrictions, these tests miss as many patients with hereditary cancers as they find, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\n\"Unfortunately, insurance companies pay attention to these guidelines,\" said Dr. Peter Beitsch , co-author of the study and a cancer surgeon practicing in Texas. Insurance companies and other payers reimburse genetic testing -- or not -- based on the guidelines.\n\nThe result: Patients without genetic test results might not receive the appropriate treatment for their cancer, which could be a matter of life or death.\n\nApproximately 330,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States and of these cases, an estimated 10% are likely due to hereditary causes, according to Beitsch.\n\nThe guidelines are two decades old\n\nThe guidelines for the genetic testing of breast cancer patients were established about 20 years ago by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network , a nonprofit alliance of 28 cancer centers dedicated to improving patient care, explained Beitsch, who is a co-founder of the TME Breast Care Network, a nonprofit focused exclusively on advancing treatment for breast cancer patients.\n\n\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said. \"Back then we tested for two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA 2 ,\" said Beitsch. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are tumor suppressor genes that everyone has; if a defect or mutation occurs in one or both of these genes, the likelihood of breast cancer is increased.\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said.\n\nSince then it has become known that 11 \"major\" gene mutations, including BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, can cause breast cancer, while 25 or 30 other genetic variants are also linked to the disease, said Beitsch.\n\nMeanwhile, genetic testing \"radically changed. It went from a difficult-to-do, and expensive, test to a quite inexpensive test,\" said Beitsch. \"The cost dropped from, say, $5,000 for two genes to now we're doing 80 genes for about $250.\"\n\nWhile the guidelines also evolved, they \"got incredibly complicated,\" he said: \"unusable.\"\n\nSo Beitsch and his colleagues set up a study to look at nearly a thousand female breast cancer patients, half who met the criteria set forth in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the other half who did not. Among 959 study participants, all underwent a full panel of DNA testing for hereditary breast cancer.\n\nThe results showed that 83 women or 8.65% of the total participants, had breast cancer-linked genetic defects. Of these, 45 women met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria for testing, while 38 women did not. Ordinarily, then, these 38 women would not have been tested.\n\nGenetic testing may be a matter of life or death\n\nMany women who have breast cancer do not meet the criteria under the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, said Beitsch, and this affects their treatment and, potentially, their survival.\n\nDr. Otis Brawley , a professor in the department of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Emory University School of Medicine, explained that when a patient with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation is diagnosed, \"We treat them differently from a person with no known mutation.\" For example, surgical decisions and the use of chemotherapy might be based on whether a woman has a genetic mutation.\n\n\"Over the past 20 years we are learning of a number of genes that can have a mutation. Some change our treatment,\" said Brawley, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nGenetic testing, then, is not only important to a patient's survival, Beitsch said, \"but also for her family members as well.\" Carrying the same genetic mutation, a female relative may be at increased risk for breast cancer, while male relatives may be at increased risk for prostate and other cancers.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said that \"it's a misconception that men cannot be impacted by BRCA genes and it's a misconception that they cannot pass them onto their children.\"\n\n\"There's no question we don't test the people we know should be tested,\" including some patients with a \"family history that has cancer written all over it. Unfortunately, too many professionals don't pay attention,\" said Lichtenfeld, who did not contribute to the new research. One study, for example, suggests that fewer than one in five people who meet National Cancer Comprehensive Network criteria and have a history of breast cancer have actually undergone genetic testing.\n\n\"Then there's the group of people without a family history who want to get tested,\" he said.\n\nWill we all be routinely tested in the future?\n\npeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test. 2016 survey suggests that more than half -- 56% -- of American adults would be interested in taking a genetic test that indicated the likelihood of their developing cancer. The 30 to 64 age group had the highest proportion of willingpeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test.\n\nDespite public interest and increasing knowledge of potential causes of cancer, insurance plans do not routinely cover the expense of medical genetic testing, said Lichtenfeld. And barriers exist even for those who most need to know the results of such tests, such as some women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, he said: \"Once [a woman] is diagnosed, unless she has a family history, a lot of payers, including Medicare, will not pay for the test.\"\n\nSome patients pay for the testing on their own, but this is not possible for all patients. And some patients may be unaware of the need for medical genetic tests because the guidelines do not recommend they get it.\n\nSince genetic tests are now relatively inexpensive, the reason for creating an \"economic roadblock\" no longer exists, Beitsch said, and so the guidelines should \"be wiped.\"\n\n\"The guidelines really don't help -- in fact, they hurt, they injure, they keep people who could benefit from genetic testing from getting it,\" said Beitsch, who hopes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network will recognize his study \"and take heed of it and hopefully change the guidelines.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLichtenfeld said cancer centers \"are finding many more people who have a hereditary basis for their cancer than would have been suspected based on our previous knowledge.\" Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, scientists have become increasingly adept at reading the mysterious code and what \"we don't understand today, we will understand tomorrow or next year or in the next decade,\" said Lichtenfeld. He believes that soon, genetic testing will be routine for newborns.\n\nBased on his new research, Beitsch cherishes a more modest hope that at the very least all breast cancer patients will be offered and reimbursed for genetic testing, and perhaps, the same for all cancer patients."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot for this mild season", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/02XttMre86w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot this season, according to a new survey from NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs of mid-November, only 43% of surveyed people 18 or older said they had gotten vaccinated against the flu, according to NORC, which has conducted the National Immunization Survey for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2005. Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health.

It is also now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.\n\nOn average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied.

To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.\n\nThe \"multitude of factors\" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.\n\n\"Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),\" WHO noted.

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.\n\nThe air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area.

That is almost twice the volume of all the oceans.\n\nBacteria and archaea (microbes with no membrane-bound nucleus) dominate.

And because these underground organisms persist far from sunlight they must exploit chemosynthesis - as opposed to photosynthesis - to nourish themselves. The minerals in the rocks around them are their larder.\n\nThe role all these organisms play in shifting carbon about the Earth is profound, according to the DCO's executive director, Bob Hazen.\n\n\"You cannot understand carbon on Earth without understanding the diversity and influence of life. Cells turn over carbon - they take carbon in, they breathe it out.

Could other planets and moons have subterranean ecosystems?\n\nWhat are the implications of this research?\n\nAnother aspect of the research is what is says about the absolute limits of life on Earth in terms of temperature, pressure, and the availability of energy.\n\n\"The current known upper-limit for life is 122 degrees Celsius, which happens to be the temperature of sterilisation equipment we typically use in labs,\" said Dr Lloyd.\n\n\"But there's no-one I know who thinks that's the theoretical limit. For example, we know some of the problems associated with high temperatures, such as the disordering of lipids and membranes, is at least partially compensated by higher pressures. Which means it's possible we could find even higher temperature organisms the deeper we go down.\"\n\nAnd this has clear implications for the possibility that life exists somewhere else in the Solar System, adds Prof Colwell.\n\n\"I think it's probably reasonable to assume that the subsurface of other planets and their moons are habitable, especially since we've seen here on Earth that organisms can function far away from sunlight using the energy provided directly from the rocks deep underground,\" he told BBC News.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Grace Millane: Man appears in court charged with backpacker's murder", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-46502649", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:26", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Lucie Blackman Trust Image caption The 22-year-old arrived in New Zealand in mid-November for the second part of her round-the-world trip\n\nA 26-year-old man has appeared in court in New Zealand charged with the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane.\n\nMiss Millane, 22, disappeared in Auckland on 1 December - police ended their search on Sunday after finding a body in the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe man, who cannot be named, is due back in court next month.\n\nCourt documents showed he had been living at the Citylife Hotel on Queen Street in central Auckland, which is where Miss Millane was last seen.\n\nThe judge acknowledged Miss Millane's family's grief \"must be desperate\".\n\nDocuments also showed police believe the University of Lincoln graduate from Essex was killed between 1 December and 2 December.\n\nAt a news conference, the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there was an \"overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country\".\n\n\"On behalf on New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace's family,\" she said. \"Your daughter should have been safe here, and she wasn't, and I'm sorry for that.\"\n\nThe body - which has not yet been formally identified but the police believe to be Miss Millane's - was found \"about 10 metres\" off Scenic Drive, a countryside road outside the city, Det Insp Scott Beard said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jacinda Ardern held back tears as she commented on the murder of British tourist Grace Millane\n\nOn Sunday, Declan Millane, one of Miss Millane's brothers, shared a collection of photographs of his sister online, alongside the lyrics to the chorus of the song You Are My Sunshine.\n\nThe University of Lincoln, from which Miss Millane graduated earlier this year, paid tribute and said its community was \"deeply saddened\".\n\nFloral tributes for the recent graduate have been growing outside the Willows Centre in her home town of Wickford.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A tribute at the roadside at the start of Scenic Drive\n\nMiss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following a six-week group trip through South America.\n\nThe announcement on Saturday by police that Miss Millane was \"no longer alive\" followed a review of CCTV footage, the forensic examination of a hotel where she was last seen, and the discovery of a vehicle.\n\nDet Insp Beard issued an appeal for anybody who saw a red Toyota Corolla rental car, which had been hired from a company in Auckland, between 06:30 and 09:30 local time on Monday 3 December.\n\nPolice said her family were \"devastated\" after being told the missing persons case had become a murder investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Auckland on Friday, Grace's father, David Millane, described his daughter as \"lovely\" and \"family-orientated\".\n\nHe added that his daughter had been \"bombarding us with numerous photographs and messages of her adventures\" before she went missing.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has added his condolences on Twitter, saying: \"Grace Millane's murder was an unspeakable tragedy that has shaken us all.\"\n\nHe also thanked the New Zealand prime minister \"for standing shoulder to shoulder with the UK with such grace and dignity which speaks volumes for the deep friendship between our countries\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The body was found in an area of woodland in the Waitakere Ranges, which is a region of rainforest and beaches west of Auckland popular with hikers\n\nTimeline of Grace Millane's disappearance\n\n20 November: Grace Millane arrives in New Zealand after visiting Peru as part of her year-long round-the-world trip.\n\n1 December, 19:00 local time: Miss Millane is seen on Victoria Street in the city centre of Auckland.

This indicated that it had crossed the \"heliopause\" - the term for the outer edge of the Sun's protective bubble of particles and magnetic field.\n\nAnd while its twin craft beat it to this boundary, the US space agency says that Voyager 2 has a working instrument aboard that will provide \"first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway into interstellar space\".\n\nThe probe's present location is some 18 billion km (11 billion miles) from Earth. It is moving at roughly 54,000km/h (34,000mph). Voyager 1 is further and faster still, at 22 billion km and 61,000km/h.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The probes were launched to explore the outer planets, but have just kept going\n\nDid the the team plan to explore beyond the Solar System?\n\nThe Voyagers were sent initially to study the outer planets, but then just kept on going.\n\nProf Stone said that at the start of the mission the team had no idea how long it would take them to reach the edge of the Sun's protective bubble, or heliosphere.\n\n\"We didn't know how large the bubble was, how long it would take to get there and if the space craft would last long enough,\" he added. \"Now we're studying the very local interstellar medium.\n\n\"It's a very exciting time in Voyager's 41 year journey.\"\n\nScientists define the Solar System in different ways, so Prof Stone has always been very careful not to use the exact phrase \"leave the Solar System\" in relation to his spacecraft. He is mindful that the Nasa probes still have to pass through the Oort cloud where there are comets gravitationally bound to the Sun, albeit very loosely.\n\nBut both Voyagers certainly are in a new, unexplored domain of space.\n\nHow long has this journey taken?\n\nDecades and billions of kilometres. Voyager 1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager 2.\n\nThe pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989.\n\nThey were then steered towards deep space. It is expected that their plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their 20W transmitters will die.\n\nThe Voyager project manager, Suzanne Dodd told BBC News that she would like to see them both keep going until 2027.\n\n\"It would be super-exciting to have a 50-year mission still operating,\" she added, describing the probes as \"pioneers\" of interstellar space.\n\n\"Every so often they phone home and say - 'I'm still going. Don't forget about me!'\"\n\nImage caption The Sun sits in an extensive bubble of hot gas called the heliosphere\n\nVoyager 1 will not approach another star for nearly 40,000 years, even though it is moving at such great speed.

alternative to leasehold tenancies has been urged by the government's law reform adviser.\n\nCommonhold - where people own their homes without an expiring lease - was introduced 14 years ago, but has been little-used.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been widespread complaints about the leasehold system.\n\nThe Law Commission wants commonhold to be more widely available in England and Wales and is consulting on reforms.\n\nUnder a leasehold, the person has the right to use the property, but they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their home.\n\nLeaseholders typically complain about being over-charged by managing agents for repairs to common areas, such as roofs, or about punitive ground rents.\n\nIt can also be expensive to extend a lease, and in some cases leases have been sold on at inflated prices.\n\nFour million people in England own leasehold properties.\n\nThe Law Commission says commonhold gives ownership and control of the block to flat owners, as it is managed by a company made up of the owners. Properties are owned forever under the system.\n\nHowever, since the Commonhold Act came into force in 2004, only 20 commonhold developments have been created - including just one in London, and one in Manchester.\n\nThe Law Commission says low take-up has been attributed to a range of reasons, including shortcomings in the law governing commonhold; mortgage lenders' unwillingness to lend on such properties; a lack of awareness of the system; and existing financial incentives for developers to use leasehold.\n\nIt has launched a consultation on the issue, to help develop recommendations for the government.\n\nWhat is Commonhold?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nCommonhold allows residents to own their flats or houses outright, similar to freehold\n\nCommonholders have no landlord\n\nThere are no leases to expire\n\nResidents are members of the management company, allowing them to vote on matters to do with upkeep\n\nProperties can be sold on as commonhold, unless 80% of owners agree to go to leasehold\n\nThe Law Commission said reforms would:\n\nAllow a commonhold development to include both residential units, as well as commercial units such as restaurants and shops\n\nMake it easier to convert from leasehold to commonhold\n\nIncrease lender confidence in commonhold and so increase the choice of mortgage lenders available\n\nReplace service charges set by a landlord with commonhold contributions which have to be approved by a majority of those paying them\n\nProfessor Nick Hopkins, from the Law Commission, said commonhold provided a \"once in a generation opportunity to rethink how we own property\".\n\n\"It involves a culture change, moving away from an 'us and them' mindset,\" he said.\n\nThe government has already promised to ban compulsory leasehold agreements on new-build properties.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"The government supports the use of commonhold and is committed to exploring the benefits of all types of tenure to offer greater choice for homeowners.\n\n\"We welcome the work that the Law Commission is undertaking on commonhold and want to hear views from as many people as possible.\"\n\nWhat is a leasehold?\n\nSomeone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder.\n\nMost houses are freehold but some might be leasehold - usually through shared-ownership schemes.\n\nWith a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property.\n\nBut they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes.\n\nLeaseholders have to pay their freeholders ground rent plus other fees in order to make changes to their homes.\n\nNon-payment of fees means a landlord can seek to forfeit the lease at any point.\n\nWhen the lease ends, the property returns to the freeholder unless the person can extend the lease.\n\nSome leaseholders wish to buy their freeholds to save themselves these costs.\n\nSource: The Money Advice Service/Leasehold Knowledge Partnership"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Raheem Sterling: Chelsea fans banned for alleged abuse of Manchester City forward", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46514300", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:34", "body_paragraphs": "Sterling was allegedly racially abused during Manchester City's defeat at Chelsea\n\nChelsea have suspended four people from attending matches while an investigation into the alleged racial abuse of Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling takes place.\n\nThe incident involving the 24-year-old occurred during City's 2-0 loss at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.\n\nChelsea are \"fully supporting\" an ongoing police investigation.\n\nA club statement said evidence of racist behaviour will result in \"severe sanctions, including bans\".\n\n\"Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour abhorrent,\" the statement continued, adding that the club \"will also fully support any criminal prosecutions\".\n\nManchester City welcomed Chelsea's decision to issue suspensions.\n\nA club statement said: \"The club and Raheem are fully engaged with Chelsea FC and the investigating authorities as they continue to examine the events in question.\n\n\"Manchester City and Raheem are committed to working with all relevant parties and organisations to support the objective of eradicating racism from the game.\"\n\nSocial media users posted a video of an incident during which Sterling was shouted at as he collected the ball from behind the goal.\n\nSterling said he \"had to laugh\" when he heard the remarks because he expects \"no better\".\n\nA subsequent Instagram post from the England international saw him question the way the media portrays black players and has prompted debate between stakeholders in the game.\n\nThe Professional Footballers' Association has said negative press coverage of Sterling \"emboldens racist rhetoric\", adding the former Liverpool player is \"often singled out\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Theresa May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46509288", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:35", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May announces Tuesday's planned Brexit deal will not go ahead: \"I've listened very carefully\"\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has called off Tuesday's crucial vote on her Brexit deal so she can go back to Brussels and ask for changes to it.\n\nAs it stands the deal \"would be rejected by a significant margin\" if MPs voted on it, she admitted.\n\nBut she said she was confident of getting \"reassurances\" from the EU on the Northern Ireland border plan.\n\nMPs reacted angrily to her announcement with Labour's Jeremy Corbyn saying she had \"lost control of events\".\n\nAnd European Council President Donald Tusk insisted the remaining 27 EU countries would not \"renegotiate the deal\", including the controversial Northern Irish backstop.\n\nHowever, he said EU leaders would be willing to \"discuss how to facilitate UK ratification\" of the withdrawal agreement at Thursday's summit in Brussels.\n\nThe prime minister's U-turn came after she and senior ministers had spent days insisting the vote would go ahead, despite the scale of opposition from MPs being obvious.\n\nIn other Brexit developments\n\nAny indication of a new timeline for vote?\n\nTheresa May refused to say when the Commons vote on her deal would now be held -

Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP\n\nBoth the UK government and the EU had been against it going to the ECJ.\n\nThe EU warned that it would set a dangerous precedent by encouraging other countries to announce they were leaving in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal.\n\nThe UK government's lawyers also argued that the case was purely hypothetical as \"the UK does not intend to revoke its notification\" and those politicians behind it wanted to use the case as \"political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament\".\n\nWhat does the ruling say?\n\nThe ECJ ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke its withdrawal from the EU, broadly following the non-binding opinion given last week by a senior ECJ official - the advocate general.\n\nThe statement from the court said the ability for a member state to change its mind after telling the EU it wanted to leave would last as long as a withdrawal agreement had not been entered into, or for the two-year period after it had notified the bloc it was leaving.\n\nIf that two-year period gets extended, then a member state could change its mind during that extra time too.\n\nThe court said the UK would be able to stay on the same terms it has now, so it would not be forced to join the euro or the Schengen area - where there are no passport controls between countries.\n\nBut the decision to stay must \"follow a democratic process\".\n\nThe member state would then have to write to the EU to notify them of the \"unequivocal and unconditional\" decision.\n\nThe ECJ said it made the ruling to \"clarify the options open to MPs\" ahead of voting on Mrs May's deal.\n\nHow have campaigners reacted?\n\nThe politicians involved hope the victory will increase the chances of Brexit being called off completely, potentially through another referendum.\n\nScottish Green MSP Ross Greer - one of the politicians who launched the case - said: \"This is a massive moment at the start of a vital week, pointing to a clear way out of the Brexit mess.\"\n\nAnd the SNP's Alyn Smith, who was also involved in the case, said: \"A bright light has switched on above an exit sign.\"\n\nJolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project which took the case to the court, said that the ruling was \"arguably the most important case in modern domestic legal history\".\n\n\"It is up to MPs to remember what they came into politics for and find the moral courage to put the country's interests before private ambition,\" he added.\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who backed Remain - said the ruling meant it was \"now open to the House of Commons\" to extend Article 50 to allow time for another vote.\n\nAnd Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake tweeted that it was the \"best news possible\" and said it was now \"full steam ahead for a People's Vote\".\n\nWhat about their critics?\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexiteer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme those calling for a second vote were \"people who never accepted that first vote, who didn't accept that democratic mandate and who want to overturn it\".\n\n\"We don't want to stay in the EU. We voted very clearly, 17.4 million people sent a clear message that we want to leave the European Union, and that means also leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,\" he added.\n\n\"So, this case is all very well, but it doesn't alter the referendum vote or the clear intention of the government to make sure that we leave on 29 March.\"\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC people would be \"shocked and very angry\" if any government delayed leaving the EU and it was \"certainly not the intention of the government\".\n\nBrexiteer Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg hailed the decision as the right one, but said it would not affect Tuesday's vote without a U-turn from government.\n\n\"I think this government would find it very difficult to remain the government if it went away from what it said in its manifesto and the referendum result,\" he told LBC.\n\nWhat does the EU say?\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Commission said it would \"take note\" of the judgement, but there was an \"agreement on the table\".\n\n\"As President [Jean-Claude] Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate,\" he said.\n\n\"Our position has therefore not changed and as far as we are concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on the 29 March 2019.\"\n\nHow does the ruling affect the meaningful vote?\n\nBBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the ruling made staying in the EU \"a real, viable option\" and that may \"sway a few MPs\" in the way they vote.\n\nBut he said \"a lot would have to change in British politics\" to see the UK remain in the EU, with Mrs May and the government having to change its mind to make it a \"political reality\"."},

\"respectful and mature\" to allow MPs to express a view, he said.\n\nBut the BBC's Vicki Young said ministers intended to defy Mr Bercow by not permitting a vote.\n\nThis will be confirmed later this

leader Andrea Leadsom defended the move as a \"common procedure\", arguing it \"in line with normal convention that government decides the order of business\".\n\nIn her statement, the prime minister told MPs that the final vote on the deal she had negotiated with the EU would be \"deferred\" to an unspecified date so she could resume talks with EU leaders.\n\nShe acknowledged that she would have been likely to lose Tuesday's vote by a significant margin.\n\nWhile she believed a majority of MPs backed the broad terms of the deal, she said she had listened to MPs' concerns over the Northern Ireland border backstop plan and said she would seek \"further reassurances\".\n\nMPs were due to vote on Tuesday whether to accept or reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and future relations with the EU, after five days of debate.\n\n'Late stage'\n\nAfter Mrs May's announcement, Mr Bercow said many MPs had told him \"forcefully\" that they were dismayed by the decision to pull

it would be preferable to give MPs their say before doing so.\n\n\"Halting the debate after no fewer than 164 colleagues have taken the trouble to contribute will be thought by many members of this House to be deeply discourteous,\" he said.\n\n\"I politely suggest that in any courteous, respectful and mature environment, allowing the house to have a say would be the right and, dare I say it, the obvious, course to take.\"\n\nVote deadline?\n\nA succession of Labour MPs criticised the prime minister for pulling the vote, suggesting her actions were not motivated by the national interest but a desperate move to placate Brexiteers in her own party.\n\nDennis Skinner suggested Mrs May was \"frit\" while Mr Bradshaw said if she did not have the courage to put her deal to MPs, the PM should give the public its say.\n\nAnd Conservative former education secretary Justine Greening sought assurances that the final vote would not be left until 28 March 2019, the day before the UK is to due to leave the EU.\n\nShe said the existing obligation on ministers to make a statement to MPs by 21 January setting out their course of action if there is no deal or the deal is rejected, had been

largest providers of public services has confirmed that it is seeking a rescue deal as it struggles with \u00a3500m of debt.\n\nInterserve, which works in prisons, schools, hospitals and on the roads, said it was \"making good progress\" on a long-term recovery plan.\n\nIt said details of the plan, which it expected to announce early next year, were yet to be finalised,\n\nHowever, it was likely that it would involve issuing new shares.\n\nWorkers at the Foreign Office and the NHS are among Interserve's tens of thousands of UK employees.\n\nThe government has said it supports the company's long-term recovery plan.\n\nOn Saturday, the Financial Times reported that the company was looking for a deal to refinance its debt which would mean lenders taking a significant loss, while public shareholders would be \"virtually wiped out\".\n\nInterserve's statement, issued on Sunday, said it was in talks about a \"deleveraging plan\", which it said would deliver \"a strong balance

ensure the company's survival.\n\nLenders described talks around the company's future as \"extremely fluid\".\n\nThey recognised inevitable comparisons to the situation that engulfed Carillion, but insist the company's management still has lenders' support.\n\nThe BBC also understands Interserve is expected to announce imminently it has secured new public service contracts.\n\nThe Labour party leadership - ideologically opposed to the role of private companies in the provision of public services - has insisted that no new government contracts should be awarded to the company while it is in a parlous financial position.\n\nThat position is widely considered within industry to be detrimental to the future of a company that employs 75,000 worldwide, 45.000 in the UK.\n\nRead more from Simon here\n\n\"Although the form of the deleveraging plan remains to be finalised, it is likely to involve the conversion of a substantial proportion of the group's external borrowings into new equity, an element of which may be sold to existing shareholders and potentially other investors,\" the firm said.\n\n\"If implemented in this form, the deleveraging plan could result in material dilution for current Interserve shareholders.\"\n\nInterserve's share price dropped to a 30-year low last month.\n\nDespite lucrative contracts in the Middle East and its wide range of work in the UK, the company has continued to lose money since March, when it agreed an earlier rescue deal.\n\nIts troubles have been blamed on cancellations and delays in its construction contracts as well as struggling waste-to-energy projects in Derby and Glasgow.\n\nInterserve claims its prospects are improving, and says it will increase profits this year.\n\nWhat does Interserve do?\n\nFrom its origins in dredging and construction, the company has diversified into wide range of services, such as health care and catering, for clients in government and industry.\n\nAt King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a \u00a335m contract for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance.\n\nIts infrastructure projects include improving the M5 Junction 6 near Bristol, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water.\n\nBut Interserve is also the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 \"medium-low risk offenders\" for the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIn a statement, Interserve said: \"The fundamentals of the business are strong and the board is focused on ensuring Interserve has the right financial structure to support its future success.\"\n\nThe company said its options included bringing \"new capital into the business and progressing the disposal of non-core businesses \".\n\nInterserve's difficulties follow the collapse of Carillion in January 2018, which put thousands of jobs at risk and cost taxpayers \u00a3148m.\n\nFollowing that, the government launched a pilot of \"living wills\" for contractors, so that critical services can be taken over in the event of a crisis. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part.\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve, and have regular discussions with the company's management.

This indicated that it had crossed the \"heliopause\" - the term for the outer edge of the Sun's protective bubble of particles and magnetic field.\n\nAnd while its twin craft beat it to this boundary, the US space agency says that Voyager 2 has a working instrument aboard that will provide \"first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway into interstellar space\".\n\nThe probe's present location is some 18 billion km (11 billion miles) from Earth.

Voyager 1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager 2.\n\nThe pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989.\n\nThey were then steered towards deep space. It is expected that their plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their 20W transmitters will die.\n\nThe Voyager project manager, Suzanne Dodd told BBC News that she would like to see them both keep going until 2027.\n\n\"It would be super-exciting to have a 50-year mission still operating,\" she added, describing the probes as \"pioneers\" of interstellar space.\n\n\"Every so often they phone home and say - 'I'm still going.

For Spiti Lahaul, it is 34% - equivalent to about -5m/year per decade. These are glaciers that would normally move at tens of metres per year.\n\nImage copyright F.PAUL/NASA/USGS Image caption Landsat has built multi-decade records of glacier behaviour in Asia\n\nWhat was the key finding?\n\nPerhaps the major revelation is that the reduction in velocity is strongly correlated with thinning. Nyainq\u00eantanglha's glaciers have been thinning on average by about 60cm a year; Spiti Lahaul's glaciers are losing thickness at a rate of roughly 40cm a year.\n\n\"The reason a glacier flows is because of gravity,\" explained Dr Dehecq. \"Under its weight, the glacier slides across its bed and deforms, but as it thins it finds it more difficult to slide and deform; it's kind of intuitive.\n\n\"But until now there had been some debate as to whether other factors were influencing speed, such as the lubrication of the bed as a result of increased meltwater getting under the glacier. Well, we show thinning is actually the dominant factor,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAre some glaciers getting faster?\n\nThe slowdown trend is strongest in the south and southeast of High Mountain Asia; it is less pronounced in the West.\n\nRegions like the Karakorum in Pakistan, and Kunlun just across the border in Tibet/China, have actually shown a slight thickening over time and a marginal speed-up as a consequence.\n\n\"That's the influence of different climatic conditions,\" said co-author Dr Noel Gourmelen from Edinburgh University, UK. \"Precipitation in the East is affected by the Asian monsoon and in the West and North-West, it is delivered by westerlies; although it's not exactly clear why the Karakorum has been gaining mass.\"\n\nImage copyright shylendrahoode Image caption Galcier meltwaters ensure south Asia has a consistent supply of water, even in drought\n\nWhy is this research important?\n\nThe meltwater that flows from the 90,000 glaciers in High Mountain Asia is critical to the lives and livelihoods of the people downstream. But the significance goes much wider, because the snow and ice stored \"in the freezer\" at high altitude would otherwise push up global sea levels if it all melted and ran into the ocean. That is why scientists need to understand how the glaciers will respond in an ever-warming world.\n\nThis study, which has also been published in the journal Nature Geoscience, has described an important dynamic that will moderate how much ice is transported down mountains to the elevations where it can melt.\n\nComputer models that try to project the future resilience of the glaciers in what they call Earth's \"third pole\" must now take account of this behaviour.\n\nDr Hamish Pritchard from the British Antarctic Survey also studies these glaciers. He said their contribution to rivers across the region was small in the average year, but significantly heightened during years of drought.\n\n\"My research shows that when the summer rains fail, glacier melt comes to dominate water inputs to many catchments in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Without this water supply more crops would fail, substantially less hydropower would be generated and more people would be forced to migrate,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"These rivers that flow down from the mountains pass through many communities and across national borders, so when supplies are low, tensions between neighbouring communities and countries would likely increase.\n\n\"Studies show that this tension could lead to conflict, with implications far beyond South and Central Asia.\n\n\"The key role of these glaciers then is as a buffer against the worst effects of drought, and so the loss of glacier ice can be seen as a threat to the future stability of the region.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Amount of deep life on Earth quantified", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46502570", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bob Hazen: \"It opens the window to lifeforms we may not even be able to imagine\"\n\nScientists have estimated the total amount of life on Earth that exists below ground - and it is vast.\n\nYou would need a microscope to see this subterranean biosphere, however.\n\nIt is made up mostly of microbes, such as bacteria and their evolutionary cousins, the archaea.\n\nNonetheless, it represents a lot of carbon - about 15 to 23 billion tonnes of it.

The minerals in the rocks around them are their larder.\n\nThe role all these organisms play in shifting carbon about the Earth is profound, according to the DCO's executive director, Bob Hazen.\n\n\"You cannot understand carbon on Earth without understanding the diversity and influence of life. Cells turn over carbon - they take carbon in, they breathe it out. They do amazing things to transform their local environments,\" he explained.\n\n\"Although the total amount of carbon in other sources is much, much larger than in life, life has a disproportionate affect on Earth's carbon cycle.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL-CALTECH/SSI Image caption Somewhere out there? Could other planets and moons have subterranean ecosystems?\n\nWhat are the implications of this research?\n\nAnother aspect of the research is what is says about the absolute limits of life on Earth in terms of temperature, pressure, and the availability of energy.\n\n\"The current known upper-limit for life is 122 degrees Celsius, which happens to be the temperature of sterilisation equipment we typically use in labs,\" said Dr Lloyd.\n\n\"But there's no-one I know who thinks that's the theoretical limit. For example, we know some of the problems associated with high temperatures, such as the disordering of lipids and membranes, is at least partially compensated by higher pressures. Which means it's possible we could find even higher temperature organisms the deeper we go down.\"\n\nAnd this has clear implications for the possibility that life exists somewhere else in the Solar System, adds Prof Colwell.\n\n\"I think it's probably reasonable to assume that the subsurface of other planets and their moons are habitable, especially since we've seen here on Earth that organisms can function far away from sunlight using the energy provided directly from the rocks deep underground,\" he told BBC News.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change and the UK: The good and bad", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46509495", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nWith UN climate talks under way in Poland, pressure is on for nations to cut carbon emissions fast. The UK says it\u2019s a leader in climate change \u2013 but is it?\n\nHere's a list of the good and bad in terms of the UK's climate change record - depending on your point of view.\n\nFive good things (from a government perspective)\n\nThe British government claims to be a leader in cutting carbon emissions - here are five achievements of present and past administrations.\n\nClimate change act\n\nTen years ago, the UK passed the Climate Change Act, which binds ministers to cutting at least 80% of emissions by 2050. It has inspired other governments from around the world by proving we can have strong economic growth whilst cutting emissions. Scientists say that targets must now be tougher.\n\nClimate change committee\n\nMinisters created an independent Climate Change Committee to advise on the cheapest and most effective ways of cutting carbon emissions. The government has exceeded its short-term targets, but it\u2019s slipping away from medium-term goals \u2013 and advisers say it\u2019ll face a huge challenge if it raises ambition to tackle 100% of emissions by 2050.\n\nThe science\n\nThe UK consistently over-achieves on climate science. Despite spending cuts, Britain continues to supply a disproportionate number of lead scientists for influential UN reports warning of the urgency of climate change.\n\nThe City\n\nThe Bank of England governor Mark Carney took a global stand by warning firms that fossil fuel assets may lose value as we tackle climate change. Some financial institutions have started to take notice, but environmentalists complain that many are pursuing business as usual.\n\nAuctioning subsidies\n\nIt sounds obscure \u2013 but the UK introduced a system in which wind power firms wanting financial support had to bid at auction. Alongside earlier support, and technology innovation, this auction process has radically forced down the price of offshore wind.\n\nFive bad things (from an environmentalist perspective)\n\nEnvironmentalists accept that the UK has taken a leadership role in the past, but they argue that their ambitions are too low. Many campaigners also say that ministers have made too many policy U-turns. Here are five of their complaints.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOnshore wind\n\nOnshore wind is our cheapest clean energy source and government surveys show it\u2019s liked by most people. In 2015, ministers decided to virtually block new onshore wind power in the UK after back-bench MPs said it was unpopular. Ministers said local people should have a veto over wind turbines.\n\nRoads\n\nMinisters urge people to cycle to improve health and reduce pollution \u2013 yet local councils can\u2019t afford to fill potholes. Meanwhile, \u00a330bn has being spent on new trunk roads. The government is accused of favouring big infrastructure over small with policies such as an expansion of aviation. Ministers say roads and runways are needed to meet future demand.\n\nRail\n\nLocal commuter rail services get people out of cars but they are starved on funding. Meanwhile, countless billions are being spent on high speed long distance rail. Ministers say rail capacity must be increased.\n\nSolar\n\nAfter one of David Cameron\u2019s aides was said to have promised to \u201cget rid of the green crap\u201d, the government cut support for solar energy overnight. It infuriated investors and halved the industry. Ministers said solar should stand on its own feet.\n\nHomes\n\nClimate change can\u2019t be tackled unless homes stay warm better. But after the government cut grants, insulation numbers dropped by 90%. Ministers also killed a plan at the last minute for zero-carbon homes. They said it would raise the cost of housing.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change say policies needing immediate action are: home insulation and low-carbon heating low-cost renewables (including onshore wind), energy efficiency and electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition, the government needs to also kick-start new industries in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen. In the longer-term, the biggest challenges will be reducing emissions from aviation, industry, and agricultural sectors.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter.\n\nUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018\n\nThe summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Trump coal event overshadowed at COP24", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46502210", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nWhite House representatives arrive at climate talks in Poland on Monday to promote coal and other fossil fuels.\n\nIt's expected that President Donald Trump's energy adviser, Wells Griffith, will take part in the COP24 event.\n\nThe controversial meeting occurs as investors managing $32tn (\u00a325tn) in assets call for an end to coal as a source of energy.\n\nMeanwhile, ministers from around 130 countries arrive here to try and steer the talks to a successful conclusion.\n\nJust as at last year's gathering in Bonn, the Trump White House is keen to show strong support for fossil fuels.\n\nAccording to a statement from the US State Department, the event will \"showcase ways to use fossil fuels as cleanly and efficiently as possible, as well as the use of emission-free nuclear energy\".\n\nLast year's event was disrupted by singing protesters keen to point out that the pro-coal and gas lobby were not welcome at the UN event.\n\nThis year's meeting has environmentalists questioning its relevance.\n\n\"The event is going to further undermine the credibility of the US as a party in these talks,\" said Lou Leonard with WWF.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Donald Trump has long spoken of his devotion to coal\n\n\"It is going to have virtually no impact on the actual talks - it's a sideshow, it's a side event, its not something related to what the parties are negotiating right now.\"\n\nThe White House-endorsed event does indeed seem to be out of step with the wider conference, where green campaigners are likely be cheered by the news that 415 investors with around $32tn of assets under management are calling for greater action on climate change and an end to coal as a source of energy.\n\nReleased here in Katowice, the global investor statement is said to be the largest intervention by investors on the issue of rising temperatures, and represents some of the world's biggest funds including Schroders plc, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Aberdeen Standard Investments and UBS Asset Management.\n\n\"Despite the misguided policies of the Trump administration, global efforts to address the very real threat climate risk presents to the economy, financial markets and investment returns are ongoing,\" said Thomas P.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "FBI Charge 2 in Ohio Accused of Plotting Separate Attacks", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-charge-2-in-ohio-accused-of-plotting-separate-attacks/4694406.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Federal authorities say they've charged two people in Ohio involved in planning separate attacks, including one who wanted to carry out a shooting at a synagogue.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Justice said Monday that the attacks were in the planning stages and that there was no immediate threat to the public.\n\n\n\nBut they say both people who are from the Toledo area had identified specific places they wanted to target.\n\n\n\nThe FBI says a suburban Toledo man arrested Friday wanted to carry out an attack on behalf of ISIS and began focusing on a synagogue and talked of killing many people, including a rabbi.\n\n\n\nFederal authorities say the other arrest involved a woman who wanted to shoot up a bar and also blow up a pipeline."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Supreme Court Won't Hear States' Planned Parenthood Appeal", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-won-t-hear-states-planned-parenthood-appeal-/4694392.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "The Supreme Court on Monday avoided a high-profile case by rejecting appeals from Kansas and Louisiana in their effort to strip Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood, over the dissenting votes of three justices.\n\nThe court's order reflected a split among its conservative justices and an accusation from Justice Clarence Thomas that his colleagues seemed to be ducking the case for political reasons. New Justice Brett Kavanaugh was among the justices who opted not to hear the case.\n\nThe two states were appealing lower court rulings that had blocked them from withholding money that is used for health services for low-income women. The money is not used for abortions. Abortion opponents have said Planned Parenthood should not receive any government money because of heavily edited videos that claimed to show the nation's largest abortion provider profiting from sales of fetal tissue for medical research.\n\nInvestigations sparked by the videos in several states didn't result in criminal charges.\n\nThe dispute at the high court has nothing to do with abortion, as Thomas pointed out in a dissent that was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.\n\nKavanaugh's decision not to join the three justices was his first discernible vote on the court. Had he or Chief Justice John Roberts voted to hear the case, there would have been the four votes necessary to set the case for arguments.\n\nThe issue is who has the right to challenge a state's Medicaid funding decisions, private individuals or only the federal government. The states say that the Medicaid program, a joint venture of federal and state governments to provide health care to poorer Americans, makes clear that only the Secretary of Health and Human Services can intervene, by withholding money from a state.\n\nMost lower federal courts have found that private parties can challenge Medicaid funding decisions in court, although the federal appeals court in St. Louis rejected a similar court challenge and allowed Arkansas to end its contract with Planned Parenthood. A split among federal appeals courts is often a reason for the Supreme Court to step in.\n\n\"So what explains the court's refusal to do its job here? I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named `Planned Parenthood.' That makes the Court's decision particularly troubling, as the question presented has nothing to do with abortion,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nThe dispute over funding for Planned Parenthood stemmed from the July 2015 release by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress of a series of edited videos purportedly depicting Planned Parenthood of America executives talking about the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood has said it did not seek any payments beyond legally permitted reimbursement of costs.\n\nCatherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of the anti-abortion Americans United for Life, said the court should have heard the case.\n\n\"But the good news is that there are other similar cases pending in lower courts, which may give the Supreme Court another opportunity to decide this important issue. In the meantime, AUL will continue to fight to protect states from being forced to use their limited public funds to subsidize abortion businesses,\" Foster said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen praised the decision to leave the lower court rulings in place.\n\n\"As a doctor, I have seen what's at stake when people cannot access the care they need, and when politics gets in the way of people making their own health care choices. We won't stop fighting for every patient who relies on Planned Parenthood for life-saving, life-changing care,\" Wen said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "The Power of Political Cartoons", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/the-power-of-political-cartoons-/4694285.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Editorial cartoons -- also known as political cartoons -- have been around as long as there's been political discourse and dissent.

Yet the layoffs and plant closings could imperil GM's push to keep the incentive. It helps make plug-ins such as the $36,000 Chevy Bolt more affordable at a time when competition from other electric vehicle makers is heating up.\n\nGM faces opposition from President Donald Trump and other Republicans who consider the credit a waste of taxpayer money and want it eliminated. Trump, who has pledged a manufacturing rebirth in the Midwest, reacted angrily to GM's \u201ctransformation \u201c announcement late last month, declaring that his administration was \u201clooking at cutting all GM subsidies, including for electric cars.\u201d\n\nThe company already is on the verge of being phased out of the tax credit program unless Congress changes a law that caps the break at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. Without the incentive, GM may be forced to cut the price of its electric cars to keep prospective customers from taking their business elsewhere, according to automotive industry experts.\n\nAs evidence of the credit's importance to GM's future, the automaker has expanded its lobbying footprint in Washington and even joined forces with two rivals, Tesla and Nissan, to call for 200,000-vehicle limit to be scrapped.\n\nStanding in the way of that goal is Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Barrasso introduced legislation in October to abolish the tax credit, a move he said would save about $20 billion over the next 10 years. He has argued the market for electric vehicles is already established and \u201cno longer needs the crutch of government assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of the subsidies had to do with trying to make sure that electric vehicles would be a viable technology,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cWell, that's clearly there.\u201d\n\nThe tax credit came up briefly during a private meeting on Wednesday between Ohio's senators, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown, and GM chief executive Mary Barra, according to a congressional aide familiar with the conversation. As part of the restructuring, GM said it will stop making the Chevy Cruze at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant by March and is considering closing the plant for good.\n\nPortman told Barra that it's difficult to help with priorities such as the electric vehicle credit when GM is moving production out of Ohio, according to the aide, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nOne of the lobbyists working to salvage the credit for GM is Kent Hance, a former chancellor of Texas Tech University who is well connected in GOP circles, according to his online profile. Hance lists his role as a fundraiser for the campaigns of outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and others. He has known Rick Perry, the energy secretary and former Texas governor, for nearly 30 years.\n\nGM in early August named a former Trump White House official, Everett Eissenstat, its senior vice president for global public policy, a post that oversees the company's lobbying operations. Eissenstat, however, is not registered as a lobbyist, according to disclosure records filed with Congress. Before coming to GM, he was Trump's deputy assistant for international economic affairs.\n\nUnder federal law, the $7,500 credit for buyers begins to phase out after a manufacturer has sold 200,000 qualifying electric vehicles. GM has estimated it will hit that threshold by the end of December, just as the Bolt will be facing new and potentially stiff competition.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, a senior analyst at Navigant Research, said Hyundai and Kia each will be selling compact SUVs in the U.S. beginning early next year that can travel 240 miles on a single battery charge, about the same as the Bolt. Ford will be launching a number of new plug-in hybrid models in 2019, including the Lincoln Aviator, Explorer and Escape.\n\n\u201cWith the intensifying market shift away from cars to utility vehicles all of these are expected to be more popular than the Bolt,\u201d Abuelsamid said. To remain competitive against the new entries, \u201cGM will likely have to cut the (retail price) of the Bolt as well as any additional EVs they launch next year by the corresponding reduction in the tax credits,\u201d he said.\n\nKarl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, said the credit is \u201chugely important\u201d to electric vehicle manufacturers. Lowering the up-front cost of the vehicle typically plays a significant role in sales, he said, citing surveys that show more consumers would buy electric vehicles if the cars were affordably priced.\n\nGM joined forces with Tesla and Nissan as well as several consumer and environmental groups to broaden its lobbying push even further. The EV Drive Coalition, which was launched in November, urged lawmakers in an open letter last week to put a provision in the must-pass government spending bill that does away with the 200,000-car limit.\n\n\u201cEliminating the per-manufacturer cap will level the playing field for all EV manufacturers and spur innovation among domestic manufacturers, ensuring America's leadership in the hyper-competitive, global auto market,\u201d the coalition said.\n\nTesla hit its 200,000 mark in July and Nissan has sold nearly 128,000 electric vehicles, according to data compiled by the car shopping site Edmunds.com. Other automakers are a long way from the ceiling: Hyundai, for example, has sold 15,550 plug-in vehicles, the numbers show, while Toyota is around 94,000 in electric vehicle sales.\n\nJeannine Ginivan, a GM spokeswoman, said the tax credit should be modified but declined to say whether the automaker backs a specific piece of legislation that would remove the cap.\n\n\u201cWe believe an important part of reaching a zero emissions future and establishing the U.S. as the leader in electrification is to continue to provide a federal tax credit to help make electric vehicles more affordable for all customers,\u201d Ginivan said in an email.\n\nIn addition to GM's in-house lobbyists, four lobbyists from Hance Scarborough, the Austin, Texas-based firm that Hance founded in 1994, are working on GM's behalf, including Hance, according to disclosure records.\n\nGM also contracted with two other lobbying firms earlier this year to focus on electric and automated vehicle issues: the Polaris-Hutton Group and the DS2 Group. A fourth firm, the S-3 Group, was hired by GM in 2014 and earlier this year added the tax credit to its portfolio of lobbying issues."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Downplays Payments to Women Who Alleged Affairs With Him", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-downplays-payments-to-women-who-alleged-affairs-with-him/4694198.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump sought Monday to diminish allegations he directed his lawyer to criminally violate campaign finance laws by making $280,000 in payments to two women to remain silent before the 2016 election about alleged affairs with him.\n\nTrump said on Twitter the payments made by his former attorney, Michael Cohen, were \"a simple private transaction,\" and that opposition Democrats and federal prosecutors \"wrongly call it a campaign contribution, which it was not.\"\n\nThe U.S. leader said that \u201c...even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE,\" comparing it to campaign finance violations committed in 2008 by his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama.

Cohen is being sentenced Wednesday for making the payments, along with several other criminal offenses, and faces several years in prison.\n\nTrump, as he often does, derided special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing 19-month investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to help him win the election and whether, as president, Trump obstructed justice by trying to thwart the probe.\n\nQuoting a Fox News report, Trump said, \"Democrats can\u2019t find a Smocking (sic) Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia...

Nadler said, however, \"There's nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the president from being indicted. Nobody should be above the law.\"\n\nDemocratic Congressman Adam Schiff, set to assume control of the House Intelligence Committee next month, told CBS News on Sunday, \"My takeaway is there's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.\"\n\nTrump has called for the end to the Mueller probe, but a Republican lawmaker, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, told ABC News, \"I've always supported the Mueller investigation and continue to do so because I think it's in the best interest of everyone involved, including, by the way, the president.\"\n\nAside from Cohen, Mueller so far has secured guilty pleas or won convictions of Trump's first national security adviser, his former campaign manager, his former deputy campaign manager, a foreign policy adviser and other lesser figures.\n\nBlaming Comey\n\nOn Sunday, Trump assailed former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey, whom Trump fired while he was heading the Russia investigation before Mueller was named to lead the probe. Comey testified to a House panel on Friday about his role in 2016 election-related investigations of Trump's campaign and that of his challenger, Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state.\n\n\"On 245 occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t recall, or couldn\u2019t remember things when asked,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\n\"Leakin\u2019 James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day. His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!\"\n\nLate Sunday, Comey said Americans \"should use every breath we have to make sure\" Trump is defeated in 2020 when he is running for re-election to a second term."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "The Power of Political Cartoons", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/the-power-of-political-cartoons-/4694285.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Editorial cartoons -- also known as political cartoons -- have been around as long as there's been political discourse and dissent.

While Mother brings the turkey to the table, family members are shown immersed in their mobile phones instead of paying attention to this time-honored ritual.\n\nHe was inspired by a popular painting by American artist Norman Rockwell who painted idyllic scenes reflecting American culture.\n\nWhile Wuerker created the cartoon for an American audience, its message is universal; a striking example of how technology is disrupting such simple rituals as meal time.\n\nA variety of styles\n\nWuerker's cartoons are very ornate and detailed and painted in a variety of colors. But he\u2019s a bit envious of other cartoonists he says, who can express themselves with a simple line drawing. They can \u201cmake the statement with very little drawing and it can be just as effective, if not maybe more effective,\u201d he says.\n\nThe format of cartoons has evolved, he says.\n\n\u201cWhen I started 40 years ago doing cartoons, an editorial cartoon was a black-and-white single-panel cartoon in a newspaper. And now cartoons can be color, they can be animated, they can be graphic novels that are political.\u201d\n\nLike the 2018 Pulitzer Prize-winning work by journalist Jake Halpern and illustrator Michael Sloan currently on display at the Newseum in Washington.\n\n\u201cThey did something quite extraordinary,\u201d says Patty Rhule, Vice President of Exhibits at the Newseum. \u201cThey did a 20-part series in the New York Times following the story of two Syrian immigrants who fled the war in Syria to come to this country and start a new life with their families.\u201d\n\nIt marked the newspaper's first Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning.\n\nRhule says editorial cartoons \u201cbring faces and art to current events and tell stories in a way that journalists who are reporting strict facts can\u2019t always do,\u201d adding that the graphic novel format the two journalists used \u201ctakes cartooning to a whole new level; they add a note of commentary on what is happening in the world.\u201d\n\nEditorial cartoons have always been an important part of American culture, she adds.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of this country, editorial cartoons have been framing issues and framing debate -- from Ben Franklin's Live Free or Die [Join, or Die], the segmented snake that rallied the 13 colonies together. So it's always been a part of this country and the world's way of freely expressing ideas and debate, and so I hope they never go away.\u201d\n\nCartoon backlash\n\nBut free expression sometimes comes at a heavy price.\n\nIn 2015, Islamic terrorists attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine, after it published unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Twelve people were killed in the attack, including several prominent cartoonists.\n\n\u201cAnd within their [Islamic] culture they are certainly entitled to be offended, but they\u2019re not entitled to decide that they're going to go to Paris and kill the people who created that cartoon that was really intended for a French audience,\u201d Wuerker says.\n\nHe has great respect, he says, for cartoonists who keep working despite the dangers.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my career I\u2019ve gotten to know a lot of cartoonists from different parts of the world, and the ones that really impress me are the ones that keep drawing despite having to live with constant threats all the time.\u201d\n\n\"Many cartoonists have had to flee their country because they were brave enough to take on regimes or political figures that don't understand that a free press is a salutary thing,\" he adds.\n\nHe hopes that in these troubled times, people will appreciate cartoons for what they are.\n\n\u201cThe times have become so vitriolic and people are so quick to anger. I think the good kind of political cartooning is something that slips in a really good political point with a certain amount of good humor and wit that people will process and hopefully won\u2019t make them angry but will make them think.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Downplays Payments to Women Who Alleged Affairs With Him", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-downplays-payments-to-women-who-alleged-affairs-with-him/4694198.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump sought Monday to diminish allegations he directed his lawyer to criminally violate campaign finance laws by making $280,000 in payments to two women to remain silent before the 2016 election about alleged affairs with him.\n\nTrump said on Twitter the payments made by his former attorney, Michael Cohen, were \"a simple private transaction,\" and that opposition Democrats and federal prosecutors \"wrongly call it a campaign contribution, which it was not.\"\n\nThe U.S. leader said that \u201c...even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE,\" comparing it to campaign finance violations committed in 2008 by his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama. But Trump said the payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal were \"done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer\u2019s liability if he made a mistake, not me.\"\n\nHe said, \"Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nTrump's comments on Cohen came after federal prosecutors said Friday the Trump attorney, \"in coordination with and at the direction\" of then-candidate Trump, made the hush money payments shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen is being sentenced Wednesday for making the payments, along with several other criminal offenses, and faces several years in prison.\n\nTrump, as he often does, derided special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing 19-month investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to help him win the election and whether, as president, Trump obstructed justice by trying to thwart the probe.\n\nQuoting a Fox News report, Trump said, \"Democrats can\u2019t find a Smocking (sic) Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia...

Nadler said, however, \"There's nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the president from being indicted. Nobody should be above the law.\"\n\nDemocratic Congressman Adam Schiff, set to assume control of the House Intelligence Committee next month, told CBS News on Sunday, \"My takeaway is there's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.\"\n\nTrump has called for the end to the Mueller probe, but a Republican lawmaker, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, told ABC News, \"I've always supported the Mueller investigation and continue to do so because I think it's in the best interest of everyone involved, including, by the way, the president.\"\n\nAside from Cohen, Mueller so far has secured guilty pleas or won convictions of Trump's first national security adviser, his former campaign manager, his former deputy campaign manager, a foreign policy adviser and other lesser figures.\n\nBlaming Comey\n\nOn Sunday, Trump assailed former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey, whom Trump fired while he was heading the Russia investigation before Mueller was named to lead the probe. Comey testified to a House panel on Friday about his role in 2016 election-related investigations of Trump's campaign and that of his challenger, Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state.\n\n\"On 245 occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t recall, or couldn\u2019t remember things when asked,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\n\"Leakin\u2019 James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's office also laid out previously undisclosed contacts between Trump associates and Russian intermediaries and suggested the Kremlin aimed early on to influence Trump and his Republican campaign by playing to both his political and personal business interests.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has compared the investigations to a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nNadler, D-N.Y., said it was too early to say whether Congress would pursue impeachment proceedings based on the illegal payments alone because lawmakers would need to weigh the gravity of the offense to justify \u201coverturning\u201d the 2016 election. Nadler and other lawmakers said Sunday they would await additional details from Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with the Trump campaign to determine the extent of Trump's misconduct.\n\nRegarding the illegal payments, \u201cwhether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question, but certainly they'd be impeachable offenses because even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office,\u201d Nadler said.\n\nMueller has not said when he will complete a report of any findings, and it isn't clear that any such report would be made available to Congress. That would be up to the attorney general. Trump on Friday said he would nominate former Attorney General William Barr to the post to succeed Jeff Sessions.\n\nNadler indicated that Democrats, who will control the House in January, will step up their own investigations. He said Congress, the Justice Department and the special counsel need to dig deeper into the allegations, which include questions about whether Trump lied about his business arrangements with Russians and about possible obstruction of justice.\n\n\u201cThe new Congress will not try to shield the president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to get to the bottom of this, in order to serve the American people and to stop this massive conspiracy \u2014 this massive fraud on the American people.\u201d\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., also stressed a need to wait \u201cuntil we see the full picture.\u201d He has previously indicated his panel would seek to look into the Trump family's business ties with Russia.\n\n\u201cI think we also need to see this as a part of a broader pattern of potential misconduct by the president, and it's that broad pattern, I think, that will lead us to a conclusion about whether it rises to the level to warrant removal from office,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nIn the legal filings, the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Trump of directly committing a crime. But it said Trump told Cohen to make illegal payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump more than a decade ago.\n\nIn separate filings, Mueller's team detail how Cohen spoke to a Russian who \u201cclaimed to be a `trusted person' in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign `political synergy' and `synergy on a government level.\u201d' Cohen said he never followed up on that meeting. Mueller's team also said former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to them about his contacts with a Russian associate and Trump administration officials, including in 2018.\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called the latest filings \u201crelevant\u201d in judging Trump's fitness for office but said lawmakers need more information to render judgment. He also warned the White House about considering a pardon for Manafort, saying such a step could trigger congressional debate about limiting a president's pardon powers.\n\nSuch a move would be \u201ca terrible mistake,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cPardons should be used judiciously. They're used for cases with extraordinary circumstances.\u201d\n\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, cautioned against a rush to impeachment, which he said citizens could interpret as \u201cpolitical revenge and a coup against the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way to solve a problem like this, to me, is elections,\u201d King said. \u201cI'm a conservative when it comes to impeachment.

Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\n\nAyers, who is chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was seen as the favorite for the job when Trump announced Saturday that Kelly would leave around year's end. But a White House official said Sunday that Trump and Ayers could not reach agreement on Ayers' length of service and that he would instead assist the president from outside the administration. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matters.\n\nAyers confirmed the decision in a tweet Sunday, thanking Trump and Pence for giving him the opportunity to work in the White House. \"I will be departing at the end of the year but will work with the #MAGA team to advance the cause,'' he said.\n\n\n\nTrump offered his own take on the development: \"I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!''\n\n\n\nEven senior White House officials were caught off guard Sunday, most having believed the Ayers move was a done deal. No obvious successor to Kelly was in sight and there was some fretting that Trump may not be able to fill the job by the time Kelly leaves.\n\n\n\nAyers and Trump had discussed the job for months, making the breakdown Sunday all the more surprising. Trump said Saturday that he expected to announce a replacement for Kelly in a day or two. But with Ayers no longer waiting in the wings, Trump may now take until the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the president's thinking.\n\n\n\nMulvaney was not interested in becoming chief of staff, according to a person close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mulvaney has been saying for almost two months now that he would be more interested in becoming commerce or treasury secretary if that would be helpful to the president, the person said.\n\n\n\nAlso among those thought to be in the mix were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who said in a CBS interview that he hadn't spoken to anyone at the White House about the job and was \"entirely focused\" on his position. A person familiar with Mnuchin's thinking said he, too, was happy with his work at Treasury and had not sought the job of chief of staff.\n\n\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Trump's former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, were also among the names being floated by some close to the White House.\n\n\n\nTrump's administration has set records for staff turnover, and he has often struggled to attract experienced political professionals, a challenge that has grown more difficult by the upcoming threat of costly Democratic oversight investigations and an uncertain political environment.\n\n\n\nIn any administration, the role of White House chief of staff is split between the responsibilities of supervising the White House and managing the man sitting in the Oval Office. Striking that balance in the turbulent times of Trump has bedeviled both Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus, and will be the defining challenge for whomever is selected next.\n\n\n\nKelly, whose last day on the job is set to be Jan. 2, had been credited with imposing order on a chaotic West Wing after his arrival in June 2017 from his post as homeland security secretary. But his iron fist also alienated some longtime Trump allies, and over time he grew increasingly isolated.\n\n\n\nTrump wants his next chief of staff to hold the job through the 2020 election, the officials said. Ayers, who has young triplets, had long planned to leave the administration at the end of the year and had only agreed to serve in an interim basis through next spring.\n\n\n\nAyers had earned the backing of the president's influential daughter and son-in-law, White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, but was viewed warily by other aides.\n\n\n\nAyers will run a pro-Trump super PAC, according to a person familiar with his plans who was not authorized to discuss them by name.\n\n\n\nPence's deputy chief of staff, Jarrod Agen, is expected to assume Ayers' role for the vice president.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "France\u2019s Yellow Vests Attract Attention of Climate Change Conference", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-yellow-vests-attract-attention-of-un-climate-change-conference/4694268.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "Environment ministers from nearly 200 countries are arriving in the Polish city of Katowice to join haggling over ways to advance the 2015 Paris accord to curb climate change.

Climate Change Conference.\n\nMeanwhile, 1,500 kilometers away police in Paris battled Yellow Vest protesters mounting their fourth Saturday of action against the government of French President Emmanuel Macron, a revolt triggered initially by the imposition of higher taxes on fuel.\n\nFor Western governments, even environmentally-friendly ones, climate change poses a massive political dilemma the protests in France are bringing home.\n\nImpose the tax hikes and costly regulations scientists say are needed to lower emissions and move economies away from dependency on fossil fuels and governments risk prompting a backlash, largely from lower-income workers and pensioners who can ill-afford to bear the expense. Or move slowly and risk blow back from climate activists and their supporters among largely middle-class and higher-income groups able to adapt with less hardship.\n\nSquaring the circle between those who demand fast-track climate-friendly measures and those who want to slow down and mitigate the impact of moving towards a low-carbon future isn\u2019t going to be easy, as the Paris protests demonstrate, say analysts.\n\nPoland, which is hosting this year\u2019s conference, used the opening last Monday of the 24th U.N. climate change conference to emphasize the dilemma and to try to temper ambitions when delegates come to finalize the rule book for the Paris agreement to make the accord operational.\n\nAmong other things Polish leaders called for a \u201cjust transition\u201d for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, warning a badly managed transition to a low-carbon, renewable-energy future will cause major disruption to industry, hardship for ordinary people and could trigger social unrest not just in France, but in other industrialized nations.\n\nMany climate activists attending the conference dismiss warnings about social and political repercussions, seeing them as merely efforts to impede progress, apply the brakes and of providing specious justification for propping up fossil-fuel industries.\n\nBritish naturalist and documentary-maker David Attenborough gave voice to their frustration last week at the conference, warning time is running out to avert irreversible disaster.\n\n\u201cIf we don't take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon. The world's people have spoken, their message is clear, time is running out, they want you, the decision-makers, to act now. They're supporting you in making tough decisions, but they're also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives,\u201d he said.\n\nClimate activists remain furious that attempts to incorporate a key scientific study into the talks failed last week. U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, published in October, said the world is completely off track from curbing global warming and is heading towards a catastrophic three-centigrade jump in temperatures this century.\n\nFour oil-producing countries, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, opposed the inclusion of the IPCC report into the conference\u2019s key negotiating text. The report is likely to resurface in the final week of bargaining.\n\nThe issue of a \u201cjust transition\u201d is fast developing into one of the core climate-related issues governments are debating, and it is prompting the attention of investor organizations as well as organized labor.\n\n\u201cAs the world begins its much-needed transition from high-carbon to low-carbon economies, investors will have to look beyond physical environmental issues and consider the social aspects of workers and their communities who will be impacted by the move away from carbon-intensive industries,\u201d says Fiona Reynolds, chief executive of the Principles for Responsible Investment, an international network of major institutional investors."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Artificial Dyes Fading, But Food Will Still Get Color Boosts", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/artificial-dyes-fading-but-food-will-still-get-color-boosts/4694212.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "Many companies including McDonald's and Kellogg are purging artificial colors from their foods, but don't expect your cheeseburgers or cereal to look much different.\n\nColors send important signals about food, and companies aren't going to stop playing into those perceptions.\n\n\n\nWhat's accepted as normal can change, too, and vary by region. Up until the 1980s, Americans expected pistachios to be red because they were mostly imported from places where the nuts were dyed to cover imperfections.\n\n\n\n\"People used to get all the coloring all over their fingers. We now kind of laugh at that,\" said Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers, a trade association.\n\n\n\nNow most pistachios sold in the U.S. are grown domestically and come in their naturally pale shells.\n\n\n\nMcDonald's announced in September that it had removed artificial colors from many of its burgers and Kellogg has pledged to remove them from its cereals by the end of this year.\n\n\n\nAmericans, however, apparently aren't entirely ready to part with the technicolor pieces that float around in milk. After removing artificial colors from Trix, General Mills poured them back in last year to bring back a ``classic'' version in response to customer demand.\n\n\n\nBut it's not just processed and packaged foods that create illusions with colors.\n\n\n\nCheese\n\n\n\nBoar's Head, Cabot, Kraft, Tillamook. Check the packages of most cheddar cheeses, and they'll likely list an ingredient called annatto, a plant extract commonly used for color.\n\n\n\nThe practice reaches back to when cheesemakers in England skimmed the butterfat from milk to make butter, according to Elizabeth Chubbuck of Murray's Cheese in New York. The leftover milk was whiter, so cheesemakers added pigments to recreate butterfat's golden hue, she said.\n\n\n\nAnother cheese that sometimes gets cosmetic help: mozzarella.\n\n\n\nSara Burnett, director of food policy at Panera Bread, said mozzarella sometimes gets its bright white from titanium dioxide, a widely used ingredient in products like mints and doughnuts.\n\n\n\nWithout it, mozzarella would be beige or off-white.\n\n\n\nThe whitening is done because most U.S.-made mozzarella starts with cow's milk, which can have yellow hues, said Cathy Strange, global cheese buyer at Whole Foods.\n\n\n\nIn Italy, she said, mozzarella is traditionally made with water buffalo milk, which is whiter because the animal can't digest beta carotene.\n\n\n\nEgg yolks\n\n\n\nMany home cooks think darker egg yolks are fresher or more nutritious. But the color may be the result of marigold petals, alfalfa or coloring products in chicken feed.\n\n\n\nYolk color is primarily determined by the carotenoids \u2014 naturally occurring pigments in plants \u2014 that hens eat, according to Elizabeth Bobeck, a poultry nutrition professor at Iowa State University. It's easy to change yolk colors by simply altering hens' diet, she said.\n\n\n\nDarker yolks aren't necessarily healthier, Bobeck said. The belief that they are is likely rooted in the idea that yolks are darker when hens are fed a diet of fresh plants, which contain the pigments.\n\n\n\nMarc Dresner, a spokesman for the American Egg Board, said yolk colors varied more when chickens were fed whatever was available in the barnyard. Commercial feed has made yolk colors more consistent, but synthetic color additives are not allowed for chicken feed, Dresner said.\n\n\n\nBart Slaugh, a representative for Eggland's, noted mayonnaise and pasta makers may prefer paler yolks.\n\n\n\nSalmon\n\n\n\nBright pink flesh may signal freshness to shoppers eyeing salmon fillets, which is why farmed salmon may have been fed synthetic astaxanthin, a version of a naturally occurring compound.\n\n\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration notes that manufacturers have to declare on labeling if color additives were used for salmon. At Costco, farmed salmon is labeled with the disclosure \"color added through feed.\"\n\n\n\nIt may not sound appetizing, but manufacturers know the difference color can make.\n\n\n\nSalmon with a darker flesh can command an extra 50 cents to $1 per pound when offered side by side with lighter salmon, according to research by animal feed maker DSM.\n\n\n\nTo help producers size up the desirability of their salmon, the company offers a \"SalmoFan\" with varying shades of pink to help judge flesh colors.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives for DSM did not respond to requests for comment."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "As Climate Talks Stutter, Africa Suffers The Impact Of A Warming World", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4693818.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Efforts to boost global action against climate change are stuttering \u2013 as several key nations have objected to a key United Nations-backed report on the impacts of rising temperatures, at the COP24 talks in Poland.

So since then every year we have been experiencing these recessions,\u201d Chiotha said.\n\nScientists gathering at the COP24 climate talks say it is developing countries like Malawi that are being hit hardest by the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe charity Water Aid has released a report ranking the countries worst-hit by water shortages, with Sudan, Niger and Pakistan making up the top three.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are living with the impact of climate change right now. And they\u2019re feeling those impacts not through carbon, but through water.

Water Aid says they are failing to deliver the money.\n\nScientists say emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be reduced by 45 percent by 2030 to have any hope of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013 the target agreed in the Paris climate deal.\n\nHowever, the number of coal-fired power stations \u2013 the most polluting form of energy generation - is growing. The German organization \u2018Urgewald\u2019 calculates that $478 billion had been invested into expansion of the coal industry between January 2016 and September 2018.\n\n\u201cIn fourteen African countries now the first coal plants are being developed, it's completely crazy. Economies that could just be leap-frogging to a renewable energy economy, that instead are having - largely by foreign companies - having coal plants being pushed on them as the solution to energy problems,\u201d Urgewald\u2019s director Heffa Schucking told reporters in Katowice this week\n\nMeanwhile the World Health Organization warns that climate change will exacerbate the impact of some disease and health problems, including malaria, malnutrition and heat exposure.\n\nThere is little optimism at the talks that much concrete progress will be made, as several countries including the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia have already voiced objections to a key scientific report from the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Have not Endorsed a Key Study on Global Warming", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-climate-conference/4693805.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "As the U.N. global climate conference in Katowice, Poland entered its second week Sunday, the non-governmental environmental organization Greenpeace demanded urgent action from world leaders to tackle climate change.\n\nGreenpeace activists projected a message onto the roof of the \"Spodek\" arena where the COP24 is being held, saying \u201cNo Hope Without Climate Action: and \"Politicians Talk, Leaders Act.\"\n\nDisappointing many of the scientists and delegates at the conference, the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait refused to endorse a landmark study on global warming which was to be the benchmark for future action in curbing the global warming.\n\nThe four nations wanted only to \u201cnote\" but not \"welcome\" the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that was released in October, in keeping with the views of the Trump administration.

European Court of Justice has ruled that the UK can decide on its own to revoke its withdrawal from the European Union.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling comes the day before a crunch House of Commons vote on the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit deal, which she is anticipated to lose amid opposition from all sides.\n\nThe ECJ judgment read: \u201cThe Full Court has ruled that, when a Member State has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, as the UK has done, that Member State is free to revoke unilaterally that notification.\n\n\u201cSuch a revocation confirms the EU membership of the Member State concerned under terms that are unchanged as regards its status as a Member State and brings the withdrawal procedure to an end.\u201d\n\nThis is as long as a withdrawal agreement has not been enacted or concluded, and the possibility lasts until the end of the negotiation period which follows the triggering of Article 50.\n\nIt comes as the European Court of Justice issued non-binding advice that Britain could revoke Article 50 and halt Brexit, without other EU member states having to agree on it.\n\nManuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona, the ECJ advocate general, last week said Article 50 allows the \u201cunilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded\u201d.\n\nThe case was put forward by a group of cross-party politicians including Labour MPs, Green MSPs and SNP MPs, represented by Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project.\n\nAmong them were Labour MP Chris Leslie and Tom Brake MP of the Lib Dems.\n\n\u201cWe think that the option to stay as a member of the EU, on our current terms, is a credible and compelling alternative, to be considered in the national interest, right through Parliament\u2019s voting on Brexit,\u201d they said.\n\nBut lawyers for the government argued the case was inadmissible because it is dealing with a hypothetical situation as the government\u2019s policy is not to revoke Article 50.\n\nAdditionally, legal representatives for the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission believe revocation is possible, but that all EU member states would have to agree on this unanimously.\n\nWhat Is Article 50?\n\nArticle 50 of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty is a clause which details the formal withdrawal process for a member state wishing to leave the bloc.\n\nOne triggered, it is followed by a negotiation period of up to two years during which a withdrawal agreement is reached between the EU and the UK in this case.\n\nThe government triggered it on March 29, 2017, meaning the UK will cease to be a member of the European Union on that exact date next year.\n\nWhat Happens If The PM Loses The Meaningful Vote On Tuesday?\n\nA loss in the Commons could lead to the loss of her job as a vote of no confidence in her leadership would likely follow.\n\nOtherwise, Theresa May might seek to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, or could face MPs pushing for a softer \u201cplan B\u201d option in the form of a Norway-style deal.\n\nThis option could see Britain staying in the European Economic Area and therefore the single market, which would reduce trade barriers with the bloc, and see a continuation of freedom of movement.\n\nThe last resort could be a risky no-deal Brexit, which May has warned against.\n\nThis would see the UK cut off cold from the EU with potentially dire consequences. The Bank of England has warned the economy could be plunged into crisis and the pound could crash.\n\nBrexiteers, on the other hand, are much more optimistic about this option, saying that no-deal is better than the one currently on the table.\n\nWhat Are The Chances Of A Second Referendum?\n\nCalls for a People\u2019s Vote are growing louder, and could gain even more traction after today\u2019s ruling.\n\nCabinet members business secretary Greg Clark and justice secretary David Gauke are among those who believe another vote is likely, according to The Telegraph."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Police Take 1-Year-Old Away From Mother", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-take-1-year-old-away-from-mother_us_5c0eb321e4b0d3663bd1a62c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "NYPD Probes 'Troubling' Video Of Cops Ripping 1-Year-Old From Mother\u2019s Arms", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-brooklyn-mother-baby_us_5c0e7d3fe4b08bcb27eaa254", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "The New York Police Department is investigating a video shared on Facebook that shows officers yanking a 1-year-old baby from his mother\u2019s arms at a government assistance center.\n\nThe roughly 2 1/2-minute video, captured Friday by Nyashia Ferguson on her cellphone at a city Human Resources Administration office in Brooklyn, is \u201ctroubling,\u201d the NYPD said in a statement on Sunday.

Yet Trump always managed to change the subject, his public shrugged, Republicans continued to support him, and Trump rolled merrily on.\n\nThis time could be different. The stage is now set for what appears to be an inexorable path to impeachment or resignation.\n\nLet\u2019s review what special counsel Robert Mueller has on Trump. Based on the most recent combined filings of the special counsel and prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, the evidence is piling up to document the following:\n\n\n\n1. In September 2015, Trump personally approved the plan of personal lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen to make high-level contacts with the Russian government to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen, according to Mueller\u2019s seven-page memo, continued to talk with \u201cIndividual-1\u201d \u2015 Donald Trump \u2015 well into the campaign. Even after Trump was nominated, these conversations continued, and with Trump\u2019s full knowledge.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russians were doing their level best to help Trump get elected, including serious mischief to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and Trump was publicly and privately calling for a much friendlier American foreign policy stance toward Vladimir Putin, something wildly improbable for a Republican candidate and later president.\n\n2. Trump misrepresented the nature of key meetings with senior Kremlin-connected Russians to discuss their collaboration for mutual benefit, including dirt on Hillary Clinton. Contrary to his earlier protestations, he was fully knowledgeable about the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower, which featured Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, in close communication with Trump senior. Trump has repeatedly lied about this.\n\n3. In another ring of the circus, Cohen confirmed to prosecutors that he advanced hush money for two women who said they had affairs with Trump, including the porn actress Stormy Daniels, and that this done at the direction of the same Individual-1 in order to protect his campaign \u2014 a felony. And evidence keeps piling up that Trump took actions as president to use his office to profit from his various hotel properties, and to win other financial favors from various foreign governments.\n\nIn Watergate, the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Richard Nixon on three counts \u2015 obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. Trump has more than met the Nixon standard.\n\nStill to come from Mueller could be more detail on tax evasion and possible money laundering by the Trump Organization, or bribes paid to foreigners in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. And, in what may get himself even further into big trouble, Trump has publicly suggested that he might pardon former campaign manager Manafort for making a deal with the special counsel and then double-crossing Mueller.\n\nSo what does all this add up to?\n\nWe have clear obstruction of justice in Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey after unsuccessfully pressing Comey to go easy on Trump allies, plus multiple attempts, most recently via Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, to rein in Mueller, and the use of proffered pardons to tamper with witnesses.\n\nWe have an open-and-shut case of violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which prohibits an officer of the United States from profiting from public office. We have something close to treason in the 180-degree reversal of U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, following negotiations with the Russians about a Moscow tower and Russian help to Trump in the campaign.\n\nAnd with Cohen\u2019s admissions, we have a criminal violation of campaign finance laws, with the added possible elements of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nAll of these are clearly impeachable offenses, and some of them create criminal liability as well. In Watergate, the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Richard Nixon on three counts \u2015 obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. Trump has more than met the Nixon standard.\n\nToya Sarno Jordan via Getty Images Incoming House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is one of the Democrats who will be able to act on the findings of the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe broad outline of this story has been hidden in plain view for more than a year. Mueller\u2019s latest memos, indictments and plea deals provide solid documentation.\n\nThere remains the question of whether Trump could be indicted while in office. That issue has never been settled constitutionally. Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski strongly implied that Nixon could be prosecuted when he named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator. Mueller seems to be taking the same approach by mentioning Individual-1, who is unmistakably Trump, but leaving his options open.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats take charge of the House in just three weeks. So what happens next?\n\nIn effect, Mueller hands off whatever loose ends remain to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. They will call and, if necessary, subpoena witnesses and documents.\n\nThe Democrats can\u2019t get ahead of public opinion. They need to build a bulletproof case, step by step, and then proceed to a formal impeachment. In Watergate, that took a full two years.\n\nThere are some, such as billionaire activist and possible presidential candidate Tom Steyer, who want the House to proceed directly to impeachment. There are many others who argue that impeachment would be a distraction at a time when Trump keeps doing himself in politically.\n\nBoth of these counsels are wrong, in my view. Other investigations need to proceed first, as incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler keeps pointing out. The Democrats can\u2019t get ahead of public opinion. They need to build a bulletproof case, step by step, and then proceed to a formal impeachment. In Watergate, that took a full two years.\n\nIn this case, because Mueller has already laid most of the groundwork, impeachment would likely come in 2019, well before the 2020 election.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s crimes, it would be a real shirking of constitutional duty not to impeach. And contrary to those who argue that impeachment would be a distraction, it could well be smart politics.\n\nThe case for impeaching Trump is so overwhelming that it will put the 10 Senate Republicans with vulnerable seats in 2020 or 2022 in an awkward position. And others, even relative loyalists, may decide the time has come to trade in Trump for Vice President Mike Pence. Relations between the Republican Senate and Trump are nothing if not opportunist, cynical and transactional.\n\nYou might say that trading Trump for Pence is not good for the Democrats, but think again. Pence has nothing of Trump\u2019s feral charisma, he is a lousy politician, and he would be presiding over a fractured party.\n\nSo, my bet is that Trump will be gone by November 2020. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball to tell you how. It could be by impeachment; it could be via resignation after Republican senators make him an offer he can\u2019t refuse; or through a deal that spares him and his family prosecution if he leaves office. Or he might get so angry that he just turns into a puddle, like the wicked witch of the west."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Block Endorsement Of Global Warming Study", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-russia-saudi-arabia-kuwait-block-endorsement-of-global-warming-study_us_5c0e51a8e4b0ab8cf69563ee", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "KATOWICE, Poland (AP) \u2014 A diplomatic standoff over a single word could set the stage for a bigger showdown during the second half of this year\u2019s U.N. climate summit.\n\nNegotiators took time out Sunday to rest after the first week of talks ended on a sour note the previous night, when the United States sided with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in blocking endorsement of a landmark study on global warming.\n\n\u201cI think it was a key moment,\u201d said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThe fact that a group of four countries were trying to diminish the value and importance of a scientific report they themselves, with all other countries, requested three years ago in Paris is pretty remarkable.\u201d\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s special report on what would happen if average global temperatures rise by 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), and how to ensure they don\u2019t go higher, was widely regarded as a wake-up call for policy-makers when it was released in October .\n\nAs diplomats wrapped up a week of technical talks Saturday, almost all 200 countries present in Katowice, Poland, had wanted to \u201cwelcome\u201d the IPCC report, making it the benchmark for future action.\n\nBut the U.S. and three other delegations objected.\n\n\u201cThe United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report,\u201d the U.S. State Department said in a statement. \u201cAs we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies, the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report.\u201d\n\nRussia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also called for the study to be \u201cnoted\u201d but not \u201cwelcomed.\u201d\n\nWhile none of the four-oil exporting countries spelled it out, their objection to the report likely included its suggestion that fossil-fuel use needs to be phased out by 2050. Oil, gas and coal are major sources of carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere.\n\nThe 2015 Paris agreement set a target of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 C by the end of the century.\n\n\u201cA 1.5 C and a 2 C worlds are very different in terms of mean climate, extremes, sea level rise, and climate-related risks,\u201d said one of the report\u2019s leading contributors, Valerie Masson-Delmotte.\n\nThe higher threshold increases the likelihood of \u201cclimate change hot spots challenging basic water, food, economic security and the risk of irreversible loss of wildlife,\u201d she said.\n\nObservers at the talks said the two Gulf countries\u2019 objection to the IPCC report came as no surprise.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis with their sidekicks the Kuwaitis have long been troublemakers in this in this process,\u201d said Meyer, who has followed international climate negotiations for many years.\n\nRussia\u2019s intentions were unclear, he said, while the U.S. position appeared to be driven by what he called President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ccavalier attitude toward science in general and climate science in particular.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an embarrassment for the world\u2019s leading scientific superpower to be in this position of having to disbelieve a report that was written by the world\u2019s scientific community including a large number of pre-eminent U.S. scientists,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s floor fight casts doubt on whether countries will be able to reach consensus on important issues by Friday, including the need to step up national targets to curb carbon emissions.\n\nWhile many countries are sending ministers or even national leaders to the talks, the U.S. and Britain are among the countries that will be represented only by bureaucrats.\n\n___\n\nFollow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Eyes Four New Candidates For Chief Of Staff", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-looking-at-several-candidates-for-chief-of-staff_us_5c0e5a81e4b0a606a9aae141", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing at least four people to serve as his next chief of staff, after plans for an orderly succession for departing John Kelly fell through.\n\nThe high-profile hiring search comes at a pivotal time as the president looks to prepare his White House for the twin challenges of securing his re-election and fending off inquiries once Democrats gain control of the House next year.\n\nTrump\u2019s top pick for the job, Nick Ayers, is out of the running and Trump is now soliciting input on at least four individuals, including Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nAyers, who is chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was seen as the favorite for the job when Trump announced Saturday that Kelly would leave around year\u2019s end. But a White House official said Sunday that Trump and Ayers could not reach agreement on Ayers\u2019 length of service and that he would instead assist the president from outside the administration. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matters.\n\nAyers confirmed the decision in a tweet Sunday, thanking Trump and Pence for giving him the opportunity to work in the White House. \u201cI will be departing at the end of the year but will work with the #MAGA team to advance the cause,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump offered his own take on the development: \u201cI am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!\u201d\n\nEven senior White House officials were caught off guard Sunday, most having believed the Ayers move was a done deal. No obvious successor to Kelly was in sight and there was some fretting that Trump may not be able to fill the job by the time Kelly leaves.\n\nAyers and Trump had discussed the job for months, making the breakdown Sunday all the more surprising. Trump said Saturday that he expected to announce a replacement for Kelly in a day or two. But with Ayers no longer waiting in the wings, Trump may now take until the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking.\n\nMulvaney was not interested in becoming chief of staff, according to a person close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mulvaney has been saying for almost two months now that he would be more interested in becoming commerce or treasury secretary if that would be helpful to the president, the person said.\n\nAlso among those thought to be in the mix were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who said in a CBS interview that he hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone at the White House about the job and was \u201centirely focused\u201d on his position. A person familiar with Mnuchin\u2019s thinking said he, too, was happy with his work at Treasury and had not sought the job of chief of staff.\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, were also among the names being floated by some close to the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has set records for staff turnover, and he has often struggled to attract experienced political professionals, a challenge that has grown more difficult by the upcoming threat of costly Democratic oversight investigations and an uncertain political environment.\n\nIn any administration, the role of White House chief of staff is split between the responsibilities of supervising the White House and managing the man sitting in the Oval Office. Striking that balance in the turbulent times of Trump has bedeviled both Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus, and will be the defining challenge for whomever is selected next.\n\nKelly, whose last day on the job is set to be Jan. 2, had been credited with imposing order on a chaotic West Wing after his arrival in June 2017 from his post as homeland security secretary. But his iron fist also alienated some longtime Trump allies, and over time he grew increasingly isolated.\n\nTrump wants his next chief of staff to hold the job through the 2020 election, the officials said. Ayers, who has young triplets, had long planned to leave the administration at the end of the year and had only agreed to serve in an interim basis through next spring.\n\nAyers had earned the backing of the president\u2019s influential daughter and son-in-law, White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, but was viewed warily by other aides.\n\nAyers will run a pro-Trump super PAC, according to a person familiar with his plans who was not authorized to discuss them by name.\n\nPence\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Jarrod Agen, is expected to assume Ayers\u2019 role for the vice president.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "French Government Slams Trump: Stop Interfering And 'Leave Our Nation Be'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-donald-trump-macron-interfering_us_5c0de37ee4b0a606a9aa104b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The French government has asked President Donald Trump to keep his nose out of the country\u2019s politics after he weighed in on the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests.\n\nAs anti-government demonstrators faced off against riot police in the fourth weekend of demonstrations across France on Saturday, Trump fired off a series of misguided tweets blaming the Paris Agreement for the unrest.\n\n\u201cThe Paris Agreement isn\u2019t working out so well for Paris,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cProtests and riots all over France.

Prime-time Fox News programs used the words \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cinvaders\u201d to describe migrants and asylum-seekers more times in the 30 days leading up to the Nov. 6 election than they did during all of 2015, 2016 and 2017 combined.\n\nI used transcripts to analyze the use of the terms \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cinvaders\u201d to refer to immigrants or asylum seekers on Fox News prime-time programming from Jan. 1, 2015, to Nov. 30, 2018. The analysis shows that, although the network was pushing anti-immigrant rhetoric before Trump announced his candidacy, a noticeable uptick occurred in the months around the 2018 midterm election. Prime-time Fox News hosts and guests used the words to refer to migrants 33 times in the 30 days ahead of the election, up from 25 times in all of 2015, 2016 and 2017. Fox has kept up the attacks in the weeks after the Republicans lost the U.S. House: Prime-time hosts and guests used the terms 48 times between Election Day and the end of November. Most of the mentions came from Fox hosts Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson.\n\nCalling migrants \u201cinvaders\u201d is a long-honored right-wing media rhetorical tradition. In 2002, far-right pundit Michelle Malkin \u2015 who regularly appears on Fox News, often to attack immigrants and refugees \u2015 published an anti-immigrant book called Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals and Other Foreign Menaces to Our Shores. In 2015, Fox News used the term to spread anti-Muslim rhetoric in the context of the European refugee crisis. Ousted host and alleged serial sexual harasser Bill O\u2019Reilly branded the humanitarian issue as a \u201cMuslim invasion\u201d in his Sept. 15 show that year. During an episode that aired about a month later, O\u2019Reilly and his guest Monica Crowley focused on the \u201cfighting age\u201d or virility of those seeking asylum. Trump\u2019s former top adviser, Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, was another fan of the idea; he often describes The Camp of the Saints, a racist 1970s French novel about a literal invasion of Europe by people from other continents, as a prophetic description about the present.\n\nAnd Trump is far from the first Republican candidate to borrow from Fox News\u2019 bigoted rhetoric for electoral gain. Fox News favorite Bobby Jindal attempted to run for president by regularly using the slogan \u201cimmigration without assimilation is invasion,\u201d hammering on it throughout his short-lived candidacy.\n\nThe right-wing media noise machine has grown significantly since 2015, and the results of Trump and Fox\u2019s symbiotic relationship clearly has the power of inspiring extremists. The right-wing echo chamber now includes anonymous message boards like 4chan and 8chan \u2015 two video hosting platforms that amplified Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theories by airing content from his site Infowars \u2015 and social media networks like Gab, where extremists get further radicalized.\n\nWhen I analyzed \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d boards on anonymous forums 4chan and 8chan, I found that more than 2,200 posts referred to migrant caravans with the terms invasion or invaders. The trend showed an observable spike on Oct. 22, a day Trump tweeted repeatedly about the caravan.\n\nThe man behind the hate-fueled shooting on Oct. 27 in a Pittsburgh synagogue, for example, had posted six days before the shooting on the \u201chaven for white nationalists\u201d site Gab that he had \u201cnoticed a change\u201d in the way people on the platforms referred to immigrants. \u201cPeople saying \u2018illegals\u2019 \u2026 now say \u2019invaders,\u201d he noted. \u201cI like this,\u201d he added. His last post before the shooting attacked HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that helps refugees resettle in the U.S., for bringing in \u201cinvaders.\u201d\n\nAlex Jones repeatedly pushed the invasion narrative throughout October. Jones, whose extremist posts got him kicked off of multiple social media platforms, has previously bragged on air about his access to Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nAnd yet, President Trump and his right-wing media figures refuse to connect the dots between their rhetoric and the extremism it inspires or take responsibility for mainstreaming and empowering extremists.\n\nWhite supremacist podcasts praise Tucker Carlson, for elevating their discourse into the mainstream. Yet Carlson denies having any influence on them."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "James Comey: If Trump Weren't President He'd Be 'In Serious Jeopardy' Over Cohen", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-trump-cohen-92-y_us_5c0dc4e6e4b035a7bf5c73c0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "James Comey, the former director of the FBI, speculated Sunday that if President Donald Trump weren\u2019t the leader of the country he\u2019d be \u201cin serious jeopardy of being charged\u201d as part of the government\u2019s sweeping indictments of the lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nDuring a conversation with MSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace at the 92nd Street Y on Sunday evening, Comey spoke about his time in the White House, his newfound status as a perpetual target of Trump\u2019s Twitter tirades and his thoughts on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cBob Mueller and his team have done this like pros,\u201d Comey said, noting that someone once said the special counsel was \u201can olympic swimmer and we\u2019re dog paddlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that that\u2019s true,\u201d the former director continued.\n\nThe talk began with Comey discussing his thoughts on Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and longtime fixer. Cohen will be sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws through hush money payments to two women who claim they had affairs with the president, among other crimes. In a memo filed last week, federal prosecutors said Cohen did so \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of Trump.\u201d\n\nJustice Department policy mandates a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted. But during the talk, Wallace asked whether Trump could be considered an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the case, a term previously used in regards to President Richard Nixon during the Watergate investigation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Comey replied, \u201cNot in the formal sense where he\u2019s been named in an indictment. But if he\u2019s not there, he\u2019s certainly close given the language in the filing that the crimes were committed at his direction.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Michael Cohen, former lawyer to President Donald Trump, leaves his apartment building on New York's Park Avenue, Friday, Dec. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nWallace then asked hypothetically if Trump wasn\u2019t the president and a similar case were before the a judge in the Southern District of New York, where Comey was once the U.S. Attorney, what would happen.\n\n\u201cWell that person would be in serious jeopardy of being charged because the government wouldn\u2019t make that sponsoring allegation if they weren\u2019t seriously contemplating going forward with criminal charges,\u201d the former FBI director said. \u201cNow where it stands here, I can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nComey, who released a memoir of his time in politics and interactions with the president earlier this year, also spoke about Trump\u2019s ongoing use of Twitter to lambast the Mueller investigation and overt attacks and defenses of those cooperating with and opposing the special counsel\u2019s probe.\n\n\u201cIf I were a prosecutor and a public figure started attacking the credibility of one of my witnesses in a pending investigation, that\u2019s something I\u2019d look at very closely,\u201d Comey said when pressed on the tweets by Wallace.\n\nThe former director has been a common target of the president himself, who just this weekend leveled new attacks, calling him \u201cLeakin\u2019 James Comey\u201d and accusing the man of lying to Congress. Comey testified before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees on Friday after a fierce negotiation with Republicans who wanted to compel him to speak about his leadership at the FBI, including his handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. Comey only agreed after lawmakers agreed to make his testimony public within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cLeakin\u2019 James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day,\u201d Trump wrote without basis this weekend. \u201cHis Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!\u201d\n\nOn 245 occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t recall, or couldn\u2019t remember things when asked.

This menu comes from the United Nations climate talks taking place in Poland this month \u2015 a series of discussions aimed at coming up with solutions for saving the planet.\n\nWith multiple warnings from scientists in the past few weeks about the climate effects of eating meat and our need to reduce overconsumption, the menu for delegates was quickly criticized as hypocritical.\n\nMeat and dairy production represents 14.5 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Unless we cut back on our overconsumption of meat in rich countries, it will be almost impossible, climate analysts say, to prevent global warming from bringing temperatures up by a dangerous 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\u201cThe meat-laden menu at COP24 is an insult to the work of the conference,\u201d said Stephanie Feldstein, director of the population and sustainability program at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be serving up cheeseburgers at climate conferences if we\u2019re going to have an honest conversation about the role of food in the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nBetween 2010 and 2050, global meat and dairy consumption is on course to increase by nearly 70 percent, according to data published by the World Resources Institute. Shifting the diets of higher-income consumers toward plant-based foods is vital, climate researchers say, to prevent runaway climate change.\n\nI kept asking myself, what\u2019s Al Gore eating? Turns out he took a packed lunch with him from his hotel each day. Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green\n\nIf the U.N. conference organizers had replaced the beef burgers with plant-based ones, it would have cut the climate emissions associated with each burger by 82 percent, campaigners pointed out.\n\n\u201cWhile meat doesn\u2019t need to be entirely eliminated from global diets in order to meet climate goals, the conference menu should reflect the way forward, which means mostly plant-based dishes and smaller portions of meat and dairy when they are used,\u201d Feldstein said. \u201cMeat and dairy can no longer be the default.\u201d\n\nIt was only in October that the U.N.\u2019s own climate advisers listed dietary changes as an effective strategy for tackling climate change. But delegates and campaigners say food is still treated as an afterthought in U.N. climate talks.\n\n\u201cComing from civil society in Sweden, where vegetarian food is the norm in most NGOs no matter their focus, I think it is shocking,\u201d said Lotta Velin, Sweden\u2019s youth delegate to the U.N. climate talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hugely surprised that the menu at COP24 is meat- and dairy-heavy, but it sends a strange and unhelpful message nonetheless,\u201d said Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green, a public policy organization. \u201cAt the Paris climate talks it was really hard to eat as a vegan. I kept asking myself, what\u2019s Al Gore eating? Turns out he took a packed lunch with him from his hotel each day!\u201d\n\nMacDonald said the big and \u201cdeeply problematic\u201d issue is not the meaty menu at the U.N. talks, but the lack of concrete policies to reduce emissions from livestock production and consumption and the failure to promote more plant-based alternatives.\n\nThat lack of progress is because governments are wary of trying to tell people what to eat, says Richard Waite, a food specialist at WRI. \u201cThere\u2019s been more attention about how to mitigate the impact on agriculture, but not dietary change and consumers. So even though awareness of diet and climate link is growing, there is still this cognitive distance,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat can make a difference for now, WRI says, is encouraging more companies and restaurants to improve the availability of plant-based alternatives.\n\nU.S. retail sales of plant-based meats have risen 17 percent over the past year, with 39 percent of American consumers working to incorporate more plant-based foods in their diets. The catering company Sodexo has launched 200 plant-based and plant-rich recipes in the U.S. The fast-food chain Max Burgers has set a goal that by 2022, half of all meals it sells at its 120 restaurants worldwide will be made of foods other than beef.\n\n\u201cIn the future, a lot of progress will depend on whether we really have substitutes that are close to the experience of meat and cheaper,\u201d said Tim Searchinger, a lecturer at Princeton University and fellow at WRI. \u201cAnd we are seeing that with the enormously tastier plant-based burgers coming on the market. Over time, they are going to be cheaper. In the long run, a lot of these things will be determined by availability and price.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "SNL's Vanessa Bayer Talks Battling Leukemia And Her Epic End-Of-Chemo Party", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vanessa-bayer-leukemia_us_5c0d5d80e4b035a7bf5c4903", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Monica Schipper via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer attends the premiere of the Netflix film \"Ibiza\" last May in New York.\n\nVanessa Bayer is eternally cheerful \u2015 even when she\u2019s talking about her battle with blood cancer.\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star, who left the show in 2017 after seven seasons of Rachel Green impressions and Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy sketches, recently spoke with HuffPost about having leukemia as a teenager and her new partnership with Gift of Life \u2015 a bone marrow registry dedicated to fighting blood cancer.\n\nSomehow Bayer \u2015 known for her megawatt smile \u2015 manages to make talking about her battle with blood cancer like just another thing that happens to anyone \u2014 like something as simple as getting stitches or a cast for a broken bone.\n\nAside from opening up about defeating cancer, the 37-year-old comedian also spoke about her epic end-of-chemo party that got busted by the police, Pete Davidson ruling the headlines this summer and, of course, performing that infamous \u201cPorn Stars\u201d sketch with Donald Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nNBC via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer, Donald Trump and Cecily Strong during the Nov. 7, 2015, \"Porn Stars\" sketch on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHow did you get involved with Gift of Life?\n\nThey came to me. As a survivor of blood cancer \u2015 it was just something really close to my heart. And when I heard about their amazing work that they\u2019ve done I definitely wanted to get involved.\n\nTell me about your childhood and battling cancer.\n\nWhen I was 15 I was diagnosed with ALL \u2015 acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u2015 and so I was treated for about two-and-a-half years. It was obviously a difficult thing to go through. I do think surviving something like that definitely affected my sense of humor and made me want to go into comedy because my family, my friends and I all laughed about it a lot.\n\nI was very lucky because once I was treated for leukemia it never recurred, but I know that had it recurred there was a likelihood I would have had to get a bone marrow transplant. The Gift of Life registry was created out of someone needing a bone marrow transplant and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so close to my heart.\n\nHow did you find out that you had blood cancer?\n\nIt generally shows somewhere and my eyes swelled up. I getting sick and not getting better \u2015 this was all in ninth grade. I was having all of these issues and then I was diagnosed. I think they took a sample \u2015 biopsied my bone marrow or something \u2015 and saw that I had it. Again, I was 15 and it\u2019s a long treatment but it\u2019s curable right now. I was very lucky.\n\nWhat was it like to hear that you had cancer? Who was in the room with you?\n\nI feel like my parents were in the room with me \u2015 it was such a long time ago. It was definitely a scary thing, but I had a lot of support from my family and I was always very optimistic in general. I always felt like I was on a path to recovery.\n\nWhat would you say to someone who\u2019s scared to sign up for the registry?\n\nI understand, but it\u2019s actually not a scary thing at all. Basically, the way that the process works is that you get swabbed and if you find out that you\u2019re a match you do something that\u2019s similar to giving plasma or platelets, basically blood is drawn.\n\nThey take the stem cells out of it and then they give you back the blood. It\u2019s nothing scary, it\u2019s nothing crazy. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest misconceptions \u2015 that giving stem cells or giving bone marrow is this scary thing and it\u2019s not.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Bayer talking about battling blood cancer on the \"Today\" show on Nov. 30.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t know what to say when someone has cancer. What would you want them to know?\n\nI think the most important thing with someone with cancer or any kind of illness is just to say something. And just remember that it\u2019s the same person and they\u2019re still your friend or your colleague. I think it\u2019s just important to show up for that person.\n\nWhat did you think of someone like Tig Notaro integrating cancer into her comedy?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing. I mean, she is so funny. I think she was on \u201cConan\u201d when she did that bit where she was like \u201ccancer has made me be so much more present,\u201d and then she was like, looking on her cell phone. I mean, she\u2019s a genius. I think it\u2019s great [she talks about cancer in her work]. It\u2019s kind of like what we were saying before \u2015 if someone has cancer or has something, they\u2019re still the same person. And I think when someone can joke about it, it puts everyone else at ease a little bit.\n\nHow did having leukemia shape your comedy?\n\nIn college I was in this all-female sketch group called Bloomers. But I just think in general in my comedy there were just so many funny and interesting and awkward moments when I was sick. I think that kind of getting through that made me be able to see funny things in all situations.\n\nWhat were some of the awkward moments about getting sick?\n\nWell, I mean anyone who spends a lot of the time in the hospital knows and, by the way, I\u2019m not like \u2015 my comedy isn\u2019t full of poop jokes or anything, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re so monitored on how much, your poop is checked so much. You know, it\u2019s important. Whenever you\u2019re in a hospital setting, they\u2019re always kind of like, \u201cDid you go?\u201d\n\nHow many times were you asked that [did you go]?\n\nI just feel like I was asked it all the time. When you\u2019re in a hospital setting, [Bayer turns to her PR team laughing and says \u201cIs this a great thing for me to be talking about?\u201d] pooping is important. And my best friend Gwen is a nurse and she\u2019s like \u201cYeah, you gotta [ask].\u201d\n\nHow long were you in the hospital?\n\nI was in and out. When I was first there, I was there for a couple weeks, but then I\u2019d have to go in for certain procedures or if something came up I\u2019d have to go back. I had the most intensive treatment for 10 months and then I had what they call maintenance chemo for two more years after that. I think the summer before my senior year of high school is when I finally stopped chemo. And I had an end-of-chemo party.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nIt was so fun. My parents got me a really big cake. I think I had a big sheet cake and I think it said, \u201cHappy End-of-Chemo Vanessa\u201d or something and so many of my friends came and it was so fun. And then my brother was in a band and his band played in our backyard and then the police came \u2019cause they thought that it was like a \u201crager\u201d \u2015 my parents and I were just talking about this over Thanksgiving.\n\nThe police thought we were drinking and we were like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re literally celebrating the end of me having chemo.\u201d My parents said they were going through the trash and trying to find bottles and stuff and [we were like] this couldn\u2019t be a more positive party. We\u2019re literally just celebrating the end of me having chemo.\n\nWhat did the police end up doing?\n\nI think they finally left, but said \u2019cause of the noise my brother\u2019s band had to stop playing.\n\nHow did you balance having cancer with applying for colleges?\n\nWell, I guess \u2015 if you really think about it \u2015 I had a great thing to write a college essay about.\n\nI did think about that. But just the amount of work that goes into applying for school, too.\n\nI guess I was just hyper-focused on school because I wanted to make sure that having this illness wouldn\u2019t affect my future. Especially once the more intense of my chemo [treatments] were over, I really was so focused on school. It was really a priority for me.\n\nWhat did you go to school for? What did you think you were going to do?\n\nI thought I would maybe be a biology major [at the University of Pennsylvania, where Bayer went] because I thought that I could do medical research and stuff like that. But then everyone was so smart [laughs].\n\nI was in some really intense science classes and I always thought that I wanted to be a medical researcher who was on TV or something, so then I was like, \u201cOh I think I want to be on TV.\u201d So I actually ended up being a communications major, and I was a French major as well because I studied abroad.\n\nHow did you go from college to being on \u201cSNL\u201d about six years later?\n\nI made the transition from biology pretty quickly my freshman year. I did this sketch group, Bloomers, in college and I performed a lot. I also interned one summer at \u201cConan\u201d and I kind of realized that I wanted to pursue comedy when I was in college. I moved to Chicago after school and I started taking classes at Second City and the iO [theater] and The Annoyance [Theater] and stuff.\n\nAnd I saw that you interned at Sesame Street \u2015 what was that like?\n\nIt was over the summer so they weren\u2019t in production, but it was really magical. We got to go to the set once and it was really amazing.\n\nWhat memories do you have from your first and your last day at \u201cSaturday Night Live?\u201d\n\nI remember from my first day just meeting a lot of the other cast and just being so starstruck by them. And just being like okay, I\u2019m going to have to act like this is normal until I think that it\u2019s normal. And then my last day was just so special, I just remember we were being carried off stage and stuff and it was just so amazing.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer getting carried off stage after her last \"SNL\" show on May 20, 2017.\n\nWhy did you leave?\n\nI just felt like it was time. I just had this feeling like it\u2019s time for me to go and I knew that the show was in such great hands with Aidy [Bryant] and Kate [McKinnon] and Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney and everybody.\n\nHow do you tell Lorne Michaels that you were leaving?\n\nI think that we had a discussion about it. He\u2019s always been very supportive. So I feel like I can be very honest with him. I felt like we had a very honest conversation about it.\n\nWas it hard to tell the cast that you were leaving? When did you tell them?\n\nI don\u2019t remember it exactly. I feel like everyone was supportive and we\u2019ll miss you, but we understand. It\u2019s a very hectic schedule so it\u2019s like, after seven years, I want to take a nap [laughs].\n\nSpeaking of that, your New York Times \u201cSunday Routine\u201d has a cult following . Why do you think it resonates so much?\n\nYou know, someone else just brought this up to me. That\u2019s really nice. I do think that normally those \u201cSunday Routines\u201d are so busy and I think it just makes you feel bad about yourself. Like, I don\u2019t get up at six a.m. and make breakfast with my kids or whatever and go to, like, spin class. I think it puts people at ease that most of us are just ordering bagels and then spending whatever I said, spending like 10 minutes being mad that it\u2019s not toasted.\n\nAnd [as you mentioned in your NYT piece] it\u2019s such a New York thing to wonder what your doorman thinks of you. What do you think your doorman thinks of you?\n\nWell, in my building now, not to brag, but I have several different doormen. So I could order breakfast and if I wait two hours and order lunch, they don\u2019t know. But you know if I order multiple dinners, they\u2019re gonna know.\n\nWhat do you think most people\u2019s impression of you is? How do you think you come across to fans?\n\nI think most people think I\u2019m just like a stone-cold bitch.\n\nREALLY?\n\nNo [laughs]. I think everyone knows that I smile a lot so they probably think that I\u2019m pretty nice, but again\u2026 [shrugs].\n\nNBC via Getty Images Michael Che and Vanessa Bayer as 'Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy' during \"Weekend Update\" on \"SNL\" on April 15, 2017.\n\nWhat do people \u2015 when they recognize you on the street \u2015 what do they say to you?\n\nSometimes people think they\u2019ve gone to high school with me. But people are generally very nice. A lot of guys mention [my \u201cSNL\u201d character] the Bar Mitzvah Boy and say they can relate to that time in their life. But people are generally very nice or they think they know me from high school. \u2019Cause you know, we wore so many wigs on \u201cSNL,\u201d so they know your face, but they\u2019re just like, \u201cNew Jersey?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNope.\u201d\n\nIs it weird that people you\u2019ve known for so long, like Pete Davidson, can suddenly be every headline in the news?\n\nYeah, I guess so, although that happens a lot, you know what I mean? I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people that I\u2019ve known that that\u2019s happened to. And that stuff\u2019s always kind of, you know, it has a moment and then it dies down \u2015 thank goodness for them \u2015 \u2019cause it\u2019s a lot.\n\nIt is ever a lot for you when people ask you personal questions, like are you dating?\n\nYeah, I mean it is, but I feel like it sort of comes with the territory. And you know, I never feel like I have to answer everything.\n\nBut you did talk to Drake about JDate [an online dating service for Jewish singles] one time.\n\nYes, Drake did my web series [\u201cSound Advice\u201d], which I did with my brother. And yeah, he was a great sport about it. I mean, I was kind of asking him in character, but apparently he\u2019s not on JDate. Which, missed opportunity, right?\n\nWhat\u2019s your inspiration for the character you play on \u201cSound Advice?\u201d\n\nI feel like my brother and I would always say we wanted \u2015 and we did it with this \u201d[Weekend] Update\u201d writer Pete Schultz \u2015 we always wanted it to be the woman from \u201cMillionaire Matchmaker,\u201d Patti Stanger, and Zach Galifianakis from \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d That was the combo we were always trying to meet. And so once someone said that it seemed like a combo of those two, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve done our job.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Donald Trump on \u201cSNL?\u201d Do you regret working with him at all?\n\nI mean, it was just interesting. It was so weird because he could only do a certain amount of time because he\u2019s running for president. Cecily and I did the ex-porn stars thing with him and I remember he asked me like, \u201cShould I do it?\u201d and I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I wanted to do this sketch and we couldn\u2019t believe that he was gonna do it and it was just sort of surreal. We were all sort of like, \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d But also nobody thought that he was gonna win, you know? It was weird, it was crazy.\n\nDid you ever have any interaction with him in the week leading up to his appearance?\n\nNot a ton. Every week is sort of like a blur, but yeah it\u2019s just so crazy that he did that \u2015 that he was on the show. It\u2019s so weird."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michael Che Interrupts \u2018SNL\u2019 With A \u2018Glorious\u2019 Message About Butt-Cleaning", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-che-bidet_us_5c0dfd63e4b0a606a9aa1d38", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Michael Che loves his bidet... and he wants the world to know it.\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live: Weekend Update\u201d co-anchor interrupted his own segment with an ode to the best way to clean your bottom."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Immigration Is A Public Health Issue, But Not For The Reasons Some Politicians Claim", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-is-a-public-health-issue-but-not-for-the-reason-some-politicians-would-like-you-to-believe_us_5c0aadeae4b0ab8cf69307ad", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "As the United States and other global powers discuss immigrants, asylum-seekers and refugees through a purely political lens \u2015 implementing policies, physical structures, and restrictions to deter migrants from coming into their countries \u2015 global experts are urging policymakers to rethink restrictions placed on immigrants\u2019 access to health care.\n\nThat\u2019s the purpose of a report released this week by the University College London-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health \u2015 a group of 20 experts from 13 countries, including the U.S., who have spent the last two years analyzing past evidence and gathering new data on the subject.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] about positioning health within the migration debate \u2015 to make the migration agenda more human and people-centered,\u201d Dr. Mesfin Tessema, senior director of health at the International Rescue Committee, told HuffPost.\n\nTessema, who was not part of the commission, will be presenting the report\u2019s findings and recommendations to improve the public health response to migration at the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Conference on the Global Compact for Migration in Marrakech, Morocco, this weekend.\n\nContrary to stereotypes that migrants are a burden on public health services and are bringing diseases with them \u2015 a narrative that\u2019s been repeatedly perpetuated in the United States by President Donald Trump, conservative news commentators and, most recently, Fox News host Tomi Lahren while discussing the migrant caravan at the U.S.-Mexico border this week \u2015 the commission found no evidence that migrants pose a risk to public health in their new country. Instead, they were shown to be generally healthier than non-migrant populations and to contribute positively toward the nation\u2019s sustainable development.\n\nEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services.\" Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch\n\nIn the United States, specifically, research has found that immigrants payed more toward medical expenses than they withdrew, meaning they were a \u201clow-risk pool that subsidized the public and private health insurance markets,\u201d according to a Harvard Medical School and Tufts University report released in August. That same report also found that immigrants made up 12 percent of the population but only accounted for 8.6 percent of total U.S. health care spending.\n\nBut despite their contributions to the country, immigrants in the United States face significant barriers to health care. Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch, told HuffPost that legal immigrants often struggle to access health care due to a five-year delay in being able to apply for Medicaid, and because undocumented immigrants living in the United States often avoid preventive care for fear of deportation, ultimately relying on emergency health services. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health issue,\u201d she said.\n\nTerry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report and chair of Columbia University\u2019s Heilbrunn Department of Population & Family Health told HuffPost, \u201cOne interesting thing to note is that the immigrant health of Latinos, for example, often declines in the U.S. due to poor health care, health food, total lack of accessible mental health services.\u201d\n\nDespite accumulating evidence of health care needs among immigrant populations, the Trump administration continues to propose policies that could further restrict these communities\u2019 access to health services. In September, the administration proposed making it more difficult for immigrants who have enrolled for public benefits like Medicaid to either enter the U.S. or permanently stay here.\n\n\u201cEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services,\u201d McLemore said, adding that Human Rights Watch is set to release an extensive response to this proposal because \u201cit undermines all public health objectives that you can think of.\u201d\n\nMcLemore also said her organization is collecting anecdotal evidence that shows immigrants are already hesitant to enroll in public benefits programs for fear that the proposal may take effect.\n\n\u201cAll of this is going to become a serious public health problem because whenever you are denying people health services [or] reducing access to health services, you are increasing the risk to the public health,\u201d she said.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for refugees, asylum-seekers, and other displaced populations.\n\nAccording to the UCL-Lancet report, the majority of migrants that cross international borders worldwide are either students paying for their education or labor migrants who contribute to their host country\u2019s economy. A significantly smaller proportion of this population are individuals forced to leave their home countries due to persecution, conflict or disaster.\n\nHowever, this small fraction of global migrants \u2015 refugees and displaced populations, of which nearly 53 percent are children \u2015 have the highest risk of exploitation, disease and death because they usually lack access to equitable health services in their home country and initially live in cramped refugee camps or shelters with substandard health services when they first arrive in their host country.\n\nIn the United States, this narrative can be seen playing out along the U.S.-Mexico border, where asylum-seekers crossing into the country are often placed in crowded detention centers where adults and children face an increased risk of disease transmission and mental health consequences.\n\nData on immigrants detained in the United States is hard to come by, but human rights advocates have worked diligently to put together a picture of what health care for these communities look like. A Human Rights Watch report released in June had independent medical experts analyze 15 cases of immigrant deaths in detention from December 2015 to April 2017. In eight of the cases, physicians found \u201cinadequate\u201d medical care had \u201clikely\u201d contributed to the immigrants\u2019 deaths.\n\nWhile these deaths represent a fraction of the tens of thousands of immigrants in federal custody \u2015 including nearly 13,000 children, according to The New York Times \u2015 the HRW report said the fact that the deaths were due to \u201cbotched\u201d emergency responses and \u201cpoor quality of care\u201d by officers and medical staff raised serious concerns.\n\n\u201cHuman Rights Watch has documented and continues to document inadequate health care in detention and that situation is just getting worse as the numbers of those detained increase and the facilities are overcrowded and are inadequately staffed,\u201d McLemore said, adding that the UCL-Lancet report only confirms what their research has shown in the U.S. for years.\n\nMcGovern said the discrimination and restrictions that migrants and asylum seekers face in the United States because of their status leave them vulnerable to negative health outcomes. Not to mention, restricting access to preventive care could mean a higher long-term financial burden on the country.\n\nPreventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or ... putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive. Terry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report\n\n\u201cI think this report firmly establishes that preventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or separating families so that children are traumatized or putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAll of those things are just going to ultimately cause more catastrophic health problems.\u201d\n\nThe solution, as far as the UCL-Lancet commission is concerned, is for governments like the United States to implement policies that give all migrants universal and equitable health care.\n\n\u201cWhen people are excluded from health services, they don\u2019t seek care \u2015 that means that chronic diseases and other conditions go untreated or unaddressed,\u201d Tessema said. \u201cThat has long-term consequences for the individuals and for the health system overall, which has to now care for people who would have otherwise been treated earlier with simpler and more cost-effective means.\u201d\n\nMcLemore agrees: \u201cLong term, when you have people either avoiding health care or going to emergency services when they get very ill \u2015 that\u2019s the most costly kind of health care there is.\u201d\n\nBut for McGovern, it\u2019s clear that neither health costs nor public health concerns are what\u2019s currently driving U.S. immigration policy."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Humans Are Pooping Plastic, And No One\u2019s Certain How Bad That Is", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plastics-and-human-health_us_5c097d7de4b0b6cdaf5d3263", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "When Philipp Schwabl asked eight healthy people on four continents to take part in an experiment to see if plastic was present in their bodies, he had little idea what to expect.\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna researcher, who specializes in stomach disorders, asked them to keep a food diary for a week and record whether they had drunk water from plastic bottles, what brands of toothpaste and cosmetics they had used, and whether they had chewed gum. None were vegetarian, all had consumed plastic-wrapped food and most had consumed fish.\n\nThey were then asked to send a piece of their stool to an Austrian government laboratory where it was tested to identify barely visible microplastic particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters long.\n\nThe study, published in August, confirmed for the first time that microplastics are deep inside humans. All eight volunteers were found to have particles of most of the nine most common classes of plastics, including polypropylene and PET. On average, Schwabl found 20 particles per 10 grams of stool.\n\n\u201cI did not think all the samples would be positive,\u201d Schwabl said. \u201cThere is data on microplastics being present in shrimps, fish, oysters and mussels, but there was a question over whether they were present in humans. It is highly likely that during various steps of food processing or as a result of packaging, food is being contaminated with plastics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe smallest particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system and may even reach the liver,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need further research to understand what this may mean for human health.\u201d\n\nA clutch of studies looking at large plastic fragments in oceans has recently shown the world\u2019s most ubiquitous material to be present from the poles to the equator and to be a growing environmental hazard. Plastic in marine environments is now widely recognized to be a threat to many marine species.\n\nThe new awareness of plastic pollution is leading scientists to ask afresh how much the human body is being polluted.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Global plastic production has increased from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and is expected to triple by 2050.\n\nStudies have found plastic fibers and fragments present throughout the food chain, in plankton and fish larvae, bottled and tap water, seafoods, honey and salt.\n\nOne analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water. One widely sold brand had concentrations of about 10,000 particles per liter, and only 17 of the 259 bottles contained water that was free of plastic.\n\nOther research has shown plastic particles shed from degrading car tires present in the air we breathe in the street, in homes from the washing of synthetic clothes, and in the soil via sludge from water treatment works that is used as a fertilizer.\n\nWith global plastic production increasing from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and expected to triple by 2050, research is needed to gauge what effect growing human exposure to it may be having, say scientists.\n\n\u201cPlastic is non-degradable. It cannot be broken down and has the potential to persist in our bodies for a lifetime after exposure,\u201d said Stephanie Wright, a researcher at University College London who specializes in microscopic plastic pollution.\n\nConcern is growing that many man-made chemicals added to consumer plastics to give them qualities like stiffness or transparency may contain hormone-altering chemicals that have barely been tested. According to one study, detectable levels of bisphenol A, one of a group of toxic chemicals, have been found in the urine of 95 percent of the adult population of the U.S.\n\nPeople working in the textile industry have been shown to develop lung disease after exposure to nylon (plastic) flock, said Wright. \u201cContinuous daily interaction with plastic allows oral, dermal [skin] and inhalation exposure to chemical components. The potential for microplastics and nanoplastics so small they cannot be seen by the naked eye to cause harm to human health remains understudied,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Warhurst, director of European chemical watchdog group CHEM Trust, has, with academics, identified over 4,000 chemicals potentially present in plastic packaging, of which 63 have been identified as dangerous to human health because of their potential to disrupt hormones.\n\njapatino via Getty Images One analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water.\n\n\u201cMany chemicals used in plastics have not been tested for their endocrine-disrupting effects,\u201d Warhurst said. \u201cCurrent test methods are not very good at identifying all of them.\u201d\n\nSome of the most common are bisphenols and phthalates, used in everything from food packaging and toys to floor tiles and water bottles. They have been connected to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even cancers.\n\nMany countries have either banned bisphenol A or advised that it may be dangerous to children. The United States\u2019 National Toxicology Program has \u201csome concern\u201d for bisphenol A\u2019s effect on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and children. It is still used widely in Europe.\n\nBut other bisphenols and phthalates are not banned and are used frequently in the production of consumer goods. Many, said Warhurst, may be similar or even more toxic than those banned.\n\n\u201cA lot of chemicals are very similar to known endocrine disruptors. When one gets banned, there are others behind it. Chemical companies are required to provide data but it\u2019s not always comprehensive. There is no strict enforcement and companies can bring chemicals onto the market easily. More research is needed and much better control,\u201d he said.\n\nOther scientists have said the danger to human health, if any, may be in the smallest pieces, or nanoplastics. \u201cMicroplastics will not enter a cell, but nanoplastics are small enough to cross into cells and permeate the body,\u201d said Anne Marie Mahon, a researcher at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Ireland. Her recent research found sludge in water treatment works full of microparticles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that chemicals could be absorbed in our circulatory system or pass into our organs. But whether that is happening is unknown,\u201d Mahon said.\n\nIn sufficient concentrations, chemicals can injure and kill cells in the human body, said Frank Kelly, chair of environmental health at King\u2019s College London and one of Britain\u2019s leading authorities on air pollution. He wrote with Stephanie Wright: \u201cThe cells may be replaced successfully or they may not. If inhaled or ingested, microplastics may accumulate and exert localized toxicity by inducing an immune response. \u201d\n\nTheir research is backed by Philipp Schwabl in Austria. \u201cIn animals, some microparticles have been found in the liver and embedded in tissue,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on the amount, this could cause immune reactions. It\u2019s possible that the minutest particles are in the human blood and tissue but it\u2019s very hard to measure and we cannot prove it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urgently need more research,\u201d he added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture. Once those RNA packages arrive at the epididymis, the hypothesis goes, they prompt a of cascade of changes at conception that evade the stripping, or rebooting, process and the subsequent reshuffling during early development.\n\nThe critics are far from persuaded. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice work , and yes, there are changes in the testicular cells,\u201d said John M.

More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what the N.I.H. study aims to address?\n\nYes.
