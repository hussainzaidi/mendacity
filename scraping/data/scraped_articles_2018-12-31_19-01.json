But despite Trump's declarations that he's prepared to play hardball with the Democratic investigators, there's a new crew of Democrats in Washington -- rising from the party's return to the majority in the House of Representatives -- who have subpoena power and are prepared to use it.\n\n\"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

Jerry Nadler of New York dates to the 1980s, when they battled over Manhattan real estate while Nadler was in the New York State Assembly before he was elected to Congress. In his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump called Nadler \"one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.\"\n\n\"This guy wanted to put a railroad yard on the same property where I wanted to build a park and create the best middle-income housing in New York,\" Trump wrote in his book.\n\nNow Nadler is set to lead the Judiciary Committee, which would put him i n charge of any Democratic impeachment effort. His committee will also be in charge of handling a report from special counsel Robert Mueller and any fights that may arise about making it public.\n\nNadler's committee also has jurisdiction over Trump's signature issue: immigration, an area Nadler is poised to conduct rigorous oversight on -- from family separation to changes to asylum laws -- in the new Congress.\n\nNadler has said it's too soon to talk impeachment , even though there's a sizable chunk of Democratic advocates -- not to mention some House lawmakers -- who already want to move forward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nadler: Impeachable offense doesn't mean impeachment Replay More Videos ...

Schiff is expected to chair the House Intelligence Committee starting in January. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAdam Schiff\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is no stranger to Trump's Twitter tongue lashings . As the top Democrat on the Republican-led House Russia investigation in 2017 and 2018, Schiff was a constant television presence breaking down the newest revelations about Russia and Trump's team.\n\nThe President has used multiple nicknames on Twitter for the California Democrat -- Sleazy Adam Schiff, Liddle' Adam Schiff and most recently \"little Adam Schitt\" -- a sign of his prominence among Trump's Democratic critics.\n\nSchiff has accused Republicans of failing to investigate the ties between Trump's team and Russia, and he's promised to restart his committee's Russia investigation in several areas.\n\nAmong them: Schiff wants to investigate questions about Russian money laundering, to learn who Donald Trump Jr. was calling as he set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and to interview officials the committee has yet to speak to, like Michael Flynn.\n\nSchiff is a soft-spoken lawmaker, but he's shown a willingness provide headline-grabbing quotes.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first President in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time,\" Schiff said earlier this month on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal criticizes the Republican tax plan during at the US Capitol in November 2017 in Washington, DC. Neal will chair the House Ways and Means Committee in January. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRichard Neal\n\nIn the new Congress it will be Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a deal-focused Democrat, who will have the job of asking for Trump's tax returns . While modern presidential nominees have publicly released their returns, Trump has defied the norm, which Democrats argue must be remedied.\n\nUnder IRS rules, there are only three people on Capitol Hill who can ask the Treasury Department for the President's tax returns: the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal is the only Democrat.\n\nWhile Neal has said he wants to ensure that requesting the returns doesn't distract from his committee's work on infrastructure, health care and oversight of the GOP's tax bill, a source close to the process told CNN that Neal has largely given up hope that Trump will turn over his tax returns willingly, given comments from the President's allies. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN that the President would be prepared to fight in court over any formal request.\n\nThe source familiar with the process told CNN that Neal is prepared to ask the Treasury Department for the returns in the new year. When exactly he would do it is still under discussion.\n\nTrump's tax returns aren't of interest just to Neal, however. Other incoming committee chairmen have said the information within the returns could advance their own oversight.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what ... has been the sources of income for this President,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the expected chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nCummings continued, \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia, we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\"\n\nElijah Cummings\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the minority, Cummings has perhaps the broadest authority to investigate the Trump administration of any Democrat on Capitol Hill. Cummings -- even with his deep and focused voice -- is reserved, but strategic about the plans for his committee.\n\nA foil to Republican chairmen like Rep. Darrell Issa of California, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, Cummings has argued he plans to be in search of answers, not headlines -- although with his gavel, it's unlikely he will be able to avoid them.\n\nCummings has laid out a very clear path for his committee. Earlier this month, he re-sent 51 letters he'd sent while in the minority, asking the administration to comply by January 11. The letters ranged from questions about Cabinet secretary travel to immigration to security clearances to hurricane recovery efforts by the administration. But Cummings has also warned that he doesn't want his committee to only zero in on Trump's perceived failings.\n\n\"I believe that what we do in this Congress over the next year or so will have impact for the next 50 to 100 years,\" Cummings said. \"We're going to cautiously go about with subpoenas. ... There would have to be something that has a compelling interest to the citizens of the United States, and would have to be something that comes under our jurisdiction. So there's certain criteria that has to be met. I do not expect to be issuing subpoenas -- even the 64 that we've asked for because there are so many things that are backed up. And we'll never get a chance to do everything.\"\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, looks on before speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC in January. Waters will chair the House Financial Services Committee in January.\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nRep. Maxine Waters of California was pushing for impeachment back in 2017 , and she's been among the most vocal and well-known Democrats to do so. Now she'll run the Financial Services Committee, which will give her an avenue to probe the finances of Trump and the Trump Organization.\n\nThat's also made her a target for the President, who went after Waters during the 2018 campaign in tweets and at campaign rallies as a way to fire up his base. He's also attacked Waters as a \"low IQ person,\" which she has said is a racist attack.\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\" Trump tweeted in June. \"She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nWaters has made controversial statements of her own, including her call for supporters to publicly harass members of the administration in response to Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to family separations at the border.\n\nWhile in the minority, Waters pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, a lender to Trump that was separately implicated in a Russian money laundering operation in 2017. She's also pushed the Treasury Department to divulge financial ties between Russia and the Trump family.\n\nThe jurisdiction of Waters' committee makes it likely she'll clash with Trump in a way that particularly hits home for him: his finances."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "House Dems hiring lawyers for potential probes", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/vIJAMpYWqJk/house-democrats-investigations-lawyers-hiring-mattingly-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "A recent committee job posting reviewed by CNN asked for legislative counsels with a variety of expertise, indicating House Democrats are looking to hire a batch of attorneys as they prepare for what may be the largest congressional investigation of a sitting president in modern history."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Report: Russians pressured Manafort during Trump campaign", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/XcesZwobBvs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Paul Manafort was pressured by a former Russian associate to pay back millions he owed during the time he was running Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new report from Time magazine.\n\nFormer Russian intelligence officer Victor Boyarkin was in touch with Manafort during the 2016 US presidential campaign on behalf of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has close ties to the Kremlin, the magazine reported Saturday.\n\nBoyarkin told Time magazine that he contacted Manafort to collect the debt he owed to Deripaska.\n\n\"He owed us a lot of money,\" Boyarkin told Time this past fall. \"And he was offering ways to pay it back.\"\n\n\"I came down on him hard,\" Boyarkin added.\n\n, his former business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, to brief Deripaska on the 2016 presidential race, Less than two weeks before Trump accepted the Republican nomination, Manafort offered in emails to a middlemanhis former business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, to brief Deripaska on the 2016 presidential race, The Washington Post and The Atlantic reported last year. In the emails, Kilimnik wrote to Manafort about an associate \"our friend V\" with ties to Deripaska, The Atlantic reported. According to Time, Boyarkin was the \"friend.\"\n\nFormer Russian intelligence officer Victor Boyarkin\n\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment to CNN on Time's report.\n\nThe alleged connection shows the leverage that powerful Russians had over Manafort at the time he was Trump's campaign chair between May and August of 2016, Time noted. Boyarkin also told Time that he has been approached by special counsel Robert Mueller's office, which is investigating ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia, but he told investigators \"to go dig a ditch.\"\n\nSpecial counsel spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment to Time.\n\nBoth Boyarkin and Deripaska, meanwhile, have been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department.\n\nIn its December 19 announcement of new Russia sanctions, the Treasury Department referred to Boyarkin as \"a former GRU officer who reports directly to Deripaska and has led business negotiations on Deripaska's behalf.\" The GRU is Russia's military intelligence agency.\n\nDeripaska was sanctioned earlier this year as part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to punish the Kremlin over interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDeripaska connection\n\nManafort worked for Deripaska about a decade ago, providing investment and consulting services to the Russian billionaire, according to both men.\n\nBut in 2014, lawyers for Deripaska filed a petition in a Cayman Islands court accusing Manafort of having \"simply disappeared\" with about $19 million of his money, Time reported. In a lawsuit earlier this year , Deripaska also accused Manafort and others of \"vanishing\" $26 million he gave them a decade ago. The lawsuit, which Deripaska filed in New York state following Manafort's indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller, is now paused because of the criminal matter.\n\nBoyarkin told Time that his connection to Manafort dates back to 2006. Manafort had a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska that began in 2006, the Associated Press reported last year , citing several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. The contract came after Manafort pitched a confidential proposal to Deripaska \"that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit (Russian) President Vladimir Putin's government,\" the AP reported.\n\nManafort told AP at the time that the contract was not pro-Russian in nature, and a representative of Deripaska told the news organization that the contract was for \"investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr. Deripaska.\"\n\nManafort was found guilty in August of eight counts of financial crimes, including tax fraud, bank fraud, and hiding foreign bank accounts. He pleaded guilty in September to one count of conspiracy against the US and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department.\n\nBut earlier this month , Mueller accused Manafort of lying about several issues after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, including his \"contact with administration officials\" --- violating his plea agreement.\n\nManafort is scheduled to receive his first sentence, for the eight financial convictions decided by a Virginia jury, in early February.\n\nHis second sentencing date, before the judge who's handling the breach of his plea agreement, is tentatively set for early March."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Graham to CNN's Dana Bash: That's a bunch of bulls***", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/KDV7Y53ezW4/lindsey-graham-obama-iraq-war-strategy-trump-syria-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Few American presidents ever have experienced as much legal turmoil in one year as Donald Trump did in 2018. The past year brought a drumbeat of blockbuster revelations from special counsel Robert Mueller, but 2018 could end up as just a brisk warmup for what's to come in 2019. Buckle up.\n\nAs a reminder of just how much has changed, here's what the landscape looked like one year ago today:\n\n-- Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort was a free man who had been charged but not convicted of any crime. Now he is a convicted felon who has been in federal prison for six months, and might stay there for the rest of his life.\n\n-- No Russians had been charged with any crime relating to the 2016 election. Since then, Mueller has charged 13 Russian national s for allegedly using social media to conduct \"information warfare against the United States\" and 12 Russian intelligence officers for allegedly hacking the servers of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and others in an effort to help Trump win the 2016 election.\n\n-- Jeff Session s was attorney general and Don McGahn was White House counsel and the Republicans had a stranglehold on both houses of Congress.\n\nMueller is far from done. 2019 promises to be another cataclysmic year for Trump and his inner circle. Keeping in mind an immutable truth of this investigation -- Mueller knows more than we do -- here's a look ahead at what to expect.\n\nSentencings\n\nSeveral former members of the Trump campaign and administration soon will learn how long they will spend behind bars.\n\nMichael Flynn. Flynn likely walked into court for sentencing in December expecting to leave a free man; --Flynn likely walked into court for sentencing in December expecting to leave a free man; Flynn's own lawyers and Mueller agreed that he deserved a non-incarceratory sentence, given his substantial cooperation with prosecutors. Not so fast. Judge Emmet Sullivan laid into Flynn, rejecting the suggestion that Flynn had been set up by the FBI and wondering aloud if he might have committed treason. Flynn now faces an uncertain future. Judge Sullivan gave Flynn until March 13, 2019 to update the court on his cooperation. The message to Flynn is clear: either prove your worth to Mueller, or you're going to jail.\n\nWho's under scrutiny now\n\nJUST WATCHED Rep.

Incoming House committee chairs, including Adam Schiff (Intelligence), Jerry Nadler (Judiciary), Elijah Cummings (Oversight and Government Reform) and others, made no effort to play it cool, publicly announcing their planned Trump-centric investigations the day after midterms, even before all election results had been tallied.\n\nThese House investigations would open up a new front, with different rules, for Trump. While Mueller carries plenty of punch, much of his work is done out of public view and subject to strict rules of grand jury secrecy and criminal procedure. The House, however, can hold public hearings, on fairly short notice, with little limitation on substance . The Democrats' hit list includes Russian election interference (though they would be well-advised to steer clear of Mueller's ongoing criminal probe ), Trump's tax returns and personal finances, payments of hush money and the appointment of Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nJUST WATCHED Schiff may try to force Mueller report release Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schiff may try to force Mueller report release 01:26\n\nWhile House Democrats now wield a powerful new tool, don't expect the White House to accede to every demand from Schiff and company. Trump and his legal team could take various tacks , ranging from challenging the scope and relevance of congressional subpoenas to invoking executive privilege to simply defying Congress. This will not go down without a legal battle.\n\nThe Mueller report\n\nThe special counsel regulations set out a two-step process for Mueller's final report. First, Mueller must \"provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel.\" The attorney general, in turn, may decide whether and how to release the information in the report, or some portion of it, to Congress and the public.\n\nFurther complicating matters is uncertainty about who will be attorney general by the time Mueller issues his report, and whether that person -- Whitaker or Trump's announced nominee, William Barr -- will allow the report to see the light of day.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump lashed out at Whitaker after Cohen news Replay More Videos ...

In it, Kim said he regretted not being able to visit Seoul in 2018 but expressed a strong will to travel to the South Korean capital in the future.\n\nFew expect Kim to rock the boat dramatically in Tuesday's speech. Many believe the young leader holds some of the best cards of all the geopolitical players with a stake in the future of the Korean Peninsula. Most do not expect Kim to risk his standing in a speech that's largely intended for a domestic audience.\n\n\"He's got the United States and South Korea where they want them right now,\" said Evans Revere, a former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and current senior director with the Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nNorth Korea's diplomatic achievements in 2018 would have been unthinkable a year earlier. In the lead up to Kim's 2018 New Year's speech, Pyongyang had tested its most advanced long-range missile to date and its most powerful nuclear bomb, after months of similar weapons tests and saber-rattling between North Korea and the US.\n\nFew would have predicted that the following year, Kim would meet Moon three times, leave his country for the first time since taking power in 2011 and become the first North Korean leader to sit face to face with a sitting US President.\n\nJUST WATCHED South Korean train heads North for first time in decade Replay More Videos ...

The two leaders agreed to start rebuilding the bilateral relationship and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. In terms of nuclear weapons, North Korea committed \"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" a vague term that experts say Washington and Pyongyang interpret differently.\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea expert says nuclear threat remains Replay More Videos ...

North Korea has not agreed to any timeline to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nor has it committed itself to declaring its weaponry and key weapons facilities -- steps that experts say are crucial in any disarmament talks.\n\nExperts will be watching for any mention of the nuclear program in next year's speech, especially if it strikes the defiant tone of this year's address -- when Kim declared that \"no force and nothing\" could reverse the gains his country had made in nuclear weapons development.\n\n\"He said that this January, but he's engaged in this diplomatic process with the US,\" said Duyeon Kim, a adjunct fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see how Pyongyang negotiates going forward because Kim Jong Un claimed this year that nobody could reverse their nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nEconomics\n\nClues about what Pyongyang sees as the speech's key passages often come in the form of rhetorical devices, such as when Kim switches to a first-person voice, according to John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Affairs in Seoul.\n\nDelury said he'll watch closely for comments about the country's economic development, something likely to be highly scrutinized inside North Korea and which could prove to be the most important part of the speech.\n\nIn the 2018 speech, Kim acknowledged that the moribund economy was in need of a boost and committed himself to improving it. However North Korea does not make its economic statistics available internationally, making it difficult to precisely track its economic performance and determine what proportion of its population works in more modern fields.\n\nJust days before his first summit with Moon in April , Kim took the drastic step of declaring that North Korea had successfully completed its nuclear weapons program and would suspend nuclear and missile tests. It would now solely focus on effort to \"dramatically raise people's lives\" by developing a \"strong socialist economy.\"\n\nThe two-pronged strategy of nuclear and economic development, known as \"byungjin,\" had been in place since shortly after Kim took the reins from his father in 2011. Abandoning it represented a significant policy shift.\n\nHowever, the regime has yet to articulate a coherent vision or plan with respect to development.\n\n\"There's some pressure in this year's New Year's speech to articulate a vision of a real focus on economic development,\" Delury said.\n\n\"How does Kim Jong Un reflect this strategic shift to economic development?\"\n\nIn recent months, North Korean state media has focused heavily on economic issues, often touting the importance that people inside the country work vigorously to increase production.\n\nBut that hardly constitutes a plan. Investors see North Korea as a land ripe with opportunities, and they're looking for a strategy that would allow for infrastructure investments connecting South Korea to Russia by rail or opening up North Korea's relatively well-educated, low-wage workforce to manufacturers from the region.\n\nAll of that, however, is off-limits at the moment due to the sanctions levied on Pyongyang as punishment for its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd Delury says it's unlikely for Kim to come out and just announce a detailed strategic shift.

Beijing has begun pushing for a greater stake in the region with a view to opening new trade routes, exploring for oil and gas and conducting research on climate change, experts say.\n\nGeographically, China is nowhere near the Arctic Circle, which puts the Asian powerhouse at a major political disadvantage compared to eight countries that make up the Arctic Council, all of whom have territory inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nCouncil members are divided on China's growing interest in the region. Some smaller economies like Iceland and Norway see an opportunity, others with a strategic interest like Russia and Canada are growing wary.\n\nChina isn't the only non-Arctic state interested in the region but it is by far the biggest, China and polar region expert Marc Lanteigne of Massey University in New Zealand told CNN.\n\nIn 2013 it joined India, South Korea, Japan and Singapore in gaining non-voting observer status on the Council.\n\n\"Overall, there's been the acceptance that China is going to be a player there, but there is still some concern about the ambiguity to what China's endgame is,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nArctic Council foreign ministers with then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on May 11, 2017.\n\nPolar silk road\n\nIn January, Beijing published its first Arctic strategy white paper, claiming a vested interest in the region while attempting to allay fears over its territorial ambitions.\n\nIt defines itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in the document, saying environmental changes in the Arctic have a \"direct impact on China's climate system and ecological environment.\"\n\nThe white paper details Beijing's plans for a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure program, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping whose government has spent big to build vast trade corridors across the world.\n\nWhile the Belt and Road initiative has drawn criticism in the West due to concerns that China is ensnaring developing countries in debt, Lanteigne says it's welcomed by some of the smaller Arctic players keen on building economic ties with Beijing.\n\n\"It has excited quite a few of the Nordic states who see the possibility of expanded Chinese sea traffic and potentially new ports,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nThe idea of a mutually beneficial partnership is exactly the reassuring message China sought to drive home in its Arctic policy, with repeated references to \"cooperation.\"\n\nMelting sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast on March 30, 2017 above Greenland.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to Arctic Council concerns before China's admission, when members feared it could seek to repeat its South China Sea territorial grab in the Arctic Circle.\n\nBeijing claims an enormous swath of territory in the South China Sea, and has created heavily fortified artificial islands to help assert its position in the Spratly and Paracel island chains.\n\nIn comparison, the situation in the Arctic is relatively peaceful, according to experts, with no serious territorial disputes. And the Arctic states are eager to keep it that way.\n\n'Brimming with economic potential'\n\nBeijing claims the main reason for its interest in the Arctic is scientific research.\n\nIn the white paper, it detailed a desire to investigate the effects of climate change to \"resolve global environmental issues.\"\n\nBut skeptics have argued that China's Arctic ambitions are largely fueled by the economic and political appeal of dominating a resource-rich area.\n\nIt is estimated that the Arctic may hold nearly one-third of the world's natural gas and 13% of global oil reserves, according to a report by Rachael Gosnell at the University of Maryland.\n\nAnd as rising temperatures melt the region's ice, shipping routes that were once impassible are now an attractive and feasible alternative for the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The Arctic is brimming with economic potential,\" said Gosnell, who estimates that the annual economy of the region exceeds $450 billion.\n\nAccording to NASA, some global climate models predict the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months by the middle of this century, likely making its waters an important shipping route.\n\n\"China really wants to put itself in a position whereby, should there be some kind of scramble or push for Arctic resources, China would be very well placed to take advantage of that,\" said Lanteigne, the polar region expert.\n\nTo secure that position, it is strengthening its Arctic capabilities. In September, China launched a second icebreaker known as Xue Long 2, or Snow Dragon 2, with an expedition scheduled for the first half of 2019, according to state-run media.\n\nThe newly minted vessel is the first Chinese-built icebreaker. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation claims it will be more capable of cutting through ice and carrying out advanced research than its foreign-built predecessor.\n\nChina's first domestically-built icebreaker, Xuelong 2, during a launch ceremony at a shipyard in Shanghai in September.\n\nWashington's loss, Beijing's gain\n\nChina has been quick to recognize the importance of investing in the Arctic at a time when there are few participants and even fewer laws, so that it can eventually restructure Arctic governance in its favor, said Harriet Moynihan, associate fellow at the UK think tank Chatham House.\n\nChina's increasing involvement in the Arctic Circle has also coincided with a growing lack of interest from Washington.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to eliminate a special envoy and representative for the Arctic region in 2017, as climate change dropped down the list of priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet. In 2018 only two functioning icebreakers remain, one of which is a heavy-duty vessel overdue for an update.\n\nThe Obama administration pursued an ambitious Arctic strategy to ensure the US remained a strong power in regional affairs, including plans to replace the heavy icebreaker by 2020.\n\nBut it's unclear where the US now stands on those plans. The US Coast Guard, which runs the icebreakers, faces significant budget cuts as more and more funding is reconsidered for border security.\n\n\"Because of the fact that the Arctic is not a priority for the Trump government, this has allowed China to take the steering wheel and accelerate their own Arctic policies,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nRussia is arguably the most active Arctic state, with a fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, and it is reluctant to allow non-Arctic countries to develop the region.\n\nBut facing mounting Western sanctions, Moscow's attitude toward China has warmed considerably. \"Russia realized that China was one of the few countries left that could really help with Siberian development,\" Lanteigne said.\n\n\"The two countries have cooperated in a number of Arctic ventures, including a liquefied natural gas project.\"\n\nWith large parts of the Arctic still difficult for China to reach, it remains less important to Beijing than investments in other parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia.\n\nBut China's presence in the far north is only likely to grow -- whether the Arctic states are pleased about it or not."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'50-50' chance Brexit won't happen, says senior minister", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/qGBad1OBC2A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) A senior UK government minister has warned there is a \"50-50\" chance Brexit won't happen, if Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is voted down in Parliament next month.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter, told the Sunday Times that the only way to be \"100% certain\" Britain will leave the European Union is if ministers back the deal.\n\nThe UK is scheduled to exit the bloc on March 29 next year.

The team gathered data on how each of those groups do across indicators like hate crimes, political representation, anti-discrimination laws, income inequality, incarceration rates and immigration and asylum policies.\n\nThey then compiled each group's performance on those indicators into a final score. Here's what they found:\n\nThe US lags far behind global leaders in inclusiveness\n\nIn 2016, the United States was one of the most inclusive countries in the world, ranking 23rd. In 2017, that ranking dropped to 69th.\n\nThe US has improved some since 2017, and it's now the 58th most inclusive country, according to the Haas Institute's index.\n\nThat still puts it in the medium category though, ranking behind countries like the Philippines, Poland and Nicaragua, but ahead of countries like Nigeria, Israel and India.\n\nThe biggest reason the US is consistently ranked as less inclusive than countries like the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom is the number of people in the US held in prisons and jails, said Stephen Menendian, an author of the report and assistant director of the Haas Institute.\n\nThe US has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. For every 100,000 people in the US, approximately 655 of them were behind bars, according to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nAnother factor dragging the US down is the Trump administration's refugee and immigration policies, according to the Haas Institute's report.\n\n\"It shouldn't be surprising for people who are paying attention to the headlines,\" said Menendian.\n\nSince President Trump took office, his administration has dramatically scaled back the number of refugees admitted by the US, even as the number of people displaced by war and famine surges across the world\n\nIn 2019, the US will cap refugee admissions at 30,000, the lowest level since 1980. The new cap is even lower than the record low 45,000 cap in 2018.\n\nTo put that number into context, the Obama administration set the cap at 110,000 refugees for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\n\"The country is rolling up the welcome mat and that's reflected in the data in our index,\" Menendian said.\n\nThe situation differs state by state\n\nIf you expected to see liberal, coastal states at the top of the inclusiveness list, the rankings might surprise you.\n\nStates like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut didn't make the top 10, while California only ranked number five.\n\nThe most inclusive state in the US is actually Hawaii, followed by Nevada, Maryland, Vermont and California, according to the Haas Institute's index. At the bottom of the list are Louisiana, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi.\n\nHawaii's no. 1 ranking has a lot to do with its racial diversity.\n\nSeventy-five percent of people in Hawaii are non-white or biracial . Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard, the state's representatives in the US House, are both women of color, and Sen. Mazie Hirono is of Japanese descent. It also has the country's highest percentage of nonwhite state legislators.\n\n\"If you think about Hawaii, which has a very multiethnic population, I'd say that the report accurately captures the degree to which people of various different ethnic origins are participating in the economy,\" said Camille Busette, a senior fellow for the Brookings Institution. \"That suggests inclusivity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the five least inclusive states have all enacted anti-Sharia laws , an indicator that the Haas Institute used to predict discrimination against all religious minorities.\n\nThe Haas Institute illustrated how inclusiveness changes from state to state through a number of real-world examples, including access to clean water and sewage services; gender-equality laws; and the enforcement of controversial immigration laws, such as family separations.\n\nStill, it's not all bad\n\nThe report's findings may seem grim, but the situation isn't hopeless.\n\nIn 2018, more states (12) became more inclusive than became less inclusive (11). Meanwhile, 27 stayed the same.\n\nMenendian said the US ranks in the middle on political representation of minorities, and the 2018 data doesn't take into account the results of the midterm elections.\n\nThe report also isn't all encompassing. Busette points out that the Haas Institute didn't touch on other important markers of exclusivity, such as food insecurity.\n\n\"Internationally, we know that food insecurity has been a problem, but in the US, food insecurity is also a problem and depending on where you are, it's more of a problem than not,\" she said.\n\nBusette added that inclusiveness is probably best measured at the neighborhood level. But she said the index could offer a more holistic picture of how inclusive states are if it also took into account factors like housing insecurity, healthcare insecurity and wealth disparity.\n\n\"The report focuses on income disparities, but not wealth disparities,\" she said. \"Wealth disparities tell you about the historical legacy of the lack of inclusion, the multi-generational policies that make it difficult for a particular group to generate wealth.\"\n\nMenendian cautioned that the index shouldn't be viewed as the end-all-be-all on how inclusive a country or state is.\n\n\"Our index is a good diagnostic instrument for trying to get a sense of how countries are faring and how states are faring against each other, but it's not the final word on these issues,\" he said.\n\nLastly, the report doesn't account for recent political developments that would presumably benefit a country's inclusiveness ranking."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "From paychecks to pups: Get ready for new laws in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/b4HCliszX6E/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) When the New Year's confetti comes down at midnight, so will a wave of new laws across the country.\n\nFrom jury duty to pet purchases, here's a look at some of the changes for 2019:\n\nMinimum wages will get a boost\n\nAt least 19 states will increase their minimum wages on or around New Year's Day, according to the National Employment Law Project\n\nThe group's executive director, Christine Owens, said the increases come after years of frustration by hard-working, lower-income Americans.\n\n\"Working people are struggling to pay their bills, but they see that it's the corporations and the wealthy CEOs who are getting the tax breaks.

Jerry Nadler of New York dates to the 1980s, when they battled over Manhattan real estate while Nadler was in the New York State Assembly before he was elected to Congress. In his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump called Nadler \"one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.\"\n\n\"This guy wanted to put a railroad yard on the same property where I wanted to build a park and create the best middle-income housing in New York,\" Trump wrote in his book.\n\nNow Nadler is set to lead the Judiciary Committee, which would put him i n charge of any Democratic impeachment effort. His committee will also be in charge of handling a report from special counsel Robert Mueller and any fights that may arise about making it public.\n\nNadler's committee also has jurisdiction over Trump's signature issue: immigration, an area Nadler is poised to conduct rigorous oversight on -- from family separation to changes to asylum laws -- in the new Congress.\n\nNadler has said it's too soon to talk impeachment , even though there's a sizable chunk of Democratic advocates -- not to mention some House lawmakers -- who already want to move forward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nadler: Impeachable offense doesn't mean impeachment Replay More Videos ...

Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is no stranger to Trump's Twitter tongue lashings . As the top Democrat on the Republican-led House Russia investigation in 2017 and 2018, Schiff was a constant television presence breaking down the newest revelations about Russia and Trump's team.\n\nThe President has used multiple nicknames on Twitter for the California Democrat -- Sleazy Adam Schiff, Liddle' Adam Schiff and most recently \"little Adam Schitt\" -- a sign of his prominence among Trump's Democratic critics.\n\nSchiff has accused Republicans of failing to investigate the ties between Trump's team and Russia, and he's promised to restart his committee's Russia investigation in several areas.\n\nAmong them: Schiff wants to investigate questions about Russian money laundering, to learn who Donald Trump Jr. was calling as he set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and to interview officials the committee has yet to speak to, like Michael Flynn.\n\nSchiff is a soft-spoken lawmaker, but he's shown a willingness provide headline-grabbing quotes.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first President in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time,\" Schiff said earlier this month on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal criticizes the Republican tax plan during at the US Capitol in November 2017 in Washington, DC. Neal will chair the House Ways and Means Committee in January. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRichard Neal\n\nIn the new Congress it will be Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a deal-focused Democrat, who will have the job of asking for Trump's tax returns . While modern presidential nominees have publicly released their returns, Trump has defied the norm, which Democrats argue must be remedied.\n\nUnder IRS rules, there are only three people on Capitol Hill who can ask the Treasury Department for the President's tax returns: the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal is the only Democrat.\n\nWhile Neal has said he wants to ensure that requesting the returns doesn't distract from his committee's work on infrastructure, health care and oversight of the GOP's tax bill, a source close to the process told CNN that Neal has largely given up hope that Trump will turn over his tax returns willingly, given comments from the President's allies. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN that the President would be prepared to fight in court over any formal request.\n\nThe source familiar with the process told CNN that Neal is prepared to ask the Treasury Department for the returns in the new year. When exactly he would do it is still under discussion.\n\nTrump's tax returns aren't of interest just to Neal, however. Other incoming committee chairmen have said the information within the returns could advance their own oversight.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what ... has been the sources of income for this President,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the expected chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nCummings continued, \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia, we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\"\n\nElijah Cummings\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the minority, Cummings has perhaps the broadest authority to investigate the Trump administration of any Democrat on Capitol Hill. Cummings -- even with his deep and focused voice -- is reserved, but strategic about the plans for his committee.\n\nA foil to Republican chairmen like Rep. Darrell Issa of California, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, Cummings has argued he plans to be in search of answers, not headlines -- although with his gavel, it's unlikely he will be able to avoid them.\n\nCummings has laid out a very clear path for his committee. Earlier this month, he re-sent 51 letters he'd sent while in the minority, asking the administration to comply by January 11. The letters ranged from questions about Cabinet secretary travel to immigration to security clearances to hurricane recovery efforts by the administration. But Cummings has also warned that he doesn't want his committee to only zero in on Trump's perceived failings.\n\n\"I believe that what we do in this Congress over the next year or so will have impact for the next 50 to 100 years,\" Cummings said. \"We're going to cautiously go about with subpoenas. ... There would have to be something that has a compelling interest to the citizens of the United States, and would have to be something that comes under our jurisdiction. So there's certain criteria that has to be met. I do not expect to be issuing subpoenas -- even the 64 that we've asked for because there are so many things that are backed up. And we'll never get a chance to do everything.\"\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, looks on before speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC in January. Waters will chair the House Financial Services Committee in January.\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nRep. Maxine Waters of California was pushing for impeachment back in 2017 , and she's been among the most vocal and well-known Democrats to do so. Now she'll run the Financial Services Committee, which will give her an avenue to probe the finances of Trump and the Trump Organization.\n\nThat's also made her a target for the President, who went after Waters during the 2018 campaign in tweets and at campaign rallies as a way to fire up his base. He's also attacked Waters as a \"low IQ person,\" which she has said is a racist attack.\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\" Trump tweeted in June. \"She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nWaters has made controversial statements of her own, including her call for supporters to publicly harass members of the administration in response to Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to family separations at the border.\n\nWhile in the minority, Waters pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, a lender to Trump that was separately implicated in a Russian money laundering operation in 2017. She's also pushed the Treasury Department to divulge financial ties between Russia and the Trump family.\n\nThe jurisdiction of Waters' committee makes it likely she'll clash with Trump in a way that particularly hits home for him: his finances."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump issues executive order freezing federal workers' pay in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/6A5_2So5CAU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump issued an executive order Friday freezing federal workers' pay for 2019, following through on a proposal he announced earlier in the year.\n\nThe move, which nixes a 2.1% across-the-board pay raise that was set to take effect in January, comes as hundreds of thousands of federal employees are expecting to begin the new year furloughed or working without pay because of a partial government shutdown.\n\nTrump told lawmakers he planned to scrap the 2019 pay bump for federal workers in August, saying the federal budget couldn't support it.

After a two-hour lunch with Trump, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters the President had not committed to a resolution but Graham was hopeful a compromise could be reached in the coming days.\n\n\"(The) President didn't commit but I think he's very open minded,\" the South Carolina legislator said after their lunch.\n\nGraham proposed providing $5 billion for border security \"in areas that make sense\" in exchange for legislative changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and immigrants with temporary protected status. Graham said Trump called the idea \"interesting.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Democrats have any interest in Graham's proposal, and none voiced support for it publicly Sunday.\n\nBut even as Trump signals willingness to hear ideas from his allies on Capitol Hill, officials and allies close to the President said it is still not clear what he would sign. Asked on Sunday if the President will sign or veto a bill that Democrats pass, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that \"it depends what's in it,\" but added that Trump is \"ready to negotiate.\" As far as the type of border security Trump is looking to get funded in a deal goes, Conway did not offer specifics, but told Bash that \"it's anything -- it's all of the above.\"\n\nRepublican Sen.

Chuck Schumer last Saturday night that included more than $1.3 billion but less than the $5 billion Trump initially wanted. A White House official said Schumer did not immediately reject the proposal of $2.5 billion, but during a call this week, Schumer informed the White House that Democrats do not expect to accept or counteroffer the White House's proposal, according to a second official. A Schumer spokesperson said Thursday that the White House and Democrats were \"still very far apart,\" but the spokesperson said Schumer made it clear at the time of last Saturday's meeting that Democrats would not accept the offer.\n\nAs the President has continued to watch television coverage of the shutdown and phone allies in recent days, he has told them he will not give up his signature campaign promise. But there are now questions about whether or not he will follow through on his promise to supporters to build a concrete wall. During her appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Conway repeatedly referred to it as \"border security\" and not a wall. And Trump's outgoing chief of staff John Kelly, who has been largely uninvolved in the shutdown negotiations, said in an interview published Sunday that the wall Trump is hammering Democrats over is not actually a concrete wall and hasn't been since the early days of the administration.\n\n\"To be honest, it's not a wall,\" Kelly told the Los Angeles Times. \"The president still says 'wall' \u2014 oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats.

It's legal to sell to anyone,\" he said.\n\nYet in recent years, more attention has turned to how much alcohol young people are drinking, not necessarily the age at which drinking starts.\n\nResearch suggests that the greater economic wealth a country has , the more alcohol is consumed and the higher the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking.\n\nWhere teen drinking is highest and lowest\n\nBinge or heavy episodic drinking can be measured as consuming at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. Worldwide, about 16% of drinkers 15 and older engage in heavy episodic drinking, according to WHO.\n\n\"Ten grams of alcohol is a standard drink , which is approximately almost a bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a standard drink of spirits,\" Rekve said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a standard drink as equal to 14 grams of pure alcohol.\n\nIn 2016, the country with the highest percentage of 15- to 19-year-olds reporting heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days was Luxembourg, with 54%, according to WHO. Equatorial Guinea followed with 53.7% and then Lithuania with 53.2%.\n\nNo other countries had more than half of teens in that age group report heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days.\n\nCountries where no 15- to 19-year-olds reported heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days were Mauritania, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"Europe usually is really high, both for the adult population and for 15- to 19-year-olds,\" Rekve said. More than one-fifth of the European population 15 and older has reported heavy episodic drinking at least once a week, according to WHO.\n\nHe added, however, that many European countries have recently seen a drop in alcohol use that mirrors the number of adolescents abstaining from drinking altogether.\n\nOne study, published in the journal BMC Public Health in October, found that 29% of 16- to 24-year-olds in England were non-drinkers in 2015, up from 18% in 2005.\n\nWHO report published in September found that, across 15 European countries and regions, more than 1 in 5 15-year-old girls reported weekly drinking in 2002, with the highest prevalence in England, Scotland, Malta and Denmark. But by 2014, only Malta had a prevalence greater than 20%.\n\nAmong 15-year-old boys, more than 1 in 5 reported weekly drinking across 24 European countries and regions, with the highest prevalence in Malta, Denmark, England, and Wales. But by 2014, only nine countries and regions had a prevalence greater than 20%, with the highest prevalence in Croatia, Malta, and Italy, according to the report.\n\nIn the United States, rates of binge drinking among teenagers also have been on the decline.\n\nThose percentages were down from 2013, when it was reported by 10.2%, 25.7% and 39.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the report.\n\nOverall, the percentage of teenagers in America who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases,\" she said\n\nHow heavy drinking can affect young people's health\n\nStudies have varied, but some researchers say no amount of alcohol is good for your health, and binge drinking can damage the body and brain, especially in a young person.

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open . During that 18-year span, the mortality rate for youth due to opioid poisoningsnearly tripled.\n\n\"What began more than 2 decades ago as a public health problem primarily among young and middle-aged white males is now an epidemic of prescription and illicit opioid abuse that is taking a toll on all segments of US society, including the pediatric population,\" researchers wrote. \"Millions of children and adolescents are now routinely exposed in their homes, schools and communities to these potent and addictive drugs.\"\n\nResearch released earlier this year in the journal Pediatrics showed that the number of children admitted to hospitals for opioid overdoses nearly doubled from 2004 to 2015.\n\nThis new study set out to examine who's dying.\n\nLooking at the numbers\n\nOf the 8,986 children and adolescents who died from opioid poisonings over the 18-year period, 6,567 (about 73%) were male and 7,921 (about 88%) were adolescents ranging in age from 15 to 19. Among the 15- to 19-year-olds, 3,050 deaths also involved one or more other substances, such as benzodiazepines, cocaine, alcohol or antidepressants.\n\nNearly 7% of deaths were children ages zero to 4, about 4% were 10 to 14 and about 1% were ages 5 to 9.\n\nNon-Hispanic white children and adolescents made up the majority, nearly 80%, of those who died. Hispanic youth accounted for more than 10% of the deaths, while non-Hispanic black youth were about 7% of the death total.\n\nPrescription opioids accounted for 73% of the deaths, but heroin killed nearly 1,900 (about 24%) of those age 15 to 19.\n\nThe bulk of these opioid deaths, nearly 81% of them, were unintentional. Five percent were suicides and 2.4% were homicides. But for children younger than 5, nearly a quarter of the deaths were labeled homicides; among infants, it was closer to 35%.\n\nThe importance of place\n\nWhere children and adolescents died was also examined, since most other research has focused on results from emergency room visits and hospitalizations, the researchers said.\n\nThey pointed to one study that determined that about 2,000 children a year were hospitalized for opioid poisoning between 1997 and 2012, and \"a small number,\" about 30 each year, died while hospitalized.\n\nThe new report, however, puts the number of deaths per year at closer to 500.

And Ultima is further out in space even than the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nHal Weaver, the JHU-APL project scientist on the mission, said the diminutive body was \"probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early Solar System\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New Horizons' chief scientist Alan Stern: \"It's pure science and pure exploration\"\n\nNew Horizons has been taking hundred of pictures of its quarry on approach. And although Ultima has appeared only as a faint dot in these images, the information gleaned from them has been critical in helping the mission team develop the navigation model that will be used to guide the probe through its encounter.\n\nBut they have also thrown up something of a puzzle: the light reflected off the object is much flatter than expected for a body that is anticipated to be irregular in shape and rotating.\n\nSeveral explanations for the lack of variation in the \"light curve\" have been proposed. One could simply be the geometry of the viewing angle; another is that Ultima is actually two or more objects moving about each other.\n\nThis latter possibility has long been a topic of speculation.\n\nWhy is New Horizons visiting Ultima Thule?\n\nNasa wanted to explore something beyond Pluto and this object was reachable.\n\nRemarkably, it was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nIt's a Latin phrase that means something like \"a place beyond the known world\".\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its size, it is likely to be composed of a lot of ice, dust and maybe some larger rock fragments, which came together at the dawn of the Solar System.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobate form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nDistant telescopic observations suggested its surface is very dark, with a bit of a red tinge. That darkness (it reflects only about 10% of the light falling on its surface) is the result of having been \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, rotation, composition and environment.\n\nScientists want to know how these far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the final hours of the flyby.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed. Features as small as 33m across should be discernible if the pointing of the cameras is spot on.\n\nBecause New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nThe \"hey, I'm healthy and I've got a treasure trove of data\" message should be picked up by Nasa's network of big radio dishes at 15:28 GMT.\n\nImage copyright NASA / JHUAPL / SWRI Image caption The detail in the highest resolution pictures should be better than New Horizons achieved at Pluto\n\nJust how big a challenge is this flyby?\n\nIn some ways, this event is more difficult than the pass of Pluto.\n\nThe object in the viewfinder is almost a hundred times smaller.\n\nNew Horizons will get closer than it did to Pluto, which is good for image detail; but it means that if the pointing is off, the probe could be sending back pictures of empty space.\n\nAnd this really is a major concern. Because Ultima was only discovered four years ago, its position and movement on the sky are much more uncertain than the coordinates for Pluto.\n\nHence the importance of the final timing commands uploaded to the spacecraft on Sunday.\n\nAnd, remember, all this is being done at a distance of 6.62 billion km (4.11 billion miles) from Earth.\n\nAt that separation, radio signals take six hours and eight minutes to reach home.\n\nWhat is more, the data rates are glacial - around 1,000 bits a second.\n\nIt will be late on Tuesday before the first of a few choice images in downlinked, and it will be September 2020 until every last scrap of data from the flyby is pulled off New Horizons.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mother of the Hubble: Tributes paid to Nasa scientist", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46720014", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Roman had a lifelong fascination with the stars\n\nTributes are being paid to Dr Nancy Grace Roman, the first woman to hold an executive position at the US space agency Nasa.\n\nDr Roman was known as \"Mother of the Hubble\" for her work on the early stages of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nNasa said her most important legacy was the advancement of women in the sciences and the generations of young scientists she inspired.\n\nShe died in Maryland on Wednesday at the age of 93.\n\nDr Roman was fascinated by the clear night skies of her childhood home in Nevada from a very early age.\n\nShe joined an astronomy club when she was just 11 and her passion for stargazing continued throughout her life.\n\nBut the young Dr Roman had to fight prejudice to be allowed to study maths and science at school and university.\n\n\"I still remember asking my high school guidance teacher for permission to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin,\" she once told the Voice of America.\n\n\"She looked down her nose at me and sneered, 'What lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?'

And where did they come from?\n\nIn the last few years, the debate over these questions has become more and more heated.\n\nHindu right-wingers believe the source of Indian civilisation are people who called themselves Aryans - a nomadic tribe of horse-riding, cattle-rearing warriors and herders who composed Hinduism's oldest religious texts, the Vedas.\n\nThe Aryans, they argue, originated from India and then spread across large parts of Asia and Europe, helping set up the family of Indo-European languages that Europeans and Indians still speak today.\n\nAs it happens, many 19th Century European ethnographers and, of course, most famously, Adolf Hitler, also considered Aryans the master race who had conquered Europe, although the German leader considered them to be of Nordic lineage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Harappan civilisation thrived in north-western India and Pakistan\n\nWhen scholars use the term Aryan, it refers to a group of people who spoke Indo-European languages and called themselves Aryans. And that is how I have used it in this article. It does not refer to a race, as Hitler used it or as some in the Hindu right wing use it.\n\nMany Indian scholars have questioned the \"out of India\" thesis, arguing that these Indo-European language speakers - or Aryans - were possibly just one of many streams of prehistoric migrants who arrived in India after the decline of an earlier civilisation. This was the Harappan (or Indus Valley) civilisation, which thrived in what is now north-western India and Pakistan around the same time as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.\n\nHowever, Hindu right-wingers believe the Harappan civilisation was also an Aryan or Vedic civilisation.\n\nTensions between the two groups backing these opposing theories have only increased in the last few years, especially since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in India in 2014.\n\nInto this long-running dispute has now stepped the relatively new discipline of population genetics, which has started using ancient DNA to figure out when people moved where.\n\nStudies using ancient DNA have been rewriting prehistory all over the world in the last few years and in India, there has been one fascinating discovery after another.\n\nThe most recent study on this subject, led by geneticist David Reich of Harvard University, was published in March 2018 and co-authored by 92 scholars from all over the world - many of them leading names in disciplines as diverse as genetics, history, archaeology and anthropology.\n\nUnderneath its staid title - The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia - lay some volcanic arguments.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dholavira in Gujarat state is one of the five largest Harappan sites\n\nThe study showed that there were two major migrations into India in the last 10,000 years.\n\nThe first one originated from the Zagros region in south-western Iran (which has the world's first evidence for goat domestication) and brought agriculturists, most likely herders, to India.\n\nThis would have been between 7,000 and 3,000BCE. These Zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent - the First Indians, descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who had reached India around 65,000 years ago - and together, they went on to create the Harappan civilisation.\n\nIn the centuries after 2000 BCE came the second set of immigrants (the Aryans) from the Eurasian Steppe, probably from the region now known as Kazakhstan. They likely brought with them an early version of Sanskrit, mastery over horses and a range of new cultural practices such as sacrificial rituals, all of which formed the basis of early Hindu/Vedic culture. (A thousand years before, people from the Steppe had also moved into Europe, replacing and mixing with agriculturists there, spawning new cultures and spreading Indo-European languages).\n\nOther genetic studies have brought to light more migrations into India, such as that of the speakers of Austro-Asiatic languages who came from south-eastern Asia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption India's population is made up of a number of layers, according to the research\n\nAs I write in my book, the best way to understand the Indian population is to imagine it as a pizza, with the first Indians forming its base. Though the base of this rather irregular pizza is thin in some places and thick in others, it still serves as the support that the rest of the pizza is built upon because studies show that 50% to 65% of the genetic ancestry of Indians derives from the First Indians.\n\nOn top of the base comes the sauce that is spread over the pizza - the Harappans. And then come the toppings and the cheese - the Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European language speakers or Aryans, all of whom found their way into the subcontinent later.\n\nTo many in the Hindu right wing, these findings are unpalatable. They have been campaigning to change school curricula and remove any mention of Aryan immigration from textbooks. And on Twitter, several hugely popular right-wing \"history\" handles have long been attacking India's leading historians who have defended the theory of Aryan migrations and continue to do so.\n\nFor Hindu nationalists, there is a cost to admitting that the Aryans were not the first inhabitants of India and that the Harappan civilisation existed long before their arrival. It would mean acknowledging that Aryans or their Vedic culture were not the singular fountainhead of Indian civilisation and that its earliest sources lay elsewhere.\n\nIndia's junior minister for human resource development, Satyapal Singh, was recently quoted in the media as saying: \"Only Vedic education can nurture our children well and make them patriots who have mental discipline.\"\n\nThe idea of the mixing of different population groups is also unappealing to Hindu nationalists as they put a premium on racial purity. There is also the additional issue of the migration theory putting Aryans on the same footing as latter-day Muslim conquerors of India - such as the Mughals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi - India is a predominantly Hindu nation\n\nThese are not just theoretical debates. The ruling BJP government in Haryana state, which neighbours the Indian capital Delhi, has demanded that the Harappan civilisation be renamed the Saraswati river civilisation. Since the Saraswati is an important river that is mentioned in the earliest of the four Vedic texts, such a renaming would serve to emphasise the link between the civilisation and the Aryans.\n\nThe new study puts an end to these debates and it has thus come as a shock to the Hindu right-wing. In a tweet attacking its co-author Prof Reich, ruling party MP and former Harvard University professor Subramanian Swamy said: \"There are lies, damned lies and (Harvard's 'Third' Reich and Co's) statistics.\"\n\nHowever, the real message that the new research carries is an exciting and hopeful one: that Indians have created a long-lasting civilisation from a variety of heredities and histories.\n\nThe genius of the Indian civilisation during its best periods has been inclusion, not exclusion. Unity in diversity is, indeed, the central theme of India's genetic make-up.\n\nTony Joseph is the author of Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From, published by Juggernaut"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Pete Tong NYE 'balloon drop' cancelled after protests", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46721487", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The Manila resort had hoped to get into the Guinness book of World Records\n\nA plan to break records by releasing 130,000 balloons at a resort in the Philippines on New Year's Eve has been cancelled after a backlash over its potential environmental impact.\n\nThe party, at Okada Manila, is being headlined by British DJ Pete Tong.\n\nOrganisers had insisted the indoor event held no environmental risk as the balloons would be recycled.\n\nBut on Sunday both the resort and Tong confirmed it had been cancelled after the government got involved.\n\nIn a statement, Okada Manila said it \"voluntarily\" decided to cancel the event \"as a sign of respect\" for the government's campaign to protect the environment.\n\nIt came after they received a letter from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Sunday encouraging a change of plan.\n\nThe resort, part of a sprawling hotel and casino complex in the Philippine capital, had said that the balloons were made of \"biodegradable latex materials\" and they would be recycled afterward - not released into the air.\n\nHowever its social media pages had been inundated with concern about its message, including from campaigners such as Greenpeace Philippines.\n\nOne petition, calling for its cancellation, had garnered tens of thousands of signatures before the announcement.\n\nThe party, at the resort's Cove Manila beach club, will still take place without the world-record attempt.\n\nIn a Sunday night tweet Pete Tong confirmed promoters had dropped the balloon stunt.\n\nIn the posts below, people responded positively to the news, and shared images about the dangers of plastic pollution.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The DJ has thanked fans that raised concerns\n\nEnvironmental groups around the world, including the UK's Marine Conservation Society, have warned about the dangers balloons can pose to marine life.\n\nThe organisation says that even latex balloons marked as biodegradable can remain in an ocean environment for four years.\n\nSome places, including parts of Australia, have already banned balloon releases because of their impact."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: Indonesian volcano's dramatic collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46707731", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently\n\nThe scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear.\n\nResearchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea.\n\nThey say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week.\n\nMuch of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement.\n\nIt would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra.\n\nIndonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

He also asked for changes in what he said was the United States' \"ridiculous immigration laws.\"\n\nClosing the U.S.-Mexican border would mean disrupting a $1.68 billion-a-day trade relationship between the two countries.

Top of the list is a man from El Salvador convicted of drunken driving.\n\n\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations, like the five-person field office team outside Richmond, hunt people in the U.S. illegally, some of whom have been here for decades, working and raising families.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, who has pushed hardline immigration policies, ICE has been exposed to unprecedented public scrutiny and criticism, even though officers say they're doing the same job they did before the election \u2014 enforcing U.S. laws that were on the books long before 2016 and prioritizing criminals.\n\n\n\nBut they have also stepped up arrests of people who have no U.S. criminal records. It is those stories of ICE officers arresting dads and grandmothers that pepper local news. Officers are heckled and videotaped. Some Democratic politicians have called for ICE to be abolished.\n\n\n\nICE employees have been threatened at their homes, their personal data exposed online, officials said.\n\n\n\n\"There is a tension around 'It could be that somebody could find out what I do and hate me for it or do worse than hate me for it,'\" Ronald Vitiello, acting head of the agency, told The Associated Press.\n\n\n\nVitiello said the agency is monitoring social media and giving employees resources for when they feel threatened.\n\n\n\nICE, formed after the Sept. 11 attacks, had been told under the Obama administration to focus on removing immigrants who had committed crimes. Trump, in one of his first moves in office, directed his administration to target anyone in the country illegally.\n\nGenerally, people arrested by ICE go before immigration judges, who decide whether they must be deported, and then ICE arranges paperwork and flights out of the country.\n\n\n\nGovernment data backs up that ICE is still mostly targeting people convicted of crimes. But the data also shows the agency has greatly ramped up arrests of people who were accused of crimes but not convicted and increased arrests solely on immigration violations.\n\n\n\nICE arrested 32,977 people accused of crimes and 20,464 with immigration violations during the budget year 2018. There were 105,140 arrests of people with criminal convictions and 158,581 arrests overall. The most frequent criminal conviction was for drunken driving, followed by drug and traffic offenses.\n\nBy comparison, in the last budget year of the Obama administration, there were 94,751 people arrested with convictions, 6,267 arrests of those with pending charges and 9,086 on immigration violations. There were 111,104 arrests overall.\n\n\n\nAdvocates say a traffic violation shouldn't be enough to get you kicked out of the country. They accuse the agency of stoking fear and tearing families apart.\n\n\n\n\"You need some kind of agency to deal with immigration, but ICE is not that,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said on radio station WNYC. \"ICE's time has come and gone. It is broken. ICE has been sent on a very negative, divisive mission, and it cannot function the way it is.\"\n\nIn response, some cities have banished ICE from jails where they could easily pick up immigration violators. Police in New York, Baltimore and Seattle rarely, if ever, give up information on when suspected criminals in the U.S. illegally will be released from custody.\n\n\n\nICE officers now do more street operations and say they end up with more \"collateral arrests,\" people they happen upon who are also in the country illegally. They rarely knock on doors anymore, instead spending hours surveilling and waiting outside. They haunt courthouses.\n\n\n\nIn New York, a Mexican construction worker who has lived in the United States for more than a decade appeared before a judge. He was a week away from clearing his name in a low-level moving vehicle infraction.\n\n\n\nWhen he walked out of the courthouse, ICE officers were waiting for him. He was sent to a detention center and deported less than two weeks later. He left behind a wife and three children.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't do anything,\" said the man, who spoke from Mexico but did not want to be identified because he fears for his family. \"I am a hardworking person. I am not a criminal. I don't understand.\"\n\n\n\nIn Richmond, the team has a long list of targets, but they're the only officers doing fugitive enforcement so they must prioritize. They've been trailing the Salvadoran man for days.\n\n\n\nThey split up into two cars and drive over to his apartment. It's pitch black. They wait. The radio crackles. An officer says someone has left but it's so dark it's impossible to see who it is. Lights flash. It's not who they're looking for; it's a woman. They send her on her way. The officers are jittery, thinking the mistake spooked the target. They wait.\n\n\n\nThe man eventually emerges from his apartment as the sun begins to rise. He's wearing a neon-green shirt and construction work boots. He gets into his blue SUV and pulls out. The officers box him in on both sides and flash blue lights.\n\n\n\nHe's calm as they search him, and he gives them an expired El Salvador passport. His name: Jose Gilberto Macua Gutierrez.\n\n\n\nOne of the officers backs Macua's SUV back into a parking spot, and he's handcuffed, driven back to the office, fingerprinted and placed alone in a holding cell.\n\n\n\nThe operation took too long \u2014 they missed the window for their second target.\n\n\n\nThey will try again.\n\n\n\n\"It's a rare thing to be arrested in the country if you haven't violated the law,\" Vitiello said. \"If someone is here and don't otherwise come across the criminal justice system, it's very rare that they are going to be arrested by ICE, despite the perceptions that are out there.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Makes Big Move Toward 2020 US Presidential Run", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/elizabeth-warren-makes-big-move-toward-2020-us-presidential-run/4722946.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday took the first major step toward launching a widely anticipated campaign for the presidency, hoping her reputation as a populist fighter can help her navigate a Democratic field that could include nearly two dozen candidates.\n\n\u201cNo matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing,\u201d the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a video that highlights her family's history in Oklahoma. \u201cTo be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for and that's why today I'm launching an exploratory committee for president.\u201d\n\nWarren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections. She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.\n\nNow, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of color along with images of a women's march and Warren's participation at an LGBT event.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.\n\nWarren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move toward a presidential bid and has long been a favorite target of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.\n\nBut that's likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps toward White House runs.\n\nWarren enters a Democratic field that's shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens. One of her most significant competitors could be Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.\n\nShe must also move past a widely panned October release of a DNA test meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage. The move was intended to rebut Trump's taunts of Warren as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Instead, her use of a genetic test to prove ethnicity spurred controversy that seemed to blunt any argument she sought to make. There was no direct mention of it in the video released Monday.\n\nWarren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nShe now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year. She has an advantage in the $12.5 million left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run.\n\nWarren's campaign is likely to revolve around the same theme she's woven into speeches and policy proposals in recent years: battling special interests, paying mind to the nexus between racial and economic inequities.\n\n\u201cAmerica's middle class is under attack,\u201d Warren said in the video. \u201cHow did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie.

As many as 60,000 Africans die annually from the disease. Children are most at risk.\n\nThere is no cure for the viral infection, but it can be prevented with the vaccine. Once someone contracts yellow fever, medical treatment consists of easing symptoms of the virus, which include fever, muscle pain and dehydration.\n\nGood sanitation, hygiene and proper drainage are natural ways to reduce risks of the disease.\n\n\n\nNigeria is one of 50 global partners battling to eliminate the disease within the next 10 years.\n\nBesides improving sanitation and clearing stagnant water where mosquitoes breed, Nigeria needs to immunize about 80 percent of the at-risk population to prevent further transmission of the disease."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Nigeria Targets 26M People in Yellow Fever Campaign", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4722520.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Nigeria's campaign to vaccinate more people against yellow fever appears to be making headway.

Bronson is a participant in Oakland, California\u2019s \u201cpot equity\u201d program, but he says the program so far has failed to deliver on many of its promises.\n\nBy Scott Rodd\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 During the 1980s and \u201990s, Alexis Bronson\u2019s illegal cannabis delivery business could barely keep up with demand.\n\nIn the spring, Bronson made weekly trips to the redwood forests of Humboldt County to buy marijuana wholesale from renegade growers with farms hidden in the hills of Northern California. Bronson would wrap 5 or 10 pounds of marijuana in a plastic garbage bag, tuck it into the trunk of his rental car, and head south on Highway 101 to his hometown of Oakland.\n\nHe would buy a pound of marijuana for $1,500 to $1,800 and resell it for nearly triple that amount in Oakland in the 1980s, Bronson said.\n\nBut the lucrative business came with serious risks. Bronson exercised caution about where and when he delivered his product, avoiding traditional street-corner exchanges. It was the war on drugs era, and police worked swiftly to round up dealers and buyers under the mandate to crack down on drug activity.\n\nNow, as more states legalize recreational marijuana and the federal government moves away from incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders, several cities in California are trying to atone for decades of drug enforcement that fell disproportionately upon minorities.\n\nThey\u2019ve created what are known as cannabis equity programs, meant to welcome more minority and low-income entrepreneurs into the now-legal industry.\n\nThe programs provide business development, loan assistance and mentorships to eligible owners. Hundreds have applied in the past year. But \u201cpot equity\u201d has struggled with growing waiting lists, and some participants allege that the programs aren\u2019t fair to the people they\u2019re meant to be helping.\n\nCities such as Oakland have created incubator programs that pair an established marijuana company, called a non-equity business, with an equity cannabis business \u2014 run by an entrepreneur whose background might otherwise make it hard to get into the pot industry.\n\nThe goal of \u201ccannabis equity\u201d is to lower the barriers to entry into the legal cannabis industry for people who were disproportionately impacted by the criminalization of marijuana. The programs base eligibility on a variety of factors, including marijuana convictions, residency in a heavily policed district and income.\n\nToday, several city partnership programs require that established, non-equity businesses provide an equity business with space for several years rent-free. In exchange, the non-equity company receives faster processing for city approvals.\n\nCities such as Sacramento plan to waive up to tens of thousands of dollars in application and permit fees for eligible cannabis businesses.\n\nBut pot equity has struggled to get going. Understaffing in San Francisco\u2019s cannabis office has left a growing waiting list of applicants, and the city doesn\u2019t expect to begin approving businesses until sometime in 2019, said Nicole Elliott, director of San Francisco\u2019s Office of Cannabis.\n\nSome applicants argue that the waiting period has allowed other businesses to get an unfair head start. In Oakland, some pot equity businesses claim their incubator partners never followed through on the requirement to provide them with business development assistance or a space to operate.\n\nBronson, an African-American, now owns one of those equity businesses.\n\nScott Rodd for The Pew Charitable Trusts Early stage cannabis \u201cclone\u201d plants in Alexis Bronson\u2019s Oakland business incubator space. Two previous incubator partners under Oakland, California\u2019s \u201cpot equity\u201d program failed to deliver on their promises, but a third partnership has shown signs of success for Bronson.\n\nAlthough Bronson was never convicted of a cannabis-related crime, his income and residency made him eligible for Oakland\u2019s program.\n\nBut two partner businesses have failed to provide him with promised incubator space, he said. In the meantime, one of Bronson\u2019s state business permits has expired, and he continues to take on debt to keep the existing portion of his business afloat.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t right, because they got their head start,\u201d Bronson said of his partner businesses, who received their expedited processing from the city. \u201cEveryone got what they wanted except for me.\u201d\n\nLasting effects\n\nBetween 1980 and 2010, the number of inmates in federal prisons for drug offenses increased from about 4,700 to nearly 98,000, according to the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy 2016, that number had dropped to about 82,000 as more offenders were being routed through less-punitive drug courts and a growing number of states were decriminalizing marijuana.\n\nAfrican-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite similar rates of usage, according to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn Oakland, African-Americans make up about 30 percent of the population but 77 percent of the people arrested on marijuana charges, according to 2015 data collected by the city and used to establish the equity program.\n\nBeyond the immediate potential consequences of conviction and imprisonment, a drug arrest can have lasting effects. In a 2017 report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified nearly 650 collateral impacts for people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, including limited opportunities for certain professional licenses, education and government assistance.\n\nTo mitigate those effects, the state\u2019s recreational marijuana law allows for clearing or re-sentencing people who were convicted of cannabis-related crimes. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that requires the state Department of Justice to identify and send such convictions to county district attorneys to clear or re-sentence.\n\nDesley Brooks, the outgoing Oakland city councilwoman who helped create its equity program, said few entrepreneurs from low-income and minority communities would have a shot at entering the recreational cannabis industry without the program.\n\n\u201cSo many African-Americans sat \u2014 and continue to sit \u2014 in jail for cannabis offenses as a result of the war on drugs,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t set up a structure to address that, I would have been doing an injustice to many people who were harmed by the system.\u201d\n\nCreating a program to atone for decades of unjust policing \u2014 on top of building the framework for a newly legal cannabis industry \u2014 is no easy task.\n\nOakland is setting up a $3 million fund to provide additional capital assistance to pot equity businesses, Brooks said, but it remains unclear when the fund will become available.\n\nSlow start in San Francisco\n\nSan Francisco applicants have raised the same issue, Elliott said. The office set up an investment fund to provide financial assistance to cannabis businesses, such as low-interest loans. But the city has yet to allocate money to the fund, Elliott said.\n\nShe said San Francisco will likely receive part of the $10 million that the state set aside for local cannabis equity programs in September, which could go toward the city\u2019s cannabis investment fund.\n\n\u201cThere are equity applicants that need money now,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe will advocate aggressively for that state funding.\u201d\n\nAs of mid-December, San Francisco had 227 applicants that qualify for the equity program. Of those, about 110 want to join the city\u2019s incubator partnership program receive permits with waived fees.\n\nElliott said the city will begin approving applicants next year, but she could not say when. Applicants have criticized the lengthy timeline.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Office of Cannabis, which just added two new staff members to bring the total to five, is tasked with reviewing permit applications and facilitating the equity program. Elliott said adding even more staff would speed things up.\n\nIn the meantime, the city has established a partnership with the Bar Association of San Francisco to provide pro bono legal assistance to equity program participants.\n\nMalcolm Mirage, an equity applicant in San Francisco, said the long wait has caused him to burn through capital at an alarming rate. He partnered with MedMen, a household name in the cannabis industry that is publicly traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange.\n\nMedMen agreed to provide business development aid and an incubation space for one of Mirage\u2019s businesses. The company also helped him negotiate leases on two other spaces, and he struck a deal that gave him six months of free rent while he obtains permits to become operational.\n\nMirage figured that was plenty of time. But those six months came and went, and he\u2019s now paying expensive leases on spaces that sit empty."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Moves Toward 2020 Bid With Launch Of Exploratory Committee", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-exploratory-committee_us_5c298352e4b05c88b701a09f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) became the highest-profile Democrat to officially test the waters for a 2020 presidential run, with the launch of an exploratory committee that allows her to start raising money for a campaign.\n\nWarren is making the announcement Monday morning in an email to supporters, accompanied by a video laying out the case for her candidacy. It hews to her core message, that the system is no longer helping working-class Americans.\n\nFrom her email:\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t caused by some indisputable law of physics, like gravity. The problem isn\u2019t that people aren\u2019t willing to work hard. The problem starts in Washington. Our government has been bought and paid for by a bunch of billionaires and giant corporations that think they get to dictate the rules that affect everyone. Tax loopholes. Prescription drug pricing. Financial rules. Environmental protection. These companies define policies that are great for their bottom line, while good, honest people who work hard get squeezed harder every year. It\u2019s corruption, pure and simple. That\u2019s not how government is supposed to work. You know it. I know it. And we know it is time to fight back. I\u2019m forever grateful that I got a chance to go to college for $50 a semester, a chance that opened a million doors for me. I\u2019m grateful, and I\u2019m determined. That\u2019s why I fight my heart out so that everyone gets a real chance in life, a chance to build something solid, a chance to create their piece of the American dream.\n\nWhile Warren is not yet a formal candidate, it is unprecedented in recent political history for a high-profile candidate to decide not to run for president after launching an exploratory committee.\n\nWarren will be on Capitol Hill for the first day of the new 116th Congress on Thursday, and an aide said she expects to hit the road soon for visits to the early primary states.\n\nWarren is one of the fiercest defenders of Dodd-Frank, a massive financial reform bill signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. That law created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren first proposed in 2007 as a Harvard Law School professor.\n\nLong before her time in the Senate, Warren attracted the ire of Republicans. While still a professor, she promised, in an interview with HuffPost, to use her position to fight for a strong Dodd-Frank and CFPB, pledging to put \u201cplenty of blood and teeth\u201d on the Senate floor to do so.\n\nWarren wanted to become director of the CFPB, but GOP senators were so opposed to her appointment that Obama never even nominated her, convinced she couldn\u2019t be confirmed. Instead, she ran for Senate in 2012, taking a seat away from Republicans \u2015 the seat had been won by Scott Brown in a special election \u2015 and becoming a colleague of those same senators who had criticized her.\n\n\u201cWe created America\u2019s first consumer watchdog to hold the big banks accountable,\u201d Warren says in her announcement video. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d run for office. Not in a million years. But when Republican senators tried to sabotage the reforms and run me out of town, I went back to Massachusetts and ran against one of them. And I beat him.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate, Warren has gained national attention in Senate Banking Committee hearings for going after bank executives and government officials who are supposed to be overseeing them. Unlike some senators in some hearings, Warren understands financial policy just as well, if not better, than the people she questions. After Wells Fargo was caught opening millions of fake bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent, Warren tore into the CEO, John Stumpf.\n\n\u201cYour definition of accountability is to push this on your low-level employees,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is gutless leadership.\u201d\n\nShe also, like many other high-profile female politicians, has a way of getting under the skin of some of her male colleagues. Republican senators tried to silence Warren during a speech against Jeff Sessions\u2019 nomination for attorney general in 2017, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) explaining, \u201cSen. Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201d\n\nChris J Ratcliffe via Getty Images\n\nThat last line became a rallying cry for feminists, with Warren at the front and center of the controversy.\n\nShe also became one of the most high-profile critics of President Donald Trump, and he took to calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d to mock her for claiming Native American ancestry. In October, Warren released a DNA test showing \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that she had a Native American ancestor in her family tree, accompanied by a video talking about her family story.\n\nThe DNA test did nothing to silence her critics, and the rollout raised questions, even among Democrats, about whether she understands minority issues fully enough, and whether she\u2019s truly the strongest person to go up against Trump.\n\nLaunching an exploratory committee early allows the candidate to start raising money as soon as possible. Warren already has several dozen staffers in primary and other battleground states, whom she sent there during the midterms to help elect other Democrats. Many of them have stayed, however, and the exploratory committee will allow her to raise the funds to keep paying them.\n\nWithout ever running for president, Warren has become one of the most prolific small-dollar fundraisers in the history of Democratic politics. She raised $42 million, nearly half of that in contributions under $200, in her 2012 run to defeat Brown. And she raised $30 million over the past six years, with two-thirds of that haul coming from small dollar donors. She\u2019s expected to rely on a similar strategy to fund her presidential bid, and like most Democratic candidates in 2020, isn\u2019t expected to rely on a super PAC to boost her candidacy during the primary.\n\nSo far, the only Democrat officially running in 2020 is Rep. John Delaney (Md.). Juli\u00e1n Castro, Obama\u2019s former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has already launched an exploratory committee and plans to announce his next steps in San Antonio, Texas, on Jan. 12. Other potential contenders, like Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) are also expected to potentially jump into the race in the coming weeks.\n\nWhile Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders laid exclusive claim to the progressive lane in his 2016 primary challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Warren will likely face stiff competition to win over progressive voters, including from Sanders himself. (The two senators, longtime political allies, met earlier this month to discuss the likelihood both would run for president.) Warren has tried to separate herself from Sanders by noting she doesn\u2019t share his socialist beliefs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Jim Mattis Implores Defense Department To Defend The Constitution In Farewell Memo", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-mattis-implores-defense-department-to-defend-the-constitution-in-farewell-memo_us_5c2a2a95e4b0407e9084c73d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Shanahan, as deputy defense secretary, was focused on internal Pentagon reform and the creation of Trump\u2019s promised Space Force, according to Reuters.\n\nShanahan \u201chas a deep-seated understanding of military operations, and global security affairs, and importantly, has the breadth of large-scale business management experience that will enable him to effectively oversee the Defense Department,\u201d Reuters reported, citing a senior administration official."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Donald Trump Ends 2018 With At Least A Dozen Ongoing Scandals", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-scandals-2018_us_5c197382e4b02d2cae8e334b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump and members of his administration were embroiled in controversy throughout a long year of news emanating from the White House.

The probe by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan is exploring whether donors gave an eye-popping $107 million for Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2015 a record high that\u2019s more than double what Barack Obama\u2019s committee raised in 2009 \u2015 in exchange for access to Trump\u2019s administration or political influence, which may constitute a violation of federal corruption laws.\n\nIvanka Trump used a personal email account.\n\nWhite House insiders told The Washington Post last month that Cabinet agencies discovered Ivanka Trump has used a personal email account for government business hundreds of times. This could constitute a violation of the Presidential Records Act and increase the risk of sensitive information falling into the wrong hands. The president\u2019s eldest daughter defended her conduct, saying the emails weren\u2019t deleted and that they did not contain \u201canything of substance.\u201d However, the House announced days later that it plans to investigate the allegations.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS First daughter Ivanka Trump is at the forefront of multiple ongoing scandals.\n\nThe Trump Foundation had scandal-plagued finances.\n\nA lawsuit against the Trump Foundation, the president\u2019s personal charity, is continuing to move forward in court after the nonprofit agreed to dissolve in mid-December amid claims that Trump was using it for his personal and political benefit. The probe by New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood alleges that the charity was \u201clittle more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump has continued to denounce the lawsuit and defend his foundation, saying it\u2019s \u201cdone great work and given away lots of money.\u201d\n\nEric Trump lied about his foundation\u2019s expenses.\n\nA probe into spending by Eric Trump\u2019s foundation, which came under investigation after Forbes reported in 2017 that he had shifted donations for children\u2019s cancer research into the Trump family businesses, is ongoing. According to the report\u2019s findings, the Trump third-born\u2019s foundation raised $1.2 million for charity that went to the Trump Organization \u2015 an action that experts say may have flouted federal tax rules and state laws. The report prompted the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office to launch a formal investigation that\u2019s expected to plague the younger Trump into 2019.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Eric Trump's foundation is under investigation for allegedly giving money it raised for charity to his dad's businesses.\n\nForeign diplomats kept staying in Trump-owned properties.\n\nTwo ongoing federal lawsuits allege that Trump may have violated the Constitution when lobbyists representing the Saudi government paid for around 500 nights at the president\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel shortly after he won the 2016 election. The more than $270,000 the Saudis spent may constitute improper payments from foreign governments, the lawsuits claim. The Washington Post uncovered details of the hotel stays earlier this month, reporting that the Saudi-backed lobbyists offered U.S. military veterans all-expenses-paid trips, including stays at the Trump hotel, to have them lobby before Congress against a law the Saudis opposed.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner stand to majorly benefit from a tax break.\n\nTrump\u2019s eldest daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner \u2015 both official advisers to the president \u2015 are still under fire for pushing a tax break that The Associated Press found earlier this month would benefit them financially. The so-called Opportunity Zone program offers sizable tax breaks to developers investing in a select group of struggling communities in the U.S. \u2015 a number of which the couple already have large real estate stakes in. The findings shed further light on why their decision to become advisers to the president without divesting from their real estate holdings has created an ethics mess.\n\nIvanka Trump had trademarks approved by China.\n\nThe Chinese government granted Ivanka Trump more than a dozen new trademark approvals this year for her shuttered fashion brand, covering items ranging from handbags and shoes to voting machines and sausage casings. The news sparked claims that the Trump family had used its pull in government to smooth negotiations for the family business, even as the White House was doubling down on a trade war with China that affected American manufacturers.\n\nScott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke resigned amid scandals.\n\nThe exodus of Cabinet members from the Trump administration has continued in force this year, and many of the departing officials have left under a cloud of scrutiny due to investigations.\n\nFormer Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July amid more than a dozen federal investigations into his leadership at the agency, including allegations of spending abuses and friendliness with energy lobbyists. Pruitt was instrumental in Trump\u2019s initial efforts to roll back many of the nation\u2019s premier environmental regulations and his announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP Trump's former EPA chief Scott Pruitt had one of the year's most scandal-plagued exits from the White House.\n\nFacing nearly 20 federal investigations, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was also forced out in December amid accusations that he billed taxpayers for private charter flights and traveled on an oil company\u2019s jet without proper approval. Criticism has also surrounded Zinke\u2019s ties to a real estate deal in Montana that could result in federal charges.\n\nJared Kushner got bailed out by a company linked to Qatar.\n\nIn May, media outlets reported that Kushner Companies, the real estate empire controlled by the family of Jared Kushner, was close to getting a bailout from a company linked to the government of Qatar. Critics said the deal raised new concerns about Kushner, who serves as the White House\u2019s point person on Middle East issues, by entangling government and personal business. Kushner resigned as the CEO of his family\u2019s company last year but still holds a financial stake in the business.\n\nThe company behind the bailout, Brookfield Asset Management, has said that \u201cno Qatar-linked entity\u201d was involved in the deal, finalized in August. Brookfield\u2019s real estate arm is partially owned by the Qatar Investment Authority.\n\nTrump has spent more than two months at Mar-a-Lago, and club members have bragged about it.\n\nTrump spent 78 days at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, since he entered the White House, and he\u2019s there so frequently that some members of the club have begun to brag about their purported influence on the president. ProPublica reported in August that the chairman of Marvel Entertainment, alongside two other Mar-a-Lago members, have been unofficially lobbying Trump on veterans affairs policy that could affect millions of Americans around the country.\n\nNICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images Trump spent a whopping 78 days this year at his Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nThe fabled club has only become more exclusive since Trump became president. The membership fee doubled to $200,000 last year, and events can cost upwards of $2,500 a couple. Some bills for parties have already been sent directly to taxpayers.\n\nMelania Trump kept taking expensive trips.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump came under fire after her one-day trip to Cairo in October cost taxpayers more than $95,000. Her spokeswoman gave critics even more fodder by saying Trump didn\u2019t even \u201cstay the night\u201d at the InterContinental Cairo Semiramis hotel and was only in the city for six hours. The first lady\u2019s one-day visit to Toronto in 2017 also cost the government around $174,000 in hotel bills.\n\nCabinet secretaries have made some questionable investments.\n\nTrump has one of the wealthiest Cabinets in modern history, and many secretaries have complex investment portfolios. Critics have been keeping a close eye on them to see if they\u2019ve divested from any investments that could present a conflict of interest, but some have made questionable moves regardless."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Rep.

Kimberly-Clark, Kotex\u2019s parent company, said in a press release it received \u201ca small number of reports of infections, vaginal irritation, localized vaginal injury, and other symptoms\u201d and that in some cases consumers had to seek medical attention \u201cto remove tampon pieces left in the body.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there is no federal or state law requiring Kotex, or any other menstrual hygiene company, to share the ingredients \u2014 including the chemicals \u2014 that make up its products. This is a problem, says Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic member of the New York state Assembly. When tampons are falling apart inside people\u2019s bodies, she told HuffPost, doctors should be able to know how to treat these patients. But they\u2019ll struggle to do it if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the problem, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd who knows what the long-term effects are?\u201d Rosenthal asked in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s case in point for why we need ingredient labeling on products people put inside their body.\u201d\n\nRosenthal is sponsoring legislation in New York to require ingredient labeling on the packaging of all menstrual products sold in the state. The Assembly is expected to consider the bill in 2019; if it passes, it will be the first law of its kind in the United States.\n\nManufacturers might list some, but not all, ingredients on feminine hygiene packaging or on their products\u2019 websites.\n\nIn a letter to Kimberly-Clark, the Assembly member asked the company to \u201cpublicly disclose the chemicals present in these products so that menstruators can work with their health care providers to properly manage risks associated with exposure.\u201d She has yet to receive a response.\n\nBrett Carlsen via Getty Images Linda Rosenthal of the New York state Assembly wants to make it mandatory for tampon companies to disclose the ingredients they use in their products.\n\nRosenthal isn\u2019t alone in her fight. In 2017, for example, the Menstrual Products Right to Know Act was introduced in Congress, though it later stalled.\n\n\u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said. She fears these products contains an array of chemicals that \u201cmore and more people are becoming sensitive to.\u201d\n\nA recent study commissioned by the organization Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth detected chemicals like carbon disulfide, a known reproductive toxin, and methylene chloride, a potential occupational carcinogen, in popular tampon brands. These ingredients are not disclosed on product packaging. (WVE, it should be noted, partners with two menstrual product brands, Seventh Generation and Natracare, both of which appeared free of chemicals in the testing.)\n\nThis is not the only study on menstrual products and potential contaminants, but research into the topic is limited. There are also conflicting opinions on what is considered \u201csafe\u201d when it comes to the levels of chemicals in these products. Trace amounts of dioxin, a chemical that has been associated with endometriosis, have been deemed \u201csafe\u201d by the Food and Drug Administration, The New York Times reported in 2017. Manufacturers are required to assess the dioxin levels in their products on their own, and then provide the FDA with their results.\n\nSome experts worry that the harmfulness of dioxin could be greater than is widely assumed. Carolyn Nygaard, a naturopathic physician, told The Guardian in 2016 that she is unsure of the chemical\u2019s effects on women\u2019s health over time, and isn\u2019t confident the FDA considers this. Women menstruate for up to 40 years, Nygaard told The Guardian, wearing up to 20 tampons once a month, 13 times a year. \u201cSo there is the potential to have cumulative effects from that,\u201d she said. The vaginal membrane is more absorptive than skin on other parts of the body, which raises specific concerns around chemicals like dioxin in products meant to be inserted vaginally, the publication noted.\n\nPhotographyFirm via Getty Images \u201cI think, usually, if you\u2019re afraid of revealing something, it\u2019s something not so good,\u201d Rosenthal said.\n\nRosenthal is a pioneer in fronting legislation for fair treatment of people who menstruate.\n\nIn March 2018, she introduced the Total Access to Menstrual Products Act to the Assembly. The TAMP Act would require all female-designated bathrooms in the state of New York to provide hygiene products at no cost.\n\n\u201cToilet paper is assumed in every bathroom,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cWhy should there not be products to help half the population deal with their biological function? It doesn\u2019t make sense. If you can expect toilet paper, you should be able to expect menstrual products.\u201d\n\nRosenthal also helped spearhead a bill that would require state correctional facilities to provide incarcerated people with menstrual products at no cost. The bill passed.\n\nUltimately, Rosenthal said, laws relating to menstrual health will help to reduce the stigma and shame that surrounds the topic.\n\nThe fight for these types of legal actions underscores how desperately we need more women in power, Rosenthal added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "California Cities Struggle To Help Minorities Build Marijuana Businesses", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cannabis-marijuana-equity-minority_us_5c264859e4b04aa0a171b8ac", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Scott Rodd for The Pew Charitable Trusts Alexis Bronson smells one of his latest cannabis \u201cclone\u201d plants, a specialty strain. Bronson is a participant in Oakland, California\u2019s \u201cpot equity\u201d program, but he says the program so far has failed to deliver on many of its promises.\n\nBy Scott Rodd\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 During the 1980s and \u201990s, Alexis Bronson\u2019s illegal cannabis delivery business could barely keep up with demand.\n\nIn the spring, Bronson made weekly trips to the redwood forests of Humboldt County to buy marijuana wholesale from renegade growers with farms hidden in the hills of Northern California. Bronson would wrap 5 or 10 pounds of marijuana in a plastic garbage bag, tuck it into the trunk of his rental car, and head south on Highway 101 to his hometown of Oakland.\n\nHe would buy a pound of marijuana for $1,500 to $1,800 and resell it for nearly triple that amount in Oakland in the 1980s, Bronson said.\n\nBut the lucrative business came with serious risks. Bronson exercised caution about where and when he delivered his product, avoiding traditional street-corner exchanges. It was the war on drugs era, and police worked swiftly to round up dealers and buyers under the mandate to crack down on drug activity.\n\nNow, as more states legalize recreational marijuana and the federal government moves away from incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders, several cities in California are trying to atone for decades of drug enforcement that fell disproportionately upon minorities.\n\nThey\u2019ve created what are known as cannabis equity programs, meant to welcome more minority and low-income entrepreneurs into the now-legal industry.\n\nThe programs provide business development, loan assistance and mentorships to eligible owners. Hundreds have applied in the past year. But \u201cpot equity\u201d has struggled with growing waiting lists, and some participants allege that the programs aren\u2019t fair to the people they\u2019re meant to be helping.\n\nCities such as Oakland have created incubator programs that pair an established marijuana company, called a non-equity business, with an equity cannabis business \u2014 run by an entrepreneur whose background might otherwise make it hard to get into the pot industry.\n\nThe goal of \u201ccannabis equity\u201d is to lower the barriers to entry into the legal cannabis industry for people who were disproportionately impacted by the criminalization of marijuana. The programs base eligibility on a variety of factors, including marijuana convictions, residency in a heavily policed district and income.\n\nToday, several city partnership programs require that established, non-equity businesses provide an equity business with space for several years rent-free. In exchange, the non-equity company receives faster processing for city approvals.\n\nCities such as Sacramento plan to waive up to tens of thousands of dollars in application and permit fees for eligible cannabis businesses.\n\nBut pot equity has struggled to get going. Understaffing in San Francisco\u2019s cannabis office has left a growing waiting list of applicants, and the city doesn\u2019t expect to begin approving businesses until sometime in 2019, said Nicole Elliott, director of San Francisco\u2019s Office of Cannabis.\n\nSome applicants argue that the waiting period has allowed other businesses to get an unfair head start. In Oakland, some pot equity businesses claim their incubator partners never followed through on the requirement to provide them with business development assistance or a space to operate.\n\nBronson, an African-American, now owns one of those equity businesses.\n\nScott Rodd for The Pew Charitable Trusts Early stage cannabis \u201cclone\u201d plants in Alexis Bronson\u2019s Oakland business incubator space. Two previous incubator partners under Oakland, California\u2019s \u201cpot equity\u201d program failed to deliver on their promises, but a third partnership has shown signs of success for Bronson.\n\nAlthough Bronson was never convicted of a cannabis-related crime, his income and residency made him eligible for Oakland\u2019s program.\n\nBut two partner businesses have failed to provide him with promised incubator space, he said. In the meantime, one of Bronson\u2019s state business permits has expired, and he continues to take on debt to keep the existing portion of his business afloat.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t right, because they got their head start,\u201d Bronson said of his partner businesses, who received their expedited processing from the city. \u201cEveryone got what they wanted except for me.\u201d\n\nLasting effects\n\nBetween 1980 and 2010, the number of inmates in federal prisons for drug offenses increased from about 4,700 to nearly 98,000, according to the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy 2016, that number had dropped to about 82,000 as more offenders were being routed through less-punitive drug courts and a growing number of states were decriminalizing marijuana.\n\nAfrican-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite similar rates of usage, according to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn Oakland, African-Americans make up about 30 percent of the population but 77 percent of the people arrested on marijuana charges, according to 2015 data collected by the city and used to establish the equity program.\n\nBeyond the immediate potential consequences of conviction and imprisonment, a drug arrest can have lasting effects. In a 2017 report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified nearly 650 collateral impacts for people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, including limited opportunities for certain professional licenses, education and government assistance.\n\nTo mitigate those effects, the state\u2019s recreational marijuana law allows for clearing or re-sentencing people who were convicted of cannabis-related crimes. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that requires the state Department of Justice to identify and send such convictions to county district attorneys to clear or re-sentence.\n\nDesley Brooks, the outgoing Oakland city councilwoman who helped create its equity program, said few entrepreneurs from low-income and minority communities would have a shot at entering the recreational cannabis industry without the program.\n\n\u201cSo many African-Americans sat \u2014 and continue to sit \u2014 in jail for cannabis offenses as a result of the war on drugs,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t set up a structure to address that, I would have been doing an injustice to many people who were harmed by the system.\u201d\n\nCreating a program to atone for decades of unjust policing \u2014 on top of building the framework for a newly legal cannabis industry \u2014 is no easy task.\n\nOakland is setting up a $3 million fund to provide additional capital assistance to pot equity businesses, Brooks said, but it remains unclear when the fund will become available.\n\nSlow start in San Francisco\n\nSan Francisco applicants have raised the same issue, Elliott said. The office set up an investment fund to provide financial assistance to cannabis businesses, such as low-interest loans. But the city has yet to allocate money to the fund, Elliott said.\n\nShe said San Francisco will likely receive part of the $10 million that the state set aside for local cannabis equity programs in September, which could go toward the city\u2019s cannabis investment fund.\n\n\u201cThere are equity applicants that need money now,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe will advocate aggressively for that state funding.\u201d\n\nAs of mid-December, San Francisco had 227 applicants that qualify for the equity program. Of those, about 110 want to join the city\u2019s incubator partnership program receive permits with waived fees.\n\nElliott said the city will begin approving applicants next year, but she could not say when. Applicants have criticized the lengthy timeline.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Office of Cannabis, which just added two new staff members to bring the total to five, is tasked with reviewing permit applications and facilitating the equity program. Elliott said adding even more staff would speed things up.\n\nIn the meantime, the city has established a partnership with the Bar Association of San Francisco to provide pro bono legal assistance to equity program participants.\n\nMalcolm Mirage, an equity applicant in San Francisco, said the long wait has caused him to burn through capital at an alarming rate. He partnered with MedMen, a household name in the cannabis industry that is publicly traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange.\n\nMedMen agreed to provide business development aid and an incubation space for one of Mirage\u2019s businesses. The company also helped him negotiate leases on two other spaces, and he struck a deal that gave him six months of free rent while he obtains permits to become operational.\n\nMirage figured that was plenty of time. But those six months came and went, and he\u2019s now paying expensive leases on spaces that sit empty."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "It\u2019s OK That I Don\u2019t Drink.

I have never been hungover, and though I\u2019m from Spain, where socializing inevitably involves alcohol, I\u2019m able to have a fun time and even go out until 7 in the morning without feeling the need to drink. My choice not to drink is a personal one, but in my opinion, it\u2019s a healthy choice that should be celebrated.\n\nYet when someone offers me a glass of wine and I refuse it, I attract curious looks and quite a few unsettling reactions. From total strangers asserting that I must be a very boring person to PR reps flat-out asking me if I am a recovering addict, it is somehow socially acceptable to put someone on the spot for not drinking.\n\nI was a teenager when I realized that drinking was truly not worth it for me. At age 14, I developed severe gastritis due to a Helicobacter pylori infection, and while I was under treatment I had to stick to a very mild diet and absolutely no alcohol. So when most of my friends starting going out on the weekends and binge-drinking to have fun, I had to find a way to be a part of the group without jeopardizing my health.\n\nIf there is any silver lining to being sick because someone prepared a contaminated meal, it was that I didn\u2019t develop a taste for alcohol.\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t want to be cut out of the group or considered a party pooper. If you think your teenage years were confusing, add to the mix having to pretend that you drink. Was there vodka at the party? I would refuse it under the pretense that only rum gave me a nice buzz. Were my friends bringing in their own alcohol? I would bring my flask, which happened to be filled with a watered-down syrup that smelled so strong it could pass for alcohol.\n\nAt some point, I realized there was no point in pretending to be cool. I found a new group of friends who understood that I simply couldn\u2019t drink, and made sure there were plenty of soft drinks on hand when we went out until the early hours of the morning.\n\nIt took me three years to recover from the H. pylori infection and its aftermath. By age 17, I had never been drunk, the few liquors I had ever tried felt like they were burning my insides raw, and I realized that alcohol tastes bad. My logical conclusion was that I was better off being sober. I had managed to go through my teenage years in absolute sobriety and still had a fun group of friends and a cute boyfriend, so my understanding was that the adult world would be a bit more mature about my choice.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nFast-forward to last year\u2019s New York Fashion Week. I was invited to a fun afternoon event because I was covering several shows. After being greeted by the hostess, the PR rep for the brand approached me and my friend and offered us something to drink. My friend went for wine, and I asked for a soft drink. She said they didn\u2019t have soft drinks, but that I could choose between four varieties of wine and vodka. I said that a glass of water would be fine then.\n\nOh, the look on her face. She started grilling me with questions about why I didn\u2019t want the other beverage choices. I calmly stated that I just don\u2019t drink alcohol.\n\n\u201cI see, you are a recovering alcoholic!\u201d she practically yelled.\n\nSober people don\u2019t owe you any explanation whatsoever for our perfectly valid choice.\n\nTo this day, I still cannot understand what made her think it was OK to scream what to some people is very private information out loud in a public setting. After three decades of sobriety and 10 in the industry, I truly didn\u2019t see that one coming.\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg. Early in my career, my bosses decided that the whole office had to participate in a compulsory team-building exercise for the holidays. Fair enough. Their poison of choice? A wine-tasting evening.\n\nI calmly explained that I would gladly go, but given the fact that I don\u2019t drink, I wouldn\u2019t actually partake in the actual tasting portion. The head of the office mumbled something about me being a killjoy. At the actual event, the workshop leader spent half the time trying to force me to drink the damn wine.\n\nAre you getting the picture of what it means to be sober in a social context? Merry Christmas to me.\n\nThe truth is that sobriety, like drinking alcohol, is just another personal choice. Very much like going on a vegan diet, playing sports, recycling or picking a career. I don\u2019t drink, but I don\u2019t mind if you, my friends, my family or my work colleagues drink. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nSo why does my sobriety make people around me so uncomfortable that they grill me with questions to try to understand why I would prefer to stick with a soft drink while everyone else is binging on the open bar? Although I very much wish to answer that it\u2019s really none of their f**king business, social conventions again demand that I graciously explain the many reasons I don\u2019t like alcohol. I\u2019m just tired of this sober-shaming nonsense. I have never been drunk; get over it.\n\nThe truth is that you don\u2019t know what is happening in a person\u2019s life when you decide to ask why someone doesn\u2019t drink. A person can be sober for many different reasons. The cute guy might be the designated driver for the night. The blonde in the red dress might be in the early stages of a much-desired pregnancy. That person you just met might be waiting for a liver transplant. The fun guy at the office might be in recovery after a long battle with alcoholism and your question might jeopardize the entire process. That girl at the party might be following a religious practice. And so on and so forth.\n\nStop being the alcohol police. Sober people don\u2019t owe you any explanation whatsoever for our perfectly valid choice. So if you are throwing a party or hosting a holiday gathering, please practice true hospitality by having an assortment of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, and leaving your guests alone to drink or not drink as they please."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "4 Devious Ways States Chipped Away At Abortion Rights In 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-abortion-rights-erosion-2018_us_5c1be156e4b0407e907886b8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Joel Carillet via Getty Images An abortion-rights demonstration in front of the Supreme Court in June. This year, abortion opponents have pushed legislation aimed at drawing lawsuits, with the hope those cases will eventually land in front of the Supreme Court and test Roe v. Wade.\n\nEvery year, anti-abortion legislators and legislatures chip away at reproductive rights, and 2018 brought a wave of extreme restrictions from lawmakers determined to topple Roe v. Wade. This year, as of Dec. 11, 22 abortion restrictions were passed nationwide \u2014 a number that will likely edge up to 24 by the time 2019 begins.\n\nOn the surface, that number looks pretty good. It\u2019s the fewest abortion restrictions passed in a single year in more than a decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and promotes reproductive health policy. And for the first time in recent years, the number of proactive reproductive health policies \u2014 measures that make it easier for women to access abortion services and birth control, for example \u2014 outpaced the number of restrictions.\n\nAnd yet ... the laws that legislators pushed through in 2018 and the rhetoric they used were extreme and aggressive in ways that deeply unsettled reproductive rights advocates, said Elizabeth Nash, the senior state issues manager at Guttmacher, particularly given the Supreme Court\u2019s new conservative majority. Furthermore, new laws don\u2019t tell the full picture as some states tried to resurrect old anti-abortion legislation with that new conservative majority mind.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw this year was a lower number of enacted restrictions,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBut some of these are so extreme that it\u2019s a shift in the type of restrictions we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s not captured in the pure number.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how anti-abortion legislators targeted abortion access in 2018.\n\nThey instituted restrictions that make it really hard \u2014 often impossible \u2014 for women to get abortions within a legal time frame\n\nThe most extreme abortion restriction of 2018 came out of Iowa, which banned abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 at around six weeks gestation \u2014 except in cases of rape or incest or if the woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nSix weeks is so early in a pregnancy that a woman might not know she\u2019s pregnant yet; the law bans abortion before many women even realize they\u2019ve missed a period. And even if they know they\u2019re pregnant before six weeks, it leaves virtually no time for them to find an abortion provider, book an appointment, come up with the money they need and tackle any of the many other logistical hurdles women must contend with.\n\nCutting off access to abortion at a certain point in pregnancy is nothing new, Nash said, but the drive to do it earlier and earlier is a shift toward the extreme. In past years, states focused on banning abortions at 20 weeks gestation, or about the halfway point in a woman\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 not in the first few weeks.\n\nThat Iowa law is tied up in the courts, meaning it is not in effect, but Ohio came close to enacting a similar bill, which Gov. John Kasich vetoed just before Christmas. Likewise, Mississippi is one of two states that passed a ban on most abortions after the 15-week mark. It too has been blocked by the courts, but the state\u2019s attorney general has said he will appeal.\n\n\u201cIn some states that already have so many restrictions on the books, all that is left is to ban abortion,\u201d Nash argued. \u201cThey\u2019ve restricted access to the extent that\u2019s possible, so now the next big leap is an early abortion ban.\u201d\n\nThey played on concerns about discrimination in order to stigmatize women who seek abortions\n\nIn the fall, Indiana\u2019s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to overrule two previous court decisions blocking a 2016 state law that, among other things, barred women from getting an abortion based on the race or gender of a fetus or in cases in which a fetus has a disability.\n\nThat sort of legislation falls under the broad umbrella of what Nash called \u201creason bans,\u201d which prohibit women from terminating a pregnancy based on things like sex or race. Anti-abortion legislators argue they\u2019re solely meant to prohibit discrimination, but reproductive rights advocates call BS. They say they\u2019re nothing more than an effort to further limit abortion access while fueling stigma by legally requiring doctors to question their patients\u2019 motives.\n\nLast year Ohio\u2019s governor signed a similar bill that would make it a felony for doctors to perform an abortion for any woman whose fetus has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. Some parents of children with Down syndrome have supported the measure, while others have criticized what they see as a bad faith effort from anti-abortion lawmakers. For now, it too is tied up in court.\n\n\u201cIf [legislators] really cared about making the community better for my daughter, they\u2019d provide more funding for programs that help her. They\u2019d help improve inclusion in schools. They\u2019d help educate parents that Down syndrome doesn\u2019t have to be scary,\u201d one woman told HuffPost last March. \u201cI have a whole bunch of issues I would love to have legislators\u2019 help with.\u201d\n\nThey used gruesome, imprecise language to paint a safe and common method of abortion as cruel and barbaric\n\nBans on dilation and evacuation procedures, one of the most common ways doctors perform second-trimester abortions, gained traction once again in 2018. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said D&Es, as they\u2019re often called, are a safe way to remove the contents of the uterus and can be done as an outpatient surgery with general or regional anesthesia \u2014 but legislators have used inflammatory language painting it as a barbarous act.\n\nFor example, in Kentucky, which passed a 2018 ban on D&E abortions, a bill didn\u2019t say \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d anywhere. Instead, it banned procedures that cause \u201cbodily dismemberment,\u201d \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201chuman vivisection.\u201d And that rhetoric, Nash said, represents a real shift.\n\n\u201cThe language isn\u2019t about protecting health or fetal rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe language is simply trying to paint the procedure as something dangerous, something terrible that no one would ever want to undergo. And oh, by the way, it would make it very hard if not impossible to access abortion after 15 weeks, so that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nThey wrote laws they knew would be challenged in court in a big and public way, with the goal of toppling Roe v. Wade\n\nFor Nash, perhaps the most worrisome shift of 2018 was the ramping up of likely unconstitutional legislation aimed at drawing lawsuits, with the hope those cases will eventually land in front of the Supreme Court and test Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said while campaigning for the presidency that he believed the landmark decision would be overturned \u201cautomatically\u201d because it was his intention to put several conservative judges on the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on abortion rights, retired in June, and now two of Trump\u2019s appointees sit on the court.\n\n\u201cYou have states across the country that are essentially lining up with prefiled abortion bans,\u201d Nash said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Trauma Is The Norm For Many New Orleans Kids. This School Was Made For Them.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-orleans-school-trauma_us_5c1d2c7fe4b0407e907abcf3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "This story is a collaboration between HuffPost and The Lens.\n\nThis year, the kids learned papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Their creations line the walls of the art and electives room. In the adjacent hallway, bright blue plywood covers the spots where students punched or kicked holes in the drywall as they passed between classes.\n\nThis is the middle school campus for the New Orleans Center for Resilience, a nonprofit K\u20138 school with two locations in the city. The 27 kids enrolled in the center\u2019s program have some of the most extreme behavior needs in the city, often stemming from trauma or mental illness. A typical student may have exhibited verbal and physical aggression, caused property damage or refused to do classwork. It\u2019s a place for kids who have almost nowhere else to turn \u2014 when they\u2019ve been asked or told to leave their previous schools.\n\n\u201cA lot of the kids who are referred here have experienced significant complex trauma,\u201d said Liz Marcell Williams, the center\u2019s director. \u201cWhether they themselves have been victims of trauma or they\u2019re exposed to violence in the home or in the community or have experienced significant loss of a loved one due to long-term incarceration or death.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans, a high-poverty, high-crime city, has particularly pressing needs when it comes to trauma and behavioral health.\n\nA survey of about 1,200 New Orleans kids ages 10 to 16, released in 2015, found that nearly 40 percent had witnessed domestic violence, a shooting, a stabbing or a beating. About 18 percent reported witnessing a murder. And more than half said that someone close to them had been murdered.\n\nThe survey found that children in New Orleans displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at more than three times the national average.\n\nThe center, which was known as the Therapeutic Day Program until Dec. 1, is a rare lifeline to the few who get in. When it opened in 2015, it was the first school of its kind in New Orleans, offering a blend of traditional classes like math and English, as well as therapy and counseling. In a city where student mental health resources remain scant, there are few places like it today.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Misty Johnson does a warm-up activity with Jordan Coughlin, a math teacher at the Center for Resilience.\n\nKids who arrive at the center are usually three grade levels behind in math and reading, said Williams, who has a background in special education and designed the school\u2019s curriculum. Her goal is to get kids back into the mainstream school system. Students attend the center for an average of 15 months.\n\nNine-year-old Misty Johnson, who has ADHD and bipolar disorder, has been in the program for two years. Her mom, Dawn Johnson, said Misty is almost ready to return to a charter elementary school.\n\nJohnson admitted that she was worried when she first visited the center. \u201cThe other kids were just like Misty,\u201d she said, adding that she thought it might be overwhelming for her daughter.\n\nOver time, however, she saw improvements in Misty\u2019s behavior and academics. Many of the classes here are tiny; some have just two students. Misty was getting lots of one-on-one attention. The school called Johnson regularly to give updates.\n\nThis year the center started assigning students a home base room, where they begin their day with breakfast. The home base is meant to be a safe room, and students may return there during the day if they need to opt out of a class or activity. In a typical school, students don\u2019t usually have the option to walk out of class if they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Abel Thompson, a second-grader, displays his newly crafted Santa Claus beard. In addition to academic offerings, various activities \u2014 from sports to play to art \u2014 are integrated into a school day at the Center for Resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always thinking about how do we minimize power struggles,\u201d Williams said. The home base room really helped them with that, she added. From August to November last year, the center had 235 behavioral incidents requiring an adult crisis response, she said. This year in the same time frame, there were 77. The home base rooms were partly responsible for that, she said.\n\nDespite the high rate of turnover at the center, most kids who apply for a spot at the tiny school never get in.\n\nOnly 45 kids have attended since the school opened. Erin LaFleur wanted her 14-year-old son, Brady, to be one of them. He has bipolar disorder, autism and Down syndrome and spent time in a state-run facility that was several hours away by car. She fought long and hard to navigate the New Orleans public school system for him, and she said she thought the center\u2019s day program would be a perfect fit.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t get in.\n\nHe lacked the verbal communication and social skills necessary for the program, a rejection letter stated.\n\n\u201cIt would benefit children with intellectual disabilities who have behavior disorders if [the center] accepted them,\u201d LaFleur said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

The House is expected to vote on the package on Thursday, after the new Congress convenes with Democrats in control and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California sworn in as speaker.\n\nWhile the measures are expected to pass the House, there is no guarantee the shutdown will soon end given the Senate is still firmly controlled by Republicans.

But White House officials and others close to the president also believe that a shutdown is unlikely to help Ms. Pelosi as she takes over as part of the new House majority, and that Democratic officials risk looking unreasonable.\n\nPelosi allies say that they think the shutdown will help her look like the adult in the room, because she is going to quickly move to end it, demonstrating that Democrats are serious about governing.\n\nMs. Conway did not rule out a presidential veto of the bill the House Democrats plan to advance.\n\n\u201cIt depends what\u2019s in it,\u201d she said.\n\nSenator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the Senate would not take up the House bill unless Mr. Trump backed it.

They were also notable given Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence for most of his term that the border would have a wall, not the \u201csteel slat barrier\u201d he has pivoted toward in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not a wall,\u201d Mr. Kelly told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nMr. Kelly, whose last day in his role is Monday, said he had sought advice from Customs and Border Protection officials early in 2017, when he was the homeland security secretary.

But the required pre-approval for raids is often last-minute, or skipped until afterward, the officials say.\n\nFor months, The New York Times has investigated the human toll of the C.I.A.-sponsored forces on communities.

One former senior Afghan security official bluntly accused the strike forces of war crimes.\n\nOften, the raids that resulted in civilian deaths were carried out not far from police outposts or government offices, leaving those American-supported officials humiliated in the villages they had been trying to establish relationships with.

An identification card would then be mailed to the primary address listed by the individual seeking the ID; receipt of the card was considered sufficient secondary proof of residency.\n\nBut in November, the D.M.V. was told in a letter from the Department of Homeland Security that its system was not compliant with federal requirements.

It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics.

For older adults alone, this increased health care costs by 46 percent over a period of 10 years, compared with costs incurred by those without hearing loss, the authors reported in November in JAMA Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nOne of the authors, Jennifer A. Deal, an epidemiologist and gerontologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while \u201chearing loss itself is not very expensive, the effect of hearing loss on everything else is expensive.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, people tend to wait much too long to get their hearing tested and treated with hearing aids, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to treat hearing loss, Dr. Lin told me.\n\nAge-related hearing loss comes on really slowly, making it harder for people to know when to take it seriously, he said. He cited two good clues to when to get your hearing tested: Family members or close friends say you should, or you notice that you often mishear or don\u2019t know what others are saying.\n\nBut even when people are tested and spend thousands of dollars to purchase needed hearing aids, the devices often sit in a drawer. People may complain that the sound quality is poor, too static-y or otherwise annoying, and that the aids merely amplify all sound, making it still hard to hear in a noisy environment. All aids are not created equal, Dr. Lin said, and even expensive, properly fitted aids can require multiple adjustments. Some people give up too readily to get the best results.\n\n\u201cUnrealistic expectations are a big part of this problem,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting on a pair of glasses that immediately enables you to see clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing loss is not fixed as easily as eyesight. The brain needs time \u2014 a good month or two \u2014 to adjust to hearing aids. And the earlier hearing loss is treated, the easier it is for the brain to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe new studies give ample cause for taking hearing loss seriously. Consider, for example, the link to dementia. People who can\u2019t hear well often become socially isolated and deprived of stimuli that keep the brain cognitively engaged.
