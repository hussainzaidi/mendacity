Journalism advocacy groups say it could have a chilling effect on news coverage.\n\nJudge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.\n\nCNN and Acosta are asking Kelly for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would restore his access right away.\n\nLawyers for CNN and Acosta are arguing that time is of the essence because his rights are violated every day his pass is suspended.\n\nThey are also seeking a declaration that Trump's action was \"unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" This could protect other reporters against similar actions in the future.\n\nThe government's filing quotes a tweet by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in which she announced the suspension of Acosta's pass and saying his \"conduct is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe \"conduct\" mentioned by Sanders in the tweet that the government lawyers cite actually refers to a false and since-dropped argument that Sanders had made in the aftermath of the press conference \u2014 that Acosta was \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\"\n\nThe administration has backed away from that argument in recent days, and it makes no appearance in the government's first legal comment on the case Wednesday. Even when the filing directly quotes Sanders' tweets, it leaves out that part.\n\nThe government's lawyers said in Wednesday's filing that the back and forth between President Trump and Acosta during last week's press conference, during which Trump strongly criticized Acosta, qualifies as \"due process.\" They also cite Sanders' statement the night of that press conference as \"notice of the factual bases for denial.\"\n\n\"The President had similarly criticized Mr. Acosta's conduct during that press conference, which complemented Ms. Sanders' notice,\" the government argued.\n\nThe government also claimed that CNN can't be harmed by the banning of one of its journalists, arguing that the \"network has roughly 50 other employees who retain hard passes and who are more than capable of covering the White House complex on CNN's behalf.\"\n\nCNN is expected to respond later on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is a very, very important case,\" Ted Olson said. Olson, a Republican heavyweight who successfully argued for George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, is representing CNN along with another prominent outside attorney, Theodore Boutrous, and the network's chief counsel, David Vigilante.\n\nOlson said Tuesday that it was Acosta whose press pass was suspended this time, but \"this could happen to any journalist by any politician.\"\n\nHe spoke forcefully against Trump's action. \"The White House cannot get away with this,\" he said in an interview with CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nCNN's lawyers say the case hinges on Acosta and CNN's First Amendment rights; the shifting rationales behind the ban; and the administration's failure to follow the federal regulations that pertain to press passes, an alleged violation of Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nTuesday's lawsuit rejected the White House's claim that Acosta acted inappropriately at a press conference last week. The suit says this is really about Trump's dislike of Acosta.\n\nThe \"reasonable inference from defendants' conduct is that they have revoked Acosta's credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for plaintiffs' exercise of protected First Amendment activity,\" CNN's lawsuit alleges.\n\nMany media law experts, unaffiliated with CNN, believe the network has a very strong case.\n\nJudge Andrew Napolitano, the top legal analyst on Trump's favorite network, Fox News, said the same thing on Tuesday. \"I think this will be resolved quickly,\" he said, adding \"I think it will either be settled or CNN will prevail on motion.\"\n\nIf there is no settlement, CNN is requesting a jury trial.\n\nIn an interview with Wolf Blitzer, Boutrous said the government officials are being sued in their \"official capacity,\" but \"there is a possibility of damages claims,\" which would mean suing them personally.\n\nBlitzer pointed out that the officials would have to \"go out and hire their own attorneys.\"\n\nIt is incredibly rare to see a news organization suing a president.\n\nOther news organizations are now standing with CNN. In a statement Wednesday, The Associated Press, Bloomberg, First Look Media, Fox News, Gannett, NBC News, The New York Times, Politico, USA Today and The Washington Post, among others, said, \"Whether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions. It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons. Our news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this President, or any President. We will be filing friend-of-the-court briefs to support CNN's and Jim Acosta's lawsuit based on these principles.\"\n\nFred Ryan, the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, separately expressed his support for the action Tuesday night. \"We support CNN in its effort to restore the press credentials of its White House reporter,\" Ryan said. \"It is a journalist's role to ask hard questions, hold the powerful to account and provide readers with as much information as possible.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association is also backing CNN. The group said Tuesday that the president \"should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign tried to capitalize on the lawsuit with emailed survey on Wednesday that asked recipients if they think Acosta's ban was justified. The email subject line says, \"CNN SUES! Help Trump win.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Fox News and other outlets join fight over press access", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/FDoOMJIwRA4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "\"Fox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter's press credential,\" Wallace said. \"We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\"\n\nWallace added, \"While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\n\nFred Ryan, the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, also expressed his support for the action in a separate statement.\n\nHe said on Tuesday night, \"We support CNN in its effort to restore the press credentials of its White House reporter.

The Radio Television Digital News Association, which represents newsrooms across the country, called the revocation \"unconscionable.\"\n\nReporters and historians said it was hard to recall a similar episode.\n\n\"White House staff don't pull passes over personal pique, only over threats to the president,\" professor Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, told CNN.\n\nNo one is suggesting that Acosta threatened President Donald Trump. But right-wing websites and pro-Trump commentators alleged that Acosta mistreated a White House intern who tried to take a microphone away from him during the press conference.\n\nTrump's boosters used words like \"pushed\" and \"slammed.\" They screamed \"assault\" and \"abuse.\" Sanders cited this alleged \"inappropriate behavior\" to suspend Acosta's pass. But all of this is contradicted by the video, which shows Acosta holding onto the mic and saying \"pardon me, ma'am,\" when the intern tries to take it away.\n\n\"I was seated next to \u2066Acosta\u2069 at today's press conference and did not witness him 'placing his hands' on the young intern, as the White House alleges,\" Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason wrote on Twitter. \"He held on to the microphone as she reached for it.\"\n\nCNN's critics defend Acosta\n\nEven Chuck Ross of The Daily Caller, a website that harshly criticizes CNN, stood up for Acosta.\n\n\"Plenty to criticize Acosta about,\" Ross wrote, \"but he did not 'place his hands' on the intern. It's ridiculous for anyone to suggest he did.\"\n\nSanders defended her claim by posting a video on Twitter on Wednesday night. The same video was published about two hours earlier by Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large for the Infowars website.\n\nBoth Sanders and Watson used the clip to attack Acosta, but the 15-second video has been distorted to make Acosta look menacing.\n\nCNN said in a statement that Sanders \"lied\" on Wednesday night. \"She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened,\" CNN said. \"This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support.\"\n\nPress freedom groups also weighed in. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said Sanders' \"false description of the events leading up to it is insulting not only to the nation's journalists, but to its people.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association called the yanking of Acosta's pass \"out of line\" and \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"We urge the White House to immediately reverse this weak and misguided action,\" the association added.\n\nThe White House News Photographers Association's president Whitney Shefte issued a statement expressing outrage that Sanders \"may have shared a manipulated video.\"\n\n\"As visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth,\" Shefte said. \"It's deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country's highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\"\n\nRevoke credentials? 'I wouldn't do that'\n\nSenior journalists represented by the association also spoke up.\n\nHallie Jackson , of NBC, wrote on Twitter that the press corps \"should stand up against this.\"\n\nPeter Baker, of The New York Times tweeted, \"This is something I've never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996.\" Baker wrote that he believes Trump called on Acosta at the presser because \"he wants the confrontation.\"\n\nFalse predicate to punish a reporter. This is what the president wants. If he really thought @acosta was unfair, then why did he call on him? Because he wants the confrontation. https://t.co/Q78Nd88gPk \u2014 Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) November 8, 2018\n\nElisabeth Bumiller, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, said, \"The president should not pick and choose who covers him, and he should certainly not force out a representative of one of the country's leading news organizations.\"\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Trump's campaign refused to give press credentials to reporters from several major news outlets, including the Washington Post and BuzzFeed.\n\nWhen the issue came to a head in June 2016, Trump told CNN in an interview that, if elected, he would not revoke credentials. At the White House, \"it's a different thing,\" he said.\n\n\"When I'm representing the United States, I wouldn't do that,\" Trump added."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Read: Justice Department's response to CNN's lawsuit", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/P8Sb2ZSPwXs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Justice Department responded to CNN's lawsuit over the revocation of Jim Acosta's press pass on Wednesday, saying in a court filing that the White House rejects the idea that it can't pick and choose which journalists can be given a permanent pass to cover it.

Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiteer who quit Mays Cabinet earlier this year, led the charge. \"It is vassal state stuff,\" he told ITV News on Tuesday evening. \"Chuck it out.\"\n\nMay's Cabinet is deeply divided between hardline Brexit supporters and others who voted to remain in the EU. Downing Street hopes that she has done enough to convince her senior ministers that the draft text fulfills the result of the 2016 referendum and prevent a mass walkout that would imperil the deal.\n\nBut even if she can get it through her Cabinet, there's no guarantee that she can get it through parliament.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs prop up May's minority government, said it would not support it. Sammy Wilson, the party's Brexit spokesman, wrote on Twitter: \"All of the great and the good who were rolled out during the #EURef will be rolled out again in the coming weeks to try and get us to fall into line. We are clear -- we will not be voting for this humiliation!\"\n\nDeadlock broken\n\nThe conclusion of a draft deal with the European Union on Tuesday was a significant moment for May, ending months of deadlock.\n\nSenior officials in the UK and the rest of the EU had issued dire warnings of a no-deal scenario that could devastate the British economy.\n\nBut May's victory is only the beginning of what is expected to be a protracted and painful political process. Lawmakers in the UK won the right to a \"meaningful vote,\" which gives them the chance to accept or reject the Brexit deal.\n\nThey must also vote on the legislation that turns the text agreed with the European Union into UK law.\n\nOpponents take particular issue with the part of the agreement that deals with the border between Ireland, which remains in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the EU. Critics say the border agreement would, at least temporarily, tie the UK to the EU's trading rules without a way out.\n\n\"Without a clean exit clause, the United Kingdom would be handcuffed to the European Union with Brussels holding the keys,\" said DUP leader Arlene Foster.\n\nIreland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Wednesday that he wanted the Irish parliament to vote on the text of the Brexit deal, providing another potential obstacle for May in getting her deal across the line.\n\nIf the deal fails to jump the many political hurdles ahead, it would almost certainly be the end of May's career and Britain would plunge again into political chaos.\n\nWhile the British government and media have taken the Brexit deal as a breakthrough, EU officials have urged caution, pointing to the long political process that lies ahead.\n\nThe Cabinet meeting, scheduled for after Prime Minister's questions, will coincide with a gathering of ambassadors from the other 27 EU member nations in Brussels, who will also discuss the draft deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "US fires: 50 dead, families return to nothing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/ZMdjnvfjQuA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) More than 100 people are missing -- most of them senior citizens -- in Northern California's Butte County as firefighters battle the Camp Fire, the most deadly and destructive wildfire in state history, the sheriff's office says.\n\nThe Camp Fire is one of two major blazes burning in California that have left at least 50 people dead.\n\nMost of the 103 people listed missing by the Butte County Sheriff's Office are from Paradise, a town of 27,000 north of Sacramento first ravaged by the fire Thursday morning.\n\nAt least 73 of the missing are 65 or older.\n\nAn Alameda County coroner looks for human remains at a burned home in Paradise, California.\n\n\"In an effort to better inform the public, this list of reported missing persons is being provided,\" a message on the sheriff's website says. \"If you see anyone on the list who is no longer missing please contact us so their name can be removed.\"\n\nThe Camp Fire has killed at least 48 people since it began last week, and Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory L.

Authorities are trying to determine whether a third person, found dead at a burned home in Agoura Hills, also died as a result of that fire, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.\n\nand by Wednesday morning the San Bernardino County Fire District said. They've also been fighting a new blaze, the Sierra Fire, in San Bernardino County. It started late Tuesday about 50 miles east of Los Angeles near Rialto and Fontana,and by Wednesday morning had burned 147 acres , though no evacuations have been ordered,the San Bernardino County Fire District said.\n\nFire officials said the Sierra Fire was fanned by the Santa Ana winds -- strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area.\n\nWinds will be \"particularly strong\" Wednesday morning but are expected to weaken by evening, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMeanwhile in Northern California, forecasters have said the winds fueling the Camp Fire would slowly begin to decrease Wednesday and give firefighters a reprieve.\n\nResidents desperate to come back\n\nFor hours, Carmen Smith waited Tuesday at a roadblock outside Paradise, hoping someone would help her get home and retrieve her husband's medicine.\n\n\"I thought I was going to go home because I work at the hospital and we had to evacuate all the people, and I go, 'Oh, I'm coming back home,' but I did not know it was this bad,\" Smith told CNN affiliate KCRA . \"The fire was right there.\"\n\nSmith and others are wondering when they can go back to get medicine and clothing or simply to check on the damage.\n\n\"I don't know what to do here,\" Charles Terry told KCRA. \"I need to get that stuff out of the house.\"\n\nSome residents have returned to what's left of their gutted homes, but many have not.

Lt. Rawin Nasomsong, of the Royal Thai Police's Institute of Forensic Medicine, confirmed to CNN that 13-year old Anucha Tasako died as a result of a hemorrhage at the brain stem.\n\nThe boy's death has led to calls for reform to the sport, also known as Muay Thai, and its practice of using boys and young men -- sometimes as young as 8 years old -- to compete in professional bouts.\n\nTourism and Sports Minister Weerasak Kowsurat has vowed to introduce further legislation to the country's Boxing Act to protect young fighters, the Bangkok Post reports\n\nDeceased Muay Thai boxer Anucha Tasako first fought in the ring when he was 8 years old.\n\nThe amendment to the country's Boxing Act would ban all fighters younger than age 12, and require all those between 12 and 15 years old to be provided with safety equipment, especially head guards.\n\n\"This draft stipulates the criteria concerning ages of young people who want to compete in this sport,\" he said, adding that the Ministry \"will rush through the process to forward it to the cabinet for consideration as quickly as possible.\"\n\n'He died like a warrior'\n\nAnucha started practicing Muay Thai at the age of 7 or 8, said Damrong Tasako, the teenager's uncle who raised him from the age of 3. Tasako added the teen was \"very talented.\"\n\nThe young boy and his family are from Kalasin Province in the northeast of the country. He first fought in the ring when he was 8 years old, his uncle told CNN, winning his first match that came with a prize of 300 Thai Baht ($9 US). The prize money for his match on Saturday was 2,000 Thai Baht ($60 US).\n\nAnucha died as a result of a hemorrhage at the brain stem.\n\nAnucha wanted to train in Muay Thai because he wanted to earn money to buys things, said Tasako. To date, Anucha has taken part in an estimated 170 fights.\n\n\"His dream was he always wanted to be a champion at Lumpini Stadium or Ratchadamneon Stadium,\" he said, referring to the two main Muay Thai venues in Bangkok. \"Also, if he could he wanted to enter military cadet school.\"\n\nWhen asked about Anucha's death, his uncle said he didn't blame anyone. \"He died like a warrior. He was a fighter.\"\n\nA religious ceremony in honor of the teenager took place Wednesday in Samutprakarn Province, in central Thailand, where his final fight took place. His is body will be cremated Thursday.\n\nShining light on the issue\n\nActivists and doctors have tried several times to amend the child boxing bill, but their attempts have never been successful, said Dr. Witaya Sungkarat, chief of the Thai Child Boxers Research Project at Mahidol University, adding that the news of Anucha's death has just shone a big light on this issue again.\n\n\"We have never recommended a total ban of Muay Thai boxing,\" said Sungkarat. \"But we want them to avoid hitting the head of the child until they are at least 15 years old.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHis institute has carried out research scanning the brains of children who take part in Muay Thai and comparing them against children who don't.

The results were heeded by the new draft bill, which remains with the Ministry of Tourism and Sports Promotion to review, he added."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Erdogan: Audio recording of Khashoggi killing is a 'true disaster'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/duFDnxBpet8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An audio recording of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is a \"true disaster\" that \"shocked\" the Saudi intelligence officer who heard it, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.\n\nErdogan told reporters that after the intelligence officer had heard the recording, he said: \"I guess they were on heroin; only someone who is on heroin would do such a thing.\"\n\nThe comments, reported by the pro-government Turkish newspaper The Daily Sabah on Tuesday, came after The New York Times reported that people familiar with the audio recording say it contains an instruction to \"tell your boss.\" American intelligence officials believe is a reference to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince.\n\nThe report suggests that one of the 15-strong \"kill team\" allegedly sent to Istanbul to assassinate Khashoggi can be heard on the tape making a phone call in Arabic to say \"the deed was done,\" or words to that effect.\n\nThe same person also told the person on the other end of the line to \"tell your boss,\" a reference intelligence officials believe is the strongest evidence yet linking de facto Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Khashoggi's murder, according to the Times.\n\nJUST WATCHED What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?: A timeline Replay More Videos ...

It burned through 20,000 acres in less than 14 hours on Thursday. By Monday, it had reached 113,000 acres.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties doubled in size in a 90-minute period Friday morning, to 8,000 acres. By Monday morning, it was up to more than 91,500 acres. The Hill Fire in Ventura County has torched 4,531 acres.\n\nHere's why the fires are moving so quickly:\n\nPowerful winds\n\nIn Southern California, the Santa Ana winds pushing the fires are expected to remain strong in Ventura and Los Angeles counties through Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said Monday.\n\nIn fact, the strongest winds for Southern California may come Tuesday and could reach near-hurricane gale force, he said.\n\nThese winds, which began in the middle of last week, may last through the end of this week.\n\nIn Northern California, the offshore winds that had been whipping the area for days are expected to die down Monday, Hennen said. The classic offshore flow was similar to the Santa Ana winds.\n\nLack of rain, dry conditions\n\nThough the drought in California has eased somewhat, all of the state is still abnormally dry, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. That makes a lot of dry vegetation for the fires to burn.\n\nMore than half the state is in a moderate drought or worse and 18% of the state, including the area near the Woolsey Fire, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nOver the past month, much of the state has received less than 5% of its normal rainfall.\n\nTim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, said the Camp Fire is \"unique to be this late in northern California.\"\n\nNormally, a series of storms would have dampened the woods and brush by now, he said Friday at a news conference. But it hasn't rained much this fall, he said, creating \"mid-summer-like conditions.\"\n\n\"It kind of lined up perfectly to have the large 90,000-plus acre fire run we had (Thursday),\" Chavez said. \"Fuels will continue to get drier and drier and drier until we do finally get a season-ending rainfall event.\"\n\nThe terrain makes it hard for firefighters\n\nThe hills and canyons of Southern California are beautiful, but they can make it difficult for firefighters to gain access to wildfires.\n\nThe fire that broke out Friday near the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens occurred on a steep hillside that could not be accessed by firetrucks, so firefighters had to approach the fire on foot, CNN affiliate KCBS reported.\n\nThe canyons can accelerate fires. They act as funnels for the wind, which pushes already heated air upward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Family prays as they drive through wildfire Replay More Videos ...

That's contributing to more days of extreme fires, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nCalFire says the five most destructive fires in California history have occurred since 2015. The organization has been keeping statistics for 100 years. The list does not include the Camp Fire, which would top the list.\n\nAnd a Columbia University study released in 2016 says human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the Western United States over the last 30 years.\n\nCalifornia's fourth climate change assessment, issued last August, said the state's forests will become more vulnerable to wildfires because of climate change.\n\nThe assessment says that by the year 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77%.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the state's number of most-destructive fires that have occurred since 2015.

Her departure could portend another high-profile exit: chief of staff John Kelly, Nielsen's top advocate in the administration.\n\nTrump could ask Nielsen to resign in the coming days, multiple officials familiar with the matter predicted, describing the President's continued frustration at her handling of his signature issue: immigration and border security.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly is also on the list of possible resignations, despite Trump saying earlier this year he is welcome to stay in the post until the end of the President's term. Trump has been discussing a handful of replacements, including Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff. The President had a long conversation with him on midterm election night last week, and has grown to like him, two officials said, but they cautioned it is far from certain whether Trump will dismiss Kelly and elevate Ayers.\n\nAyers is not traveling with the vice president in Asia this week.\n\nIn recent weeks, the President has resumed polling advisers on potential replacements, as he did several months ago before ultimately announcing that Kelly would remain on as his chief of staff through his 2020 re-election campaign\n\nAyers has told at least two friends he is in the running for the position, but it's unclear whether he knows his true standing in the volatile West Wing. He has grown close to the President and key members of the administration, including the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and is valued for his political acumen -- something Trump allies have long grumbled that Kelly lacks.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House questioned how serious Ayers was under consideration. Other top aides, such as adviser Johnny DeStefano and budget director Mick Mulvaney, are also being discussed -- as well as others outside the administration.\n\nDeStefano has presided over a growing portfolio inside a White House known for its complicated internal dynamics. He started out overseeing of the Office of Presidential Personnel, and has since been placed in charge of the political shop and the Office of Public Liaison.\n\nA source close to Mulvaney said he is no longer interested in the chief of staff position.

Bush's administration, never overcame internal skepticism about her allegiance to Trump. She joined the administration as chief of staff to John Kelly, who was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary.\n\nWhen Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff, Nielsen followed, becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff.\n\nNielsen is widely viewed as an acolyte of Kelly, the retired Marine general who has his own complicated relationship with the President. Kelly has staunchly defended Nielsen against criticism of her performance on immigration-related matters. He's also been forced to defend her to the President, who has expressed suspicion over the jobs she held in the Bush administration.\n\nTrump has angrily aired his frustrations with Nielsen's handling of border security during contentious meetings at the White House, claiming she isn't up to the task of fulfilling the campaign promises he made to curb illegal immigration. That, in turn, has led to an internal dynamic where some officials have griped to the President about Nielsen's performance in order to gain favor with him.\n\nThe President has not sought to quell that dynamic, believing that pitting camps of aides against each other is a way to produce better results.

Since Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, he has overseen one of the most chaotic Cabinets in modern history -- with resignations, firings and the whispers of future resignations and firings an almost-daily story.\n\nThe latest: Trump has decided he wants Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, gone -- although it's unclear when she will go. Thrown into that mix is the fact that White House chief of staff John Kelly is very close to Nielsen -- she followed him into the DHS job -- and might take umbrage at her firing (or forced resignation) and step aside himself. Given the ongoing tensions between Trump and Kelly, it's hard to say that such a two-for-one scenario would bother the President.\n\nThere's a tendency to reach to normalize Trump's hot-knife-through-butter slicing and dicing of his Cabinet. After all, being a Cabinet secretary -- or a senior White House official -- is a very stressful job. And history suggests that people wear out and are replaced -- particularly after a major moment like a midterm election.\n\nBut, as with so many things when it comes to Trump, this tendency toward normalization undersells the historic anomaly we are witnessing.

Their energy, perspective and determination will reshape one of the power centers in a man's town. These are the stories of Badass Women all around Washington . \u2014 Dana Bash, Bridget Nolan, Rachel Smolkin & Abigail Crutchfield\n\n(CNN) Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers was Cathy McMorris when she was first elected to the House in 2004.\n\nThirty-five years old and single, she headed to Washington for a new powerful job as a Republican congresswoman from Washington state -- and didn't know if having a family would happen for her.\n\n\"I expected finding a husband, finding a partner would be even more difficult with me in this position,\" McMorris Rodgers remembers.\n\nTo be sure, not all women are looking for a partner. Not all women want to have children. But McMorris Rodgers did. And like so many working in any profession -- never mind in Congress -- she worried that adding mother to her title could pass her by.\n\nThe reality of a woman's biological clock is a theme we unwittingly began exploring with this series, after Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao bravely admitted to us that she felt as though she missed out on having children , and often tells younger women not to make the mistake she did of not thinking it through.\n\nBut that is not McMorris Rodgers' story. During her first term in Congress she met now husband Brian Rodgers at a barbeque back home in Spokane.\n\n\"I so admire Brian,\" she grins, speaking with CNN for a recent interview. \"He is confident in who he is. He knows what's important to him, and he's comfortable with me, and he supports me wholeheartedly.\"\n\nHistory Making Mom\n\nCathy McMorris Rodgers is now the only woman in history to give birth three times while serving in Congress. In fact, she was the first to do it twice as well.\n\nShe still remembers telling then-House Speaker John Boehner that she was pregnant with her third at age 44.\n\n\"He looked at me, and he's like 'really?'\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful it happened, I'm grateful to be a mom, and I feel like I came very close to missing on that,\" McMorris Rodgers says. \"And in some ways it's the hardest thing that I've ever done and yet I think it's the best thing that I have done.\"\n\nHer first pregnancy was easy, until the end. During a routine ultrasound doctors spotted a blockage called \" duodenal atresia \" and McMorris Rodgers was warned that one out of three babies with that disorder is born with Down Syndrome. Her son Cole was part of the one in three.\n\n\"When I got the news it was tough, it's just not what you expect and in that moment, it's overwhelming, and part of it is just the fear of the unknown,\" McMorris Rodgers explains. \"And I wondered how I would ever talk about it even, and yet today I'm grateful, I am grateful for Cole. He brings me such joy, I am grateful for the influence that he's had on my life.\"\n\nHaving a child with disabilities has opened her eyes not just as a mother, but a lawmaker. She has worked to pass legislation like the so-called ABLE Act, which allows people with disabilities to open tax free savings accounts to help pay for their care.\n\n\"It's given me a whole new purpose and a passion for what I do on Capitol Hill and I find a lot of fulfillment in just knowing that I'm making a difference, not just for Cole, but millions of others who just happen to have a disability,\" she says.\n\nBack into the fight\n\nShe says her husband Brian sometimes acts as a boxing coach, which can come in handy in Washington.\n\n\"I'll retreat to my corner, and he'll clean me up and encourage me and then send me back into the fight,\" she says.\n\nHer most recent fight? Seeking re-election in her eastern Washington state district, which was harder this time around than it had been for her in the past ( CNN projects she won with just over 55% of the vote ).\n\nAnd the House Republican Conference Chair -- the highest ranking Republican woman -- made the decision not to run again for Republican leadership, after Rep. Liz Cheney announced she would run for that position. McMorris Rodgers has since said she'll pursue a top position on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nStill, as we walk through her neighborhood in Spokane, she talks about growing up on a farm in Kettle Falls, Washington, where no one in her family had attended college. She was the first.\n\nAnd McMorris Rodgers remembers her 25-year-old self -- who had to be prodded to run for office in the first place.\n\n\"I had a lot of doubts and like a lot of women I told myself every reason why I shouldn't do it,\" she remembers.\n\n\"Some individuals who encouraged me, who saw something in me that I didn't see in myself and tapped me on the shoulder and say, 'Cathy, we think you should do it, we think you have something important to offer,' and I'm grateful for that,\" she adds.\n\nShe is hardly alone. Women, whatever their profession, tend to have a harder time feeling ready for a job, even though in most cases they are more than prepared.\n\n\"I think there's something in us that ... sometimes we're our own worst critic and instead of really focusing on what we have to offer and celebrating who we are, and our strengths, we can get caught up on the things we shouldn't be focusing on,\" she notes.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers is trying to make sure the new generation of women running for Congress has the help and the nudge that she appreciated so many years ago.\n\n\"I have made it a priority especially since I've been elected to Congress to reach out to other women and to do likewise because in recruiting women to run for office I hear them saying the same thing that I told myself,\" she says. \"And yet it's very important that they be encouraged to take that step.\"\n\nHow do you do it all? When will we stop asking?\n\nMcMorris Rodgers often is asked how she does it all. A key answer is that her husband, a retired naval commander, is now a stay-at-home father.\n\n\"He'll tell you it's harder than anything he did in the Navy,\" she says with a smile. \"And yet, I'm so grateful that he's doing that for our kids. He is carrying that load and being with them day in and day out. I mean it puts my heart at ease, those times when I am away longer than I would like to know that the kids are with Brian.\"\n\nShe is happy to serve as a role model for working moms, and hopes her story can inspire other women to follow in her footsteps.\n\n\"Whenever I talk to another woman whether they're married, or not, have kids, the first question they asked me is 'how do you do it?' And it's a lot of other people that make it possible, but if I can do it other women can do it,\" she says.\n\nBut McMorris Rodgers looks forward to the day when women like her aren't asked that question: how do you do it all?\n\n\"Men have done it one way and we become accustomed to the way that men may approach serving in Congress, having families, doing their roles. And women are going to do it a little different, and so it's still somewhat new,\" she explains.\n\n\"Sometimes we get caught up in how someone is doing it rather than just being focused on, wow she's she's getting it done, she's making a difference,\" she says.\n\nShe's admits -- that may take some time."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "CNN poll: Less than half of Democrats want Pelosi as the party's leader", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/XR1YaFQ3S6Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:21", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Almost three in five Americans said they'd prefer another Democrat as speaker of the House over past party leader Nancy Pelosi, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nAs Pelosi campaigns in the House to regain her title as speaker, Republicans and even some Democrats on Capitol Hill have mobilized against her.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants.

In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness, and 162 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "As more cases confirmed, CDC says evidence suggests 'viral association' for AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/E9Lz63t48Sg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:22", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There are 10 more confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis, a polio-like illness that mostly affects children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 in 27 states this year.\n\nThere are also 162 possible cases under investigation, 23 more than last week.\n\nAFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month, the CDC said that more than 90% of the 414 patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4, although adults can also develop AFM.\n\nThe agency released a report Tuesday that said 99% of children with confirmed AFM had experienced a viral illness with symptoms such as fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis.\n\nThe CDC also seems to be getting closer to determining a cause of the disease. According to the new report, \"Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic evidence to date suggest a viral association.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that the agency is \"not ruling anything out.\"\n\nIn the past two weeks, the agency has come under criticism from its own medical advisers for not zeroing in on a virus as a cause and instead also considering causes such as genetic disorders and environmental toxins.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany of the CDC's outside medical consultants have long thought that a virus -- specifically an enterovirus -- was most likely at the root of AFM.\n\nEnteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Though they're around all year long, they're most common in the summer and fall, which is also when AFM peaks.\n\nTypically, enteroviruses cause people to have cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and recovery is easy.\n\nSome of the patients whose cases are detailed in the new report tested positive for an enterovirus, but others have not, although it's not clear whether the testing was done in time to catch the presence of the virus.\n\nIt's unclear why a relatively small number of people develop paralysis after an enterovirus infection. Even within the same family, several siblings can develop the cold-like symptoms, but only one may become paralyzed.\n\nTwo weeks ago , four of the CDC's outside medical advisers on AFM expressed frustration to CNN that the agency insisted on casting its net wide, looking at genetic causes and possible environmental causes.\n\nThe experts felt that the agency shouldn't waste its time on those causes, which they said were highly unlikely, and instead should focus on a virus as the most likely reason behind AFM.\n\n\"I'm breathing a sigh of relief that they've acknowledged this,\" Dr. Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said of the CDC's new report. \"It's great.\"\n\nVan Haren said now the agency can move faster to figure out exactly which virus is causing the problem and how best to treat it.\n\nDr. Kenneth Tyler, a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM, agreed. \"I'm glad to see they're moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nBoth neurologists praised the CDC for becoming more communicative and responsive about AFM with doctors and patients over the past two weeks.\n\nJeremy Wilcox, a Virginia man whose son was diagnosed with AFM in September, also praised the agency for becoming more open.\n\nParents of children with AFM say that for years, their emails to the CDC went unanswered. Last week, Wilcox arranged a meeting between Dr. Anne Schuchat, the agency's principal deputy director, and more than a dozen parents of children with AFM.

Others that were surveyed included Handmade Burger Company and TGI Fridays, both of which were among several companies that do not publish nutrition information about their shakes.\n\nBattling obesity\n\nThe UK has been battling the rising tide of childhood obesity, with almost a third of children aged 12-15 overweight or obese. This is not only associated with social and psychological problems but also a host of serious diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer.\n\nIn August 2016, Public Health England (PHE) set out its approach to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by launching a structured sugar reduction program to remove sugar from everyday products. All sectors of the food and drinks industry were challenged to cut sugar content by at least 20% by 2020.\n\n\"Despite milkshakes being incorporated into Public Health England's sugar reduction program as part of the government's childhood obesity plan, it is clear from our survey that much more needs to be done than a 20% reduction, said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar. \"These very high-calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffer from tooth decay -- that is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe group is urging health authorities to go further by calling for mandatory traffic light colored nutrition labeling across all menus. In addition, the group has called for an outright ban on the sale of milkshakes containing more than 300 calories per serving.\n\nAccording to the charity's research, nine out of 10 milkshakes sold in UK supermarkets would be eligible for a red label for the excessive level of sugar they contain. Nevertheless, these products contained far less sugar than the freakshakes sold in fast-food outlets.\n\n\"Milkshakes can contain significant amounts of sugar,\" said Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE in response to the report. \"The food and drink industry -- including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers -- has a key role in helping to tackle this by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nA spokesman for Toby Carvery said: \"Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children.\"\n\nThe chain is \"very mindful of our role in helping guests make informed decisions\" and makes public the nutrition information for its menu, the spokesperson said.

As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09.\n\nThat suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit.\n\nWhy has the government been looking at this issue?\n\nFOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm.\n\nThe machines have been called the \"crack cocaine\" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems.\n\nThe government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a \"call for evidence\" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players.\n\nHow has the market reacted?\n\nInvestors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%.\n\nAfter the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said.\n\nWhat has been the political reaction?\n\nTom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken \"the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals\".\n\nHe added it was \"a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "TK Maxx and Amazon among shops selling real fur as faux", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46212094", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:45", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption A handbag from TK Maxx was made from fox fur, while shoes bought from the store online contained raccoon dog fur\n\nShops including Amazon and TK Maxx have been selling faux fur clothes and bags which are actually made from rabbit, fox and raccoon dog fur, a BBC Watchdog Live investigation has found.\n\nWidespread concern over animal cruelty has led to real fur very nearly disappearing from most UK high streets.\n\nBoth TK Maxx and Amazon said the products were no longer available.\n\nTK Maxx said it does not knowingly buy real fur and an error was made.

Here's what happened.\n\nMrs May's draft Brexit agreement was the only show in town - and Jeremy Corbyn went for it, despite the disadvantage - shared by everyone who is not in the cabinet or a select group of Tory backbenchers - of not having read it yet.\n\nHe branded the draft agreement a \"failure on its own terms\", based on what we know about it, that \"breaches the prime minister's own red lines\" and doesn't protect jobs and industry. He asked: \"Does she still intend to put a false choice to Parliament between her botched deal and no deal?\"\n\nThe PM accused Labour of wanting to \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nMr Corbyn quoted Jo Johnson who quit the government last week accusing the PM of a \"failure of statecraft\" of historic proportions - and said the EU's lead negotiator had reportedly told EU ambassadors \"the UK must align their rules with the EU, the EU will retain all the controls\".\n\nMrs May insisted she had negotiated a \"good deal\" for the UK that delivers on the referendum and ensures we \"take back control of our money, law and borders\".\n\nMr Corbyn turned to whether the UK can strike its own trade deals if it is in the temporary customs union as part of the so-called backstop to prevent the return of a hard Irish border.\n\nHe asked a briefly silent Commons (this is a point Tory Brexiteers are keen to get clarified too) whether her agreement would ensure the \"sovereign right of any UK parliament to unilaterally withdraw from any backstop\".\n\nMrs May said there needed be a backstop as an \"insurance policy\" but neither side wanted it it to be used.\n\nShe said she was \"aware of concerns\" that \"we don't want to be in a position where the European Union would find it comfortable to keep the United Kingdom in the backstop permanently and that's why any backstop has to be temporary\".\n\n\"I think that non-answer has confirmed that Parliament won't have that sovereign right,\" replied Mr Corbyn.

A series of pointed, well-delivered questions, including one on whether the UK could unilaterally leave the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement, which the PM danced around but didn't answer.\n\nThe prime minister was in the awkward position of discussing an as yet unpublished and unagreed document, and she looked uncomfortable and, at times, cornered.\n\nShe endured a very tough three quarters of an hour against opponents whose position was far more fluid than her's could be. I think we saw Jeremy Corbyn's position evolving a bit, before our very eyes.\n\nHis warning that Labour would not accept a choice between the PM's Brexit deal or a no-deal Brexit opens up the prospect of an attempt to present some further option. But what? A new round of negotiation?\n\nPerhaps accompanied by an extension to the Article 50 deadline for Brexit?\n\nHis aside that Labour respected the referendum verdict would seem to rule out a call for a second referendum. A number of his senior colleagues are attempting to waft him towards a very soft Brexit position, and maybe more; today they got some Remain body language.\n\nEven more ominous was the intervention that followed from Conservative Brexiteer backbencher Peter Bone.\n\nHe normally wraps his political messages in a joke - this time he delivered a blunt, to-her-face warning that the PM's deal was unacceptable. It's the kind of attack from the benches behind that has failed to materialise at previous PMQs that may be a feature of future ones.\n\nThe prime minister fielded questions about other issues - the horrible crossbow murder in Ilford, rolling stock in Elmet and Rothwell, viaducts in Eddisbury, disabled veterans and many more, but the Brexit questions kept coming.\n\nSeveral MPs quoted departed transport minister Jo Johnson at her, and the questions he raised will not go away.\n\nThe PM could swat away outright calls for another referendum, but the SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, zeroed in on the idea that Scotland should have a similar customs union deal to that offered for Northern Ireland, an idea which alarms Scottish Tories, while Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts used a Brexit question to take a swipe at the Labour-led Welsh government in Cardiff.\n\nAnd at the end of it all a series of points of order established that the PM will probably be back tomorrow (Thursday) for a full-dress Commons statement on the deal - if it gets through Cabinet.\n\nThis was a mere appetiser for what promises to be a gruelling \"til they drop\" ordeal."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: A guide to where we are", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46192884", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTheresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019. The reason the UK is leaving is because people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice and what post-Brexit relations will look like. A deal has been agreed by negotiators - it now has to get the stamp of approval from Theresa May's cabinet, then MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWill there really be a deal this week?\n\nNo. But there could be one next week if, as expected, EU leaders meet for a summit, which the Irish government says is set to happen on Sunday 25 November. MPs will then be given a few days to debate the deal, before voting on it some time before Christmas. Everything depends on Mrs May securing the backing of her cabinet first, however. She has told ministers - some of whom are very sceptical about her version of Brexit - that the agreement, while not perfect, is as good as the government can get.\n\nHave they solved the Irish border issue?\n\nThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nBut the two sides have not been able to agree how they can guarantee this - with the EU insisting on a \"backstop\" arrangement, which will kick in to avoid physical checks if whatever future trade deal the UK and EU agree does not manage to maintain the current open border.\n\nThe backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a \"hard border\" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.\n\nWhat else is in the agreement?\n\nIt has not been published yet so we don't know all the details. Leaks and briefings from EU sources suggest it will include:\n\nCommitments over citizens' rights after Brexit\n\nA proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure\n\nDetails of the so-called \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\"\n\nA decision point, in July 2020, on whether enough progress has been made to ensure an open Irish border after the post-Brexit transition ends. If not, the UK would be able to extend the transition period once, possibly until the end of 2021\n\nAnother option for the UK if the border issue isn't solved at the decision point will be going into a \"bare-bones\" customs arrangement. That would cover all of the UK but would keep Northern Ireland aligned more closely with the EU's customs rules and production standards\n\nWhat about a trade deal?\n\nA rough outline of a trade deal - what negotiators are calling a \"political declaration\" - will be published at the same time as the withdrawal agreement, but it will be much shorter. If all goes as planned, the details will be hammered out during the 21-month transition period, which is designed to bridge the gap between the UK officially leaving the EU and the new relationship kicking in.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nEven if she does get her top team to sign off the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it.\n\nShe does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, have already said they are likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nAll eyes are on the Brexiteers in the cabinet - will any of them resign in protest at the contents of the agreement? Ministers who have recently quit the cabinet claim the agreement will keep the UK under EU control and is not a proper Brexit.\n\nIf ministers back the agreement, focus will switch to the Commons vote.\n\nIf the only choice presented to MPs is Mrs May's version of Brexit or no-deal, it could frighten enough waverers into backing her. That's what Downing Street will be hoping. Labour and some Tories are trying to ensure other options are put to the vote as well.\n\nIf she loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope she will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Arlene Foster says DUP 'won't be led by anyone' on key draft text", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-46202568", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Arlene Foster: 'Concern about narrative' around Brexit draft\n\nThe DUP will \"not be led by the Irish government\" about coming to a view on the UK-EU draft Brexit text, Arlene Foster has said.\n\nShe was speaking after the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said unionists should be assured that the text would not negatively impact the integrity of the UK.\n\nThe DUP leader also said she hopes to meet the prime minister later.\n\nTalks have entered crunch time, with the Irish border the sticking point.\n\nTheresa May is still holding a special cabinet meeting discussing the detail of the text, and is due to make a statement outside Downing Street afterwards.\n\nEarlier, senior DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson had said the text could precipitate the break-up of the union.\n\nMrs Foster told reporters in the Commons: \"We're talking in a bit of a vacuum, we really do need to see that text.\"\n\n\"We are concerned about the narrative that has built up around the prime minister's proposal,\" she added.\n\n\"We will make our own judgements, and we will certainly not be led by the Irish government who have been aggressive in all of this.\"\n\nMrs Foster said if Theresa May reneged on commitments she had made, there would be \"consequences\".\n\nWhat's thought to have been agreed?\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement, which has been drawn up alongside a statement of future relations with the EU, has not been published, but is thought to run to some 500 pages.\n\nIt addresses the Northern Ireland backstop -

It's the next nearest star to the Sun after Alpha Centauri and Proxima Centauri - which are much better known.\n\nBarnard's Star is an extremely dim object known as a \"red dwarf\"; it's about 3% as bright as the Sun, emitting far less solar energy.\n\nThe planet orbits beyond a boundary called the \"snow line\", which is past the traditional habitable zone, where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\n\"On the surface, the temperature could be much higher...

This technique detects \"wobbles\" in a star which are likely to be caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles affect the light coming from the star. As the star moves towards the Earth its spectrum appears slightly shifted towards the blue and, as it moves away, it is shifted towards the red.\n\nTeam members re-examined archive data obtained over a 20-year period, and added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nThis wealth of data provided the accuracy needed to identify the planet to a high degree of certainty. This is the first time this technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nWhen the new generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will probably include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet.

According to Prof Godfray he was \"explicitly asked\" not to look at the effectiveness of the current culls.\n\nInstead Prof Godfray and his team drew on the results of the Randomised Badger Control Trials carried out between 1998 and 2007.\n\nNatural boundaries\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nThese showed that culling tended to increase TB in badgers because of increased movement.\n\nIt did, however, find that a reduction of between 12% and 16% in the rate of new cases of cattle TB was theoretically possible, but with significant caveats: the culling had to be carried out over a large area with natural boundaries for between eight to twelve days each year for four years and that more than 70% of badgers had to be killed.\n\nSince culling began in 2013, scientists and campaigners have expressed concerns that the culls that have been rolled out by Defra have not been in accordance with the strict criteria set out by the expert group because they have proved too expensive or too difficult.\n\nThey say that improperly conducted trials could actually increase cattle TB rates.\n\nBut Prof Godfray notes that, in principle, culling is one of the tools ministers have at their disposal and it should be up to them whether its marginal benefit was worthwhile.\n\n\"We conclude that culling does have an effect on the disease. The phrase we use is 'a real but modest effect',\" he said.\n\n\"If nothing else is involved then one would obviously cull, because if one does not cull one is throwing away one of the tools. But of course there are many other factors involved.\"\n\nAnother argument Prof Godfray puts forward in favour of culling is that it makes affected farmers more amenable to carry out unpopular and costly disease control measures on their farms and in transporting their cattle.\n\n\"It is likely that the farming industry would be more willing to accept other interventions that could negatively affect dairy and beef profitability if they believed that the threat of transmission from badgers was being robustly addressed,\" he said.\n\nThe report warns however that continued culling \"would not be acceptable to some (possibly large) sections of the public, and the costs of policing could be substantial\" and says that a shift away from culling is \"highly desirable\".\n\nSpecifically, it emphasises the need for a proper evaluation of badger vaccination.\n\nTesting regime\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nProf Godfray's report also states that infections from cattle to cattle is higher than had been thought, possibly because the current so called skin test used to test for the disease is less reliable than experts once believed. It therefore urges that Defra adopts more sensitive tests.\n\nThe farming minister welcomed the report and said that Defra would give its response by next summer.\n\n''We welcome this review of the government's 25-year Bovine TB strategy and I extend my thanks to Sir Charles Godfray and his team for their hard work in producing the report.\n\n\"Sir Charles' report is an important contribution that will inform next steps in the strategy to achieve officially TB free status for England by 2038.''\n\nProf Rosie Woodroffe of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said that the report had many good ideas but said nothing about the effectiveness of the current badger culls.\n\n\"The report contains little critical evaluation of whether the current farmer-led culls are effectively reducing cattle TB,\" she said.\n\n\"It reports results from the first two years of monitoring without mentioning any of the caveats included by the original authors. It makes no mention of more recent data, which have suggested incidence might be falling in two areas but rising in a third.\"\n\nProf Lord John Krebs from Oxford University, who led the Randomised Badger Control Trials, said that the report indicated that Defra and farmers need to do more if cattle TB is to be stamped out.\n\n\"Currently, much of the spread of TB in cattle arises from a combination of disappointingly low uptake of measures to prevent cattle coming into contact with badgers, trading of infected cattle, and the low sensitivity of the standard skin test for TB, which means that there is likely to be a hidden reservoir of infection in many cattle herds in high risk areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless the government and the farming industry tackle these problems now, TB will not be eradicated or controlled.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Nation\u2019s Tourists Announce Plans To Form Circle, Clap Hands Around Guys Doing Flips And Stuff", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-tourists-announce-plans-to-form-circle-clap-h-1830439968", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK\u2014Excitedly gathering for a good view, the nation\u2019s tourists announced plans Wednesday to form a wide circle around a group of guys who were doing a bunch of flips and stuff. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely thrilled to stand here and clap our hands along with that guy cradling a boombox, cheering them on as they spin around and do backflips over things,\u201d said a spokesperson for the nation\u2019s tourists, adding that they looked forward to nodding their heads along to the sound of bucket drumming. \u201cFurthermore, we will repeat this process in every city we visit, capturing all the crazy dance moves on our phones to later post on social media with a caption that says something like \u2018Only in NYC.\u2019 This also extends to the silver-painted man who is standing completely still, who we\u2019ll approach individually until we\u2019re startled by his sudden, rigid movements.\u201d The tourists concluded their statement by revealing plans to disperse the circle and flee the scene right when the guys began passing around the donation hat.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Female Director Asked If She Feels Comfortable Filming Scene While Nude", "article_link": "https://entertainment.theonion.com/female-director-asked-if-she-feels-comfortable-filming-1830439638", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES\u2014In a concentrated effort to ensure the movie set felt like a safe, supportive place for all those involved, sources confirmed Wednesday that a female director was asked if she felt comfortable filming a scene while nude. \u201cI just wanted to do a quick check with you to make sure you\u2019re comfortable with this,\u201d said producer Neil Forester, adding that the scene could be shot behind closed doors if prying eyes made her feel uncomfortable and even suggesting some shots could be completed using a stand-in director. \u201cWe\u2019ll just need you to disrobe for a moment so you can get the shot the way it deserves to be filmed.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:11", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Mattis Defends Mexico Border Deployment in First Troop Visit", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/mattis-defends-mexico-border-deployment-in-first-troop-visit/4658451.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:18", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis defended the deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico as he travelled there on Wednesday, saying the mission was \u201cabsolutely legal\u201d and justified, and that it was improving military readiness.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s politically charged decision to send U.S. troops to the Mexico border came ahead of U.S. midterm congressional elections last week, as Trump sought to strengthen border security as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters, including Republicans in Congress, have embraced the deployment.\n\nBut critics have assailed the decision, calling it a political stunt to drive Republican voters to the polls. They have scoffed at Trump\u2019s comparison of caravans of Central American migrants, including women and children, to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nMattis, speaking to a small group of reporters travelling with him, rejected criticism and said the deployment was the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that support to border police or border patrol is necessary right now,\u201d Mattis said, noting that that was the assessment of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHe added the deployment was deemed legal by Trump administration attorneys and was improving readiness by giving troops more experience in rapid deployment.\n\nThe visit took Mattis near the Texas town of Donna, where U.S. troops have set up a base camp near a border crossing point with Mexico. General Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, greeted him as he landed.\n\nMattis said U.S. soldiers were making rapid progress erecting barriers along the border and estimated the first, construction phase of the U.S. military effort could be completed within 10 days.\n\n\u201cI would anticipate with what we\u2019ve been asked to do so far, probably within a week to 10 days, we\u2019ll have done what\u2019s needed,\u201d Mattis told the reporters. \u201cOf course, it will be a dynamic situation and there will be new requests coming in.\u201d\n\nMattis said the U.S. military was also rehearsing helicopter operations to help support U.S. border personnel, potentially flying them to new locations if the caravans of migrants shift direction.\n\nThe deployed U.S. troops are not expected to directly interact with migrants, most are unarmed, and they are only assigned tasks that support U.S. border personnel, including building temporary lodging.\n\nSCRUTINY FROM CONGRESS\n\nTrump\u2019s Democratic opponents have threatened to investigate the matter once they take control of the House of Representatives early next year after gaining a majority in the House in the midterm elections.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, told Reuters that Trump had used the military \u201cas a prop to stoke fear and score political points.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will soon be finally able to conduct oversight of this gross abuse and the President\u2019s many failed border security policies,\u201d said Thompson, who is expected to lead the committee when the Democrats take control of the House .\n\nIt is unclear how long the deployment will last. Mattis initially authorized it through mid-December but it could be extended.\n\nMattis estimated about 5,900 troops were participating in the border mission. The U.S. military has offered a breakdown accounting for 5,600 of them, estimating about 2,800 troops in Texas, 1,500 in Arizona and another 1,300 in California.\n\nAsked whether troops\u2019 families should expect their loved ones to remain deployed through Thanksgiving or even Christmas, Mattis declined to speculate.\n\n\u201cWe are a 365-day-a-year military. Rain or Shine. Light or dark. Cold weather or hot weather,\u201d he said, declining to estimate costs of the deployment until he had better data.\n\nTrump railed against illegal immigration to win the 2016 presidential election and has shown no signs of easing up on the issue in the wake of last week\u2019s vote.\n\nLast week, he effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, seeking fresh ways to block thousands of Central Americans travelling in caravans from entering the United States.\n\nMattis compared the mission to other deployments in the past, largely comprised of U.S. National Guard, during Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n\u201cWe determined that the mission was absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\u201d Mattis said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing new under the sun.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "FOX News, Others Back CNN in Fight to Regain White House Press Pass", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fox-news-others-backscnn-in-fight-to-regain-white-house-press-pass-/4658352.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:18", "body_paragraphs": "Several major news organizations announced they would throw their weight behind CNN's legal efforts to regain White House press credentials for their reporter Jim Acosta, including rival network FOX News.\n\n\n\n\"Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\" FOX News president Jay Wallace said in a statement. \"While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\n\n\n\nA coalition of news organizations, including Bloomberg, USA Today, the Associated Press and others announced in a joint statement they would file \"friend-of-the-court\" briefs that supported CNN's lawsuit against the White House.\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has dismissed the lawsuit as \"more grandstanding from CNN,\" saying the administration stands by its decision to revoke Jim Acosta's credentials.\n\n\"After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions \u2014 each of which the President answered \u2014 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.

The legal opinion cited more than 160 instances in which a U.S. president has appointed non-Senate confirmed officials to temporarily fill high-level positions.\n\nThe eastern state of Maryland on Tuesday challenged the legality of Trump's appointment of Whitaker, saying it violated federal law and that Rosenstein should be installed to follow what it said would be the agency's normal succession rules.\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said the state is challenging the Whitaker appointment on two grounds, claiming Justice Department succession rules called for Rosenstein to become attorney general and that Whitaker, as the agency's \"principal officer,\" must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"The Attorney General's succession statute and the Constitution protect the country against exactly what President Trump has attempted to do here \u2014 pluck an unqualified and unconfirmed partisan to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer in order to protect himself rather than the rule of law,\" Frosh said in a statement."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Overheating Machines Complicate Florida's Recount Battle", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/overheating-machines-complicate-florida-s-recount-battle/4658266.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:21", "body_paragraphs": "Florida\u2019s election recount drama is intensifying as lawyers return to court and tallying machines break down ahead of a Thursday deadline to complete reviews of the senate and governor races.\n\nMuch of the trouble centers on the Democratic stronghold of Palm Beach County, where tallying machines have overheated. That\u2019s caused mismatched results with the recount of 174,000 early voting ballots, forcing workers to go back and redo their work with no time to spare.\n\nA mechanic was flown in to fix the problems, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have a lot of assurances,\u201d Palm Beach County Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher told WPTV Tuesday night. Bucher did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Democrats planned to ask a federal judge on Wednesday to set aside the state law mandating that mailed-in votes be thrown out if the signature on the envelope doesn\u2019t match the signature on file with election authorities.\n\nThe developments are sure to fuel frustrations among Democrats and Republicans as the recount unfolds more than a week after Election Day. Democrats have urged state officials to do whatever it takes to make sure every vote is counted. But Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have argued without evidence that voter fraud threatens to steal races from the GOP.\n\nThe state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, both run by Republican appointees, have said they have seen no evidence of voter fraud. A Broward County judge challenged anyone who has evidence of fraud to file a report.\n\nAs it all plays out, the Republican candidates for governor and Senate, Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott, still hold the narrowest of leads over their Democratic counterparts, Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson.\n\nWhile the counting goes on, there are now four lawsuits pending in a Tallahassee federal court that seek to throw out ballot counting rules or extend the Thursday 5 p.m. deadline for recounts.\n\nMarc Elias, a campaign attorney for Nelson, argued ahead of the looming court battle that \u201cwe should all be able to agree that the goal here is a legal and accurate count.\u201d Republicans have responded by contending that Democrats want to bend or skirt existing election laws to alter the outcome.\n\n\u201cWe got to keep the heat on these people to make sure they follow the law,\u201d said Republican U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney to reporters on a recount update organized by Scott\u2019s campaign.\n\nAt the Broward County elections center, about 30 workers gathered around a dozen counting machines counting ballots on Wednesday morning. The process resembled feeding documents into a photocopier - they placed stacks into feeders, which run through about two or three ballots per second. Then workers grab another stack and repeat the process.\n\nTrump on Tuesday called on Democratic Nelson to admit that he lost his re-election bid.\n\n\u201cWhen will Bill Nelson concede in Florida?\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThe characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u2018find\u2019 enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\u201d\n\nPresidents have historically sought to rise above the heated partisan drama surrounding election irregularities. Former President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t so publicly involved when a recount and legal process in the 2008 election delayed a Democrat taking a Minnesota Senate seat until July 2009. Former President Bill Clinton struck a lower tone during the 2000 presidential recount, which also centered on Florida.\n\nBut this Florida recount has been personal for Trump. He aggressively campaigned in the state, putting his finger on the scales of the Republican gubernatorial primary this summer by endorsing DeSantis. After Election Day, Trump\u2019s aides pointed to the GOP\u2019s seeming success in the state as a validation that the president\u2019s path to re-election remained clear \u2014 a narrative that has grown hazier as the outcomes have become less certain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said Tuesday the president \u201cobviously has his opinion\u201d on the recount.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly frustrating to watch,\u201d she said.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is attempting to bully Florida election officials out of doing their jobs. Schumer and Nelson, both Democrats, spoke with reporters Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just plain wrong. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing and lying about the vote in Florida, and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scale of justice.\u201d\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed DeSantis ahead of Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the machine recount is complete, a hand recount will be ordered in any race where the difference is 0.25 percentage points or less, meaning it could take even longer to complete the review of the Senate race if the difference remains narrow.\n\nIf the Senate race does go to a hand recount, the deadline for counties to finish is Sunday. But two of the pending four lawsuits ask that a federal judge delay the deadlines so that all counties can finish processing the crush of ballots.\n\nElias argued that there\u2019s no need to rush, since the winner of the Nelson-Scott race won\u2019t be sworn into office until January."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Publisher: NYT Reporters Work on Book About Brett Kavanaugh", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/publisher-nyt-reporters-work-on-book-about-brett-kavanaugh/4658181.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:21", "body_paragraphs": "Two journalists who helped cover the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh are working on a book about the newest Supreme Court justice.\n\n\n\nPortfolio says Wednesday that it has a deal with New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin for \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh.\"\n\n\n\nThe publisher says the book will focus on the \"many unanswered questions\" about Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual harassment and assault stemming from his years in high school and college.

This field deep within in West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest looks more like a Game of Thrones battleground than a woodlands restoration project.\n\nThis is how Chris Barton is bringing forests back to Appalachia's old strip mines: with a bulldozer tearing up the soil with meter-long metal teeth.\n\n\"We've had a lot of people kind of look at us twice,\" he laughed.\n\nBarton is a forest scientist at the University of Kentucky. On these former mines, he's found that before he can plant a forest, he has to ravage a field.\n\n\"The really interesting thing is, after we do it, there's no question that that was the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nMore on that later. First, Barton's work lies at a crossroads for Appalachia, and for much of the world.\n\nNot rocket science\n\nCoal mines have stripped away roughly 400,000 hectares of Appalachian forests.\n\nBurning coal for energy is adding more and more planet-warming carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. As the planet heats up, experts warn that simply cutting greenhouse gas emissions won't be enough to prevent potentially catastrophic levels of global warming. CO2 must also be removed from the atmosphere.\n\nCurrently, experimental machines that pull CO2 directly from the air are too expensive to be practical.\n\nHowever, a new report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says effective carbon-removal technology already exists.\n\nIt's not rocket science. It's forests.\n\nThe report says planting trees and managing forests, along with carbon-absorbing farming and ranching practices, are among the most cost-effective strategies that are ready for large-scale use today.\n\nTaking advantage of these natural systems could take care of more than a third of the greenhouse gas reductions needed to prevent devastating climate change, according to another recent study.\n\nTurning red spruce loose\n\nIn Appalachia, no ecosystem is better at capturing carbon dioxide than red spruce forests.\n\nThey're even better than hardwood forests, according to Forest Service soil scientist Stephanie Connolly.\n\nThat's because when deciduous trees lose their leaves in the fall, \"photosynthesis shuts down and the trees go dormant,\" she said.\n\nRed spruce is an evergreen. It continues to photosynthesize and pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere all winter long.\n\nWhen evergreen needles do fall, they decompose more slowly than deciduous leaves, she added. And the year-round shade provided by evergreens keeps the soil cool and decomposition slow.\n\nPlus, these forests are more than just carbon sinks. They also absorb water during heavy rains, preventing flooding; and their soils release water during droughts. They provide habitat for rare species like the Cheat Mountain salamander and the northern flying squirrel.\n\nAppalachia has lost 90 percent of the roughly 200,000 hectares of red spruce forest that once blanketed its mountains. Barton, the Forest Service, and a host of partners are working to return red spruce habitat to a thousand-hectare tract of the Monongahela that was strip-mined in the 1980s.\n\nStuck\n\nBut there's a problem with many of these lands.\n\nAfter the mines closed, they were restored according to best practices of the time. The leftover rock from mining was packed down to prevent erosion and planted with shallow-rooted grass.\n\n\"That's fine for stability,\" Barton said. \"But for plant life, if you went out and planted trees in these sites, they just didn't grow. The ground was way too compacted. Water didn't infiltrate. Roots can't penetrate. Oxygen can't circulate in those environments.\"\n\nDecades later, lands that had been strip-mined and reclaimed were \"stuck.\" Nothing but grass could grow on them.\n\nBarton figured that ripping up the compacted soil would \"unstick\" them.\n\nBut it wasn't an easy sell.\n\nJack Tribble was a new forest ranger at Monongahela when Barton and Green Forests Work approached him. Tribble had already tried and failed to get trees to grow on the site.\n\n\"These guys came to us and said, 'You need to rip this,'\" he said. \"Of course, that doesn't make sense at all to me.\"\n\nBut he approved a 30-hectare trial plot and crossed his fingers.\n\n\"We [had] a piece of equipment the size of a dozer out there ripping the ground,\" he said. \"That's just kind of a scary thing.\"\n\nThat was 2011. Seven years later, he said, \"these trees are just growing really, really well.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" he added. \"I totally get it.\"\n\nCost benefit\n\nThis kind of reforestation is not cheap. Tribble said it costs roughly $5,000 per hectare. He estimates that restoring the most critical areas will add up to about $4 million.\n\nPartnerships with the Nature Conservancy, American Forests, the Arbor Day Foundation and many others have helped with know-how and fundraising.\n\nPlus, he added, the effort is spending money and hiring locally.\n\nBarton said that's an important part of what Green Forests Work is about.\n\nIn Appalachia, where the declining coal industry is shedding jobs, he said, \"the idea was to build an ecological program to restore forests, but also, at the same time, develop an economic program for Appalachia, by putting people to work.\"\n\nRestoration projects need heavy equipment operators. Locals collect seeds from native plants, and local nurseries grow the seedlings. So far, Barton says the Monongahela project has poured about $1 million into the community.\n\nSince 2009, Green Forests Work has planted nearly 2.5 million trees on roughly 1,600 hectares of what used to be strip mines across Appalachia.\n\nIn West Virginia alone, Connolly said, restoring red spruce to its old habitat could lock up the equivalent of 56 million barrels of oil.\n\nNot right away. It takes decades.\n\nNature works slowly. But it works."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Juul Labs to Pull Sweet E-Cig Flavors to Curb Youth Use", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/juul-labs-to-pull-sweet-e-cig-flavors-to-curb-youth-use/4657198.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:23", "body_paragraphs": "Juul Labs, the U.S. market leader for electronic cigarettes, said on Tuesday it will pull popular flavors such as mango, cucumber and fruit from retail store shelves in an effort to reduce surging teenage use of its products.\n\nThe move comes as Juul and other e-cigarette makers have faced heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration amid a sharp increase by high school students in use of the devices, which look like a USB flash drive and vaporize a flavored liquid containing nicotine.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Juul Chief Executive Kevin Burns said the company wants to be \"the off-ramp for adult smokers to switch from cigarettes, not an on-ramp for America's youth to initiate on nicotine.\"\n\nJuul said it will stop selling flavors except for tobacco, mint and menthol in all retail outlets, including convenience stores and vape shops, until retailers can install technology that scans buyers' IDs to independently verify they are 21 or older.\n\nUntil then, popular fruit flavors and other sweet flavors that appeal to younger users will only be available on Juul's website. The company said it uses an age-verification system that requires buyers to enter their social security number, address and birth date, which is verified by a third-party service.\n\nIn addition, the company said it is shutting down its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook, and working with social media companies to remove \"unauthorized, youth-oriented content on their platforms\" relating to Juul.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter that \"voluntary action is no substitute for regulatory steps FDA will soon take,\" but he acknowledged Juul's actions and urged other e-cigarette makers to take steps to reduce use by minors.\n\n'Juul rooms'\n\nSome of Juul's early social media and Youtube videos included images of attractive young people using the product.\n\nUser-generated social media about Juul became popular over the last two years, with young people posting videos and photos of themselves using the product at school or with friends, often under the hashtags #doit4juul or #juullife.\n\n\"Juuling\" has become synonymous with vaping in high schools across the country, where some teachers and administrators have started locking bathrooms, jokingly called \"Juul rooms\" by students.\n\nThe FDA in September threatened to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors. The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that has now ended.\n\nThe agency is expected to announce restrictions on flavored e-cigarette products this week that mirror those suggested by Juul and other manufacturers. A senior agency official last week said the FDA plans to only allow sales of tobacco, mint and menthol flavors in convenience stores and gas stations. Other flavors could still be sold at vape shops.\n\nChanges by companies\n\nJuul said that beginning in early 2017 it required models used in advertisements of its products be older than 35. Earlier this year, it began featuring only former cigarette smokers in its ads to highlight smoking cessation benefits.\n\nJuul has grabbed significant U.S. market share over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nMarlboro maker Altria Group Inc, which sells e-cigarettes under the MarkTen brand, last month said it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to FDA's concerns. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.\n\nJames Campbell, a spokesman for the Imperial Brands Plc unit that makes blu e-cigarettes, said the company told the FDA it plans to introduce a technology early next year that would lock devices in an effort to prevent underage use. The company also said it would review its flavors and packaging to minimize youth appeal, strengthen age verification for online sales and terminate contracts with retailers found to sell to minors.\n\nMichael Shannon, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Vapor, a unit of British American Tobacco, said last week the company planned to tell the FDA it would penalize retailers that sell to youth and strengthen online sales restrictions to prevent underage or large bulk purchases of its products."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "WHO Official Predicts 6 More Months Battling Ebola in Congo", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/who-official-predicts-6-more-months-battling-ebola-in-congo/4656814.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:24", "body_paragraphs": "The emergencies chief for the World Health Organization predicted Tuesday that Congo\u2019s Ebola outbreak will last at least another six months, saying that informal health facilities have become \u201cmajor drivers\u201d of the current, deadly transmission.\n\nDr. Peter Salama said that makeshift \u201ctradi-modern\u201d health centers \u2014 offering both traditional and modern treatment \u2014 were believed to be linked to more than half of cases in Beni, the largest city affected by the current outbreak that has taken more than 200 lives.\n\nSalama, who returned from a trip to Ebola-hit eastern Congo last week, said Tuesday it appeared \u201cvery likely\u201d that some cases of Ebola had been misdiagnosed as malaria, because early symptoms are virtually identical.\n\nHe said that the WHO is planning on \u201cat least another six months before we could declare this outbreak over.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, people appeared to have contracted Ebola while visiting the centers for other health concerns, Salama said.\n\nHe described the \u201ctradi-modern\u201d centers as popular but unregulated neighborhood facilities that vary from stand-alone structures to \u201cjust a room in someone\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nSalama noted how many residents appear suspicious of foreigners, officials and outside organizations, but that many also believe in the effectiveness of injectable medicines.

I gotta ask God, \u2018Why, God, do you allow this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \u201ca church for imperfect people.\u201d\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \u201cDo those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\u201d\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like this person. There is a way out.\u201d\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man\u2019s grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\u201cThey lost one of ...\u201d Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \u201cThey lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker\u2019s for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They\u2019d drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn\u2019t ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cYou come as you are, whether you\u2019re struggling, or whether you don\u2019t believe, or whether you\u2019re just curious.\u201d\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\u201cI have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI\u2019ve got folks that overdosed the night before. I\u2019ve got folks who have lost everything.\u201d\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peets said.\n\n\u201cSurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you\u2019re your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\u201d he told Peets. \u201cSo what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\u201d\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \u201cCHAPLAIN\u201d on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren\u2019t home or weren\u2019t answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it\u2019s about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \u201cif you save one life, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine\u2019s friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey\u2019s suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he\u2019ll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\u201d\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\u201cI shoot heroin daily,\u201d Sessine explained a few minutes later, \u201cand it\u2019s coming to the point where enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \u201clove people back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend and I, we made a deal,\u201d Casey said, his voice catching. \u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Promise me we\u2019ll never stop getting our hands dirty,\u2019 And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\u201cWhen we approach the people on the street, whether they\u2019re addicted, whether they\u2019re even drunk, or whether they\u2019re high at the moment or they\u2019re a prostitute, whatever\u2019s going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\u201d Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev. Antonio Maria Diez de Medina, the pair greeted men on a street corner, a mom on her front steps and kids on scooters. Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThere been a few times where I\u2019ve come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, \u2018Hi. How are you? How you doing,\u2019\u201d Siniscalchi says. \u201cThey kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\u201d\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets. The rubber-wheeled cart sports a Jesus flag and a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a resonant image in a city with a robust Hispanic population.\n\nAfter two years, the sight of robed men with long beards chatting up people barely draws second glances. Quite a few people chat.\n\nOn one walk, a middle-aged bicyclist asked, \u201cYou guys Catholics or something?\u201d He then had his silver crucifix blessed. A passing woman took a blue plastic crucifix that matched her clothes. At one point, Siniscalchi sat down next to a downcast woman, pulled out a crucifix and told her Jesus loves her.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, looking down.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t matter, he said, Jesus does.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the friars said goodbye to go greet more souls."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Soft Wearable Tech is Helping People Move", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4657868.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:25", "body_paragraphs": "Robots with rigid metal frames are being used to help the paralyzed walk and have applications that could one day grant military fighters extra power on the battlefield.

The Magen David Adom medical service said a man in his 40s was found dead under the rubble of a building in Ashkelon.\n\nHe was the first casualty in Israel from the current wave. The man was later identified as a man from Hebron, the West Bank\u2019s largest Palestinian city.\n\nThe eruption of fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war. But he will now be under intense pressure to retaliate given Hamas\u2019 unrelenting rocket barrages.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, marking an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. A 19-year-old soldier was critically wounded and rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation fire quickly ensued.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn Tuesday after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli warplanes, tanks and naval vessels were involved in strikes against military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the attacks \u2014 Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.\n\nHe said the Israeli military has enhanced its deployment along the border but had yet to mobilize its reserves. He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza\u2019s economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers.

At least two people have died in that wildfire.\n\nIn Northern California, 48 people were confirmed dead Tuesday night after the Camp fire ripped through the town of Paradise.

No one was hurt in the blaze, since the camps were evacuated late Thursday, along with their Torah scrolls, camp director Seth Toybes told HuffPost in an email late Tuesday night.\n\nSince 1952, generations of Jewish Americans have attended the Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps, forging lifelong friendships and memories while learning how to be proud of their religious traditions. The camps became a prototype for other Jewish summer camps across the nation.\n\nThe camps were the brainchild of the temple\u2019s Rabbi Alfred Wolf, a prominent Jewish and interfaith leader who escaped Germany in 1935 as anti-Semitism was rising in his homeland. In 1950 he rented Presbyterian facilities and organized a summer camp for Jewish youths in Los Angeles.\n\nThe rented camp had many crosses on its property. So when Wolf opened Camp Hess Kramer at its current location in 1952, its leaders erected wooden menorahs around the site. Toybes said that through this ancient Jewish symbol, the leaders wanted to remind campers that \u201cthis was a safe place for Jews to be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States granted Jews freedoms of practice that stood in stark contrast to Nazi Germany and our founders were proud of that,\u201d Toybes said.\n\nOver the years, the camps also became a beloved retreat for non-Jewish youths \u2015 including young leaders in the Chicano movement of the 1960s.\n\nThe Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps\u2019 menorah before the fire:\n\nMany of the wooden menorahs erected around the site, including Camp Hess Kramer\u2019s last surviving original menorah, were destroyed in the fire, Toybes said. He added that the metal and concrete outdoor menorah likely survived because it was built to withstand the elements.\n\nOver the years, that menorah has become a symbol of the camp community.\n\n\u201cThe menorah stands on our hillside as a symbol to our campers, staff and others that we are Jewish and proud of this,\u201d Toybes said.\n\nIn the wake of the Woolsey fire, he said, he thinks the menorah is helping the community rally together.\n\n\u201cI believe that people are not only feeling inspired that it survived the blaze but emboldened to rebuild this space that has meant so much to so many, Jews and non Jews alike over the years,\u201d Toybes wrote.\n\nAlumni of the camps have been posting on social media to mourn the destruction and reminisce about their time there.\n\ni spent several summers at #CampHessKramer as a kid. this is absolutely devastating and it\u2019s amazing that the menorah is still standing. it\u2019s a beacon of hope and a reminder of our toughness. we will come back from this...we always do. #WoolseyFire #California https://t.co/cvlHuaP2Z9 \u2014 jessica b (@pennylane586) November 12, 2018\n\nSo sad..generations of Jewish families remember this camp with great fondness, including me and my son.. \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) November 13, 2018\n\n2.

But after several days of speculation, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the chairman of the House tax committee, said Republicans would only pass a new tax cut if they kept control of both congressional chambers.\n\nSince it seemed unlikely Republicans would keep the House, Brady\u2019s condition essentially amounted to an escape from questions about the proposal, which only Trump had talked about but which not even he could explain.\n\nAs for whether the tax cut even existed or was simply a political ploy by a president known to make up stuff, Brady insisted on Wednesday that it was based on some vague semblance of reality.\n\n\u201cIn truth, we\u2019ve been working with the president for some time and had developed some good options for him,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nTrump had said that unlike last year\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2015 which benefited all income groups but especially the wealthy \u2015 the new bill would be just for the middle class. HuffPost asked Brady how that would work, exactly \u2015 would it be a rate reduction? A deduction? A credit?\n\n\u201cJust generally a focus on middle-class families and workers,\u201d Brady said.\n\nWhen Trump first mentioned the tax cut, Brady\u2019s office referred questions to the White House, but administration aides had nothing to say about it. Pressed for details in the Oval Office by reporters, Trump referred questions to Kevin Hassett, his top economic adviser. But Hassett referred questions back to Trump.

A staggering 95 percent of these cases were never covered by national or international media, UIHI revealed Wednesday in its new report.\n\nThe oldest of the victims was 83. The youngest, an infant. Nearly 100 cases were tied to domestic violence, sexual assault or police brutality. The circumstances surrounding many of the other deaths and disappearances remain unknown.\n\nThese data were collected from cities that were known to have Native populations in 29 states. Some two-thirds of the cases that UIHI managed to find were from the last decade, although the oldest case dated back to 1943.\n\nThe 500-plus number likely represents a gross undercount, the Seattle-based tribal epidemiology center noted. The limited available information at various law enforcement agencies, and in some cases, the complete lack of it, speaks volumes about the racist attitudes surrounding indigenous issues in America, UIHI said.\n\n\u201cOur women and our children, our girls, they hold such value within our communities,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, the chief research officer at the Seattle Indian Health Board and the director of UIHI. \u201cFor us to let their deaths to just go unnoticed \u2014 for people not to know that we have missing women in our communities, for their voices not to be heard \u2014 to me was unacceptable.\u201d\n\nUIHI faced significant challenges over the past year while trying to gather information. Almost half of municipal police departments either failed to respond within the set time limit or failed to respond at all, the report said, and 15 percent cited an inability to search for American Indian, Native American or Alaska Native people in their data systems. Searching news reports, social media, missing persons databases and other sources, UIHI added up more than 150 cases, dubbed \u201cthe invisible 153,\u201d that did not even exist in police records.\n\nFor too long, data has been about other people telling Native people who we are. Annita Lucchesi, cartographer and doctoral intern at the Urban Indian Health Institute\n\nAnnita Lucchesi, a cartographer and doctoral intern at UIHI, worked with the center to count the missing and murdered indigenous women in the 71 selected cities. It\u2019s an issue close to Lucchesi\u2019s heart: Ashley Laurie Heavyrunner, one of her former students from Blackfeet Community College in Browning, Montana, has been missing for more than a year. Heavyrunner vanished from Montana\u2019s Blackfeet Reservation on June 7, 2017, at age 20.\n\n\u201cFor too long, data has been about other people telling Native people who we are,\u201d said Lucchesi. \u201cIt\u2019s time we tell the world who we are, and that the world actually listens to us.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 alone, 5,712 cases of missing Native women nationwide \u2015 in cities, towns and rural areas \u2015 were reported to the National Crime Information Center. Just 116 of them were logged in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s missing persons database, according to UIHI\u2019s report. Despite the sobering scope of the crisis, relatively little action has been taken at a political level.\n\nIn 2017, Democrats introduced a bill known as Savanna\u2019s Act that is still pending in the U.S. House of Representatives. Named after 22-year-old Savanna Greywind of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was killed while pregnant in 2017, the bill was designed in part to increase and improve data collection for cases of missing and murdered indigenous women. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who introduced the bill in the Senate, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who co-sponsored it, unveiled UIHI\u2019s report on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWhen I introduced Savanna\u2019s Act, one of the main goals was to raise the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women to a national level and begin the conversation of how to address it. ... With today\u2019s report and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee moving forward on Savanna\u2019s Act, we\u2019re taking important steps toward finally raising the awareness needed to save lives and tackle this horrible epidemic,\u201d Heitkamp said in a statement.\n\nToo often, Echo-Hawk said, Native women and girls go missing \u201cthree times\u201d \u2015 in life, in data and in the media. \u201cTheir deaths are only visible to their families and to their communities who hold that grief, that hardship. And yet nobody sees it but them,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother area where indigenous women and girls have been noticeably absent is in the global Me Too movement. More than 4 in 5 American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetimes, including more than half who have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016 study funded by the National Institute of Justice. More than 1 in 3 had experienced violence in the past year.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women in Indian country touches everybody in the community,\u201d said Bree Black Horse, an attorney with the law firm of Galanda Broadman, who works to protect the civil rights of tribal individuals. \u201cAs Indian people, we all know somebody who has been murdered or who has gone missing or had been the victim of violence.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Parkland Shooting Suspect Tackled Jail Guard And Took His Stun Gun, Sheriff Says", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-shooter-jail-guard_us_5bec59e3e4b057089767c963", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:31", "body_paragraphs": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "DC Neo-Nazi Who Called Pittsburgh Murders A \u2018Dry Run\u2019 Arrested; Has Deep Ties To 'Alt Right'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeffrey-clark-dc-neo-nazi-arrested_us_5beb99ffe4b0caeec2bf24e5", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:31", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Jeffrey Clark, the 30-year-old man federal agents arrested here Friday after he called the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting a \u201cdry run\u201d and his relatives worried he might try to launch a race war, wasn\u2019t shy about being a neo-Nazi.\n\nIn April 2017, when someone asked Clark at a White House rally organized by \u201calt-right\u201d coiner Richard Spencer whether he considered himself a fascist, he said no \u2015 he considered himself a Nazi. Antifa activists photographed him at the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. He has posed for pictures in front of Nazi symbols and holding Nazi memorabilia.\n\nOn Gab, the favored social network of racists and anti-Semites, Clark had the username @PureWhiteEvil and called himself \u201cDC Bowl Gang,\u201d a reference to Dylann Roof, the bowl-cut racist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nHuffPost Jeffrey Clark and his Gab gang made a hero of church killer Dylann Roof.\n\nMany alt-right white supremacists worship Roof, and Clark used an image of the killer and balaclava-clad gunmen as the header for his Gab page. His pinned image was an altered still from the video game \u201cDoom\u201d that depicted Roof executing black people in a church.\n\nHuffPost\n\nThis April, Clark threatened a HuffPost reporter, warning that the reporter would be going \u201cfeet first into a woodchipper.\u201d The reporter told police about the threat in August. They did nothing at the time. In late October, D.C. police did come to Clark\u2019s house in the Bloomingdale neighborhood after the death by suicide of his brother, Edward, but did not arrest him.\n\nClark told family members he had been \u201cfriended\u201d on Gab by Robert Bowers, the man charged with murdering 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27. Clark, court documents said, told family members the victims \u201cdeserved it.\u201d He wrote on Gab that the attack was a \u201cdry run for things to come\u201d and that \u201cthe fucking kikes that got shot by the hero #RobertBowers were all active supporters of pedophilia \u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,\u201d according to court documents. Pedophilia-centric conspiracy theories are popular among members of the far-right; in 2016, a North Carolina man armed with a rifle drove to a Washington, D.C., pizza place he falsely believed was the center of a vast pedophilia ring. No one was injured in the shooting.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until November, after Clark\u2019s own family contacted law enforcement, that the FBI finally found the allegedly illegal weapons that have him facing gun charges. Court documents, as well as photos and videos obtained by HuffPost, suggest Clark\u2019s late brother, Edward Clark, shared a similar ideology. That both men were able to spew neo-Nazi rhetoric, amass an arsenal of weapons, and openly threaten journalists and critics for months without consequence shows just how much freedom far-right extremists have to operate in the U.S. \u2014 and how far their behavior has to escalate before law enforcement takes it seriously.\n\nWhite Supremacy, At Home In DC\n\nClark lived in a rowhouse in Bloomingdale with his father, sister and younger brother Edward William \u201cTeddy\u201d Clark, who killed himself on Washington\u2019s Theodore Roosevelt Island on Oct. 27, the day of the Tree of Life shooting.\n\nNo one answered the door Tuesday night at the Bloomingdale home, which was completely dark except for a television flickering in an upstairs room.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for these boys to step out of line,\u201d one neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of concern for their safety, told HuffPost. That neighbor, who was aware of Clark\u2019s neo-Nazi leanings and monitored his Twitter account, said that the Clarks, until a few years ago, were one of the only white families on the block, which is in a historically black neighborhood near Howard University that has gotten dramatically whiter and richer in recent years.\n\nI was waiting for these boys to step out of line. A neighbor of Jeffrey and Edward Clark\n\nThe neighbor said that last year several similarly dressed white men gathered at the Clark home around the time of an alt-right free speech rally in the city. The neighbor heard the group chanting what sounded like \u201cSieg Heil.\u201d When white supremacy flyers appeared in the neighborhood and a gay pride flag was torn down from the window of the nearby bar Showtime, the neighbor suspected the Clark boys were involved.\n\nLaura Sennett Jeffrey Clark, far left next to his brother Edward.\n\nFinding Their Place In The Far-Right\n\nThe Clark brothers appear to have been trying to find their footing in the far-right political scene over the past several years, showing up at \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d rallies outside the White House or at events with Spencer. One of them tried to join Identity Evropa, a prominent white nationalist organization, but was rejected, according to a source in the organization.\n\nIn May 2017, the Clark brothers teamed up with far-right \u201cPizzagate\u201d propagandist Jack Posobiec, who was then the D.C. bureau chief for the far-right website Rebel Media, to shoot footage for a film Posobiec was working on about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer whose murder near the Clarks\u2019 home in Bloomingdale has spawned numerous far-right conspiracy theories.\n\nLaura Sennett, an anti-fascist researcher who works with One People\u2019s Project, spoke with Jeffrey Clark a few weeks after he and his brother were spotted in Bloomingdale with Posobiec, who by then had been fired from Rebel under mysterious circumstances after plagiarizing Jason Kessler, the white nationalist who organized the Unite the Right rally.\n\n\u201c[Clark] told me that Jack Posobiec hired him and his brother to follow him with a camera to take video of his investigation of Seth Rich,\u201d Sennett told HuffPost. \u201cNot sure if it was a documentary or a news story, but [Posobiec] was doing some kind of reporting for Rebel Media. I asked him if Posobiec was aware of his Nazi beliefs. He told me that Posobiec absolutely was and had told Jeff that he was sympathetic to those beliefs.\u201d\n\nPhoto taken by a source who spotted Jack Posobiec Conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec being followed by the Clark brothers as they videotape him.\n\nPosobiec, now a host for the conservative One America News Network, denies this. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a Jeffrey Clark,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never hired anyone for Rebel Media, certainly not hired this person, and I never made a Seth Rich documentary for Rebel Media.\u201d\n\nBut there was Posobiec last year, traipsing around Bloomingdale with the Clarks:\n\nPHOTO TAKEN BY A SOURCE WHO SPOTTED JACK POSOBIEC\n\nKnocking on doors, a microphone in his hand:\n\nPHOTO TAKEN BY A SOURCE WHO SPOTTED JACK POSOBIEC\n\nJeffrey Clark also found a common cause with violent white supremacists on Gab, where he posted neo-Nazi propaganda and promoted prominent white nationalist voices such as Patrick Little, Brad Griffin, Jared Wyand and \u201cJack Corbin\u201d \u2015 all of whom Tree of Life shooter Robert Bowers also engaged with on the social media platform. He amplified older white nationalists such as Billy Roper and Peter Brimelow, and expressed his support for white nationalist Republican House candidate Paul Nehlen.\n\nClark\u2019s Gab profile picture was a photo of him and his brother wearing masks and holding guns in front of a flag with a skull and crossbones, according to court documents. The skull has a bowl haircut, another reference to Roof. Edward Clark went by \u201cDC_Stormer\u201d on Gab, according to the FBI. A Twitter account with the same user name is currently suspended. Previously, that account, which antifa activists believed to be linked to one or both of the Clark brothers, posted thinly veiled threats aimed at local antifa activists.\n\nSeveral of the internet service providers who worked with Gab abandoned the social media platform after the Pittsburgh shooting brought public attention to how easy it is for leading extremists to connect with individuals on Gab who might carry out white nationalism\u2019s violent ideology.\n\nHuffPost\n\nRegarding death threats, here's a note from right-wing Jeffery Raph Clark, @dc_stormer, who lives in DC area and has come to #antifa events. pic.twitter.com/bTRTQRH2By \u2014 Lacy MacAuley (@lacymacauley) July 4, 2017\n\nHow It All Came Crashing Down\n\nThe Clarks\u2019 history of extremism ended in the death of one brother and the arrest of another over the past two weeks. Edward Clark killed himself with a Beretta pistol on Oct. 27 sometime before 12:45 p.m., according to court documents. Responding officers found eight remaining rounds in the magazine of his pistol, as well as two additional magazines of ammunition with 20 more rounds. Family members told FBI agents they were surprised by Edward\u2019s suicide and did not know why he had so many bullets on him.\n\nCourt documents imply that Jeffrey knew his brother was up to something unusual on the day of his death. Jeffrey woke up around noon that day. When he realized Edward wasn\u2019t home, he called his mother and said he was going to report Edward missing to the police, even though Edward was 23 and hadn\u2019t been gone for long.\n\nJeffrey is the registered owner of a Remington Arms 1911 R1 handgun and a Mossberg Maverick 88 shotgun. His brother was the registered owner of a Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Rifle and a Beretta 92FS handgun, the gun he used to kill himself. Officers later recovered a Colt .38 Jeffrey gave to a family member that was not registered to either Clark brother. D.C. law requires registration of all firearms with local police.\n\nA D.C. homicide detective went to the Clarks\u2019 home after Edward\u2019s death. Jeffrey told him that Edward\u2019s rifle was still at the house, but the detective did not ask Jeffrey about his guns, according to court documents.\n\nTwo family members called the FBI on Nov. 2 to express concerns about Jeffrey Clark, whom they said had become more outspoken about his white nationalist views after his brother\u2019s death. Jeffrey and Edward \u201chad both fantasized about killing \u2018Jews and blacks,\u2019\u201d and admired mass murderers Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski and Charles Manson, according to court documents. Family members told the FBI that Jeffrey was \u201creally riled up\u201d and \u201cagitated,\u201d and they feared he would hurt himself or others. The brothers believed there would be a race revolution, and they wanted to expedite it.\n\nFamily members showed FBI agents four boxes of gun parts they took from Jeffrey, including parts used to modify AR-15 assault rifles. Agents also found four high-capacity AR-15 magazines that can hold up to 30 rounds of ammunition. Possession of such magazines is prohibited under D.C. law.\n\nJeffrey and Edward\u2019s relatives confirmed they both attended the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. They believed there were photos of the brothers online standing next to James Alex Fields, the white supremacist who drove a car into protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others. They showed FBI agents a picture of the brothers holding a flag for the white supremacist group Vanguard America \u2015 the same group on the flyers posted around Bloomingdale.\n\nThe brothers marched into the Charlottesville rally behind that flag, which was carried by William fears, a white supremacist arrested for attempted homicide after a Spencer speech in Gainesville, Fla., last year. Prosecutors ultimately dropped that case against Fears, who was arrested again this April for allegedly hitting and choking his girlfriend.\n\nLuke Osman\n\nFBI agents spoke with one of the Clarks\u2019 relatives again on Nov. 8. The relative told them that Jeffrey smoked and sold marijuana. They also observed propane torches in the house that are \u201cconsistent with those used for smoking methamphetamine,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nJeffrey described himself on Gab as \u201cAka DC Stormer (RIP), \u201cMeth-Smoking, Pipe Bomb making, mailman-murding,#Fed,#DemoKKKrat, Che Guevara of the altright, Glenn beck, Not a NEET \u2013 just bathing in White priviledge, Bowlcut Nationalism is the only way forward. . .\u201d\n\nClark was arrested on Friday and charged with the federal crime of illegally possessing a firearm while using or addicted to a controlled substance, and the D.C. crime of possessing a high-capacity magazine.\n\nDavid Bos, the federal public defender assigned to Clark\u2019s case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead the court documents here:"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Fox News' Tucker Carlson Stuns Himself By Agreeing With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-tucker-carlson-alexandria-ocasio-cortez_us_5bebd78ce4b0caeec2bf7087", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:32", "body_paragraphs": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson admitted Tuesday, in a rare moment of nonpartisanism, that he actually agreed on something with Democratic Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nCarlson said it was \u201chard to argue with\u201d the progressive newcomer\u2019s criticism of e-commerce giant Amazon, which has received $2 billion in tax incentives in exchange for locating its two new headquarters in Long Island City, New York, and Arlington, Virginia.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who won her race for a U.S. House seat in New York\u2019s 14th District at last week\u2019s midterm elections, railed against Amazon\u2019s announcement in a series of tweets:\n\nWe\u2019ve been getting calls and outreach from Queens residents all day about this.\n\n\n\nThe community\u2019s response?

The Kennedy Center Honors will be held on Dec. 2 in the Opera House in Washington.\n\nThis year\u2019s honorees are singer-actress Cher, composer Philip Glass, country music star Reba McEntire and jazz legend Wayne Shorter. \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and his co-collaborators will also be receiving a special award for their \u201cunprecedented work.\u201d\n\nThis is the second year in a row that President Trump and his wife will be a no-show at the gala. In 2017, the Trumps said they wouldn\u2019t attend the event to \u201callow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.\u201d Their statement followed the announcement by several honorees, including TV producer Norman Lear and legendary dancer Carmen de Lavallade, that they were boycotting or considering boycotting at least part of the ceremony because of the political climate.\n\nDe Lavallade blamed \u201cthe socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our current leadership is choosing to engage in\u201d as the reason behind her boycott. Lear skewered the Trump administration for threatening to get rid of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nSeveral of this year\u2019s nominees have been similarly vocal in their condemnation of the president and his policies. Glass has referred to Trump as an idiot; Cher has compared him to \u201cHitler\u201d (and has said she\u2019d be \u201cthrilled\u201d if Trump does not attend the gala); and Miranda excoriated the president\u2019s response to Puerto Rico\u2019s post-Hurricane Maria devastation, telling him \u201cyou\u2019re going to straight to hell.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post noted, the sitting president has attended the Honors every year since 1978 with just a handful of exceptions. Jimmy Carter did not attend in 1979 because of the ongoing Iran hostage crisis. In 1989 and 1994, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, respectively, were not present because of overseas trips. And in 2015, Barack Obama arrived late to the event after delivering a primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office.\n\nIn all those cases, the first ladies served as hosts, the Post reported.\n\nSome Twitter users reacted to the Trumps\u2019 decision to skip this year\u2019s Honors with disappointment and disdain.\n\nNot surprising obviously.

So it\u2019s no surprise that gummy products now account for $1 billion of the $41 billion supplement market in the United States, a more than 25 percent increase from 2015, according to IBISWorld, a research company.\n\nBut are they equally effective?\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that one form of vitamin is superior to another, according to Zhaoping Li, a professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nShe acknowledged that people are often skeptical about the ingredients used in gummy vitamins. \u201cGummy is made of gelatin,\u201d Li said. \u201cThey also often have other things in it \u2014 glucose or glucose syrup. They often have to add food coloring. And citric acid to keep it stable.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, she added, vitamin gummies, pills or tablets often undergo chemical processing, with added \u201cinactive\u201d materials that help to shape the vitamin into its form. \u201cWe could find out the same concerns \u2026 with tablets as what we\u2019re worried about with gummy vitamins,\u201d Li said.\n\nThat being said, there are some points you should consider as you choose vitamins from the shelves of your local drugstore. Below are some things experts want you to keep in mind about gummy supplements and vitamins in general.\n\nBe aware of gummy vitamins\u2019 added sugar\n\nWachara Kireewong / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nGummy vitamins are typically made with added sugar. It\u2019s one of the reasons they\u2019re so tasty, but it\u2019s also one of the reasons some consumers are hesitant to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nWhether added sugar in your gummy vitamins is cause for concern depends on the amount, said Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author of Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You From Label to Table. As a frame of reference, she said a packet of sugar has 4 grams of sugar. In comparison, if a gummy multivitamin had 3 grams of sugar and provided the vitamins your body needed, the generally low sugar content wouldn\u2019t be concerning. It\u2019s best to look at your sugar intake as a whole, Taub-Dix advised. Less than 10 percent of your calories each day should come from added sugars, according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 200 calories, or about 12 teaspoons, for a 2,000-calorie diet,\u201d Taub-Dix said, adding that some people may need more or less than 2,000 calories a day, depending on their health and activity level.\n\nCalories from sugar can add up quickly, too, she noted, especially if you consume yogurt, cereal, coffee drinks, sauces and salad dressings. High-sugar diets can lead to higher blood pressure, weight gain, diabetes and fatty liver disease, all of which have been linked to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo you wouldn\u2019t want to take a combination of gummy vitamins that are equivalent to 16 grams of added sugar, Taub-Dix said, which could add up to 4 teaspoons of sugar coming from your vitamins alone. And pay attention to your pearly whites, as well: Some dentists say the ingredients that make gummy vitamins taste like candy can also contribute to poor mouth health if left unchecked. (But simply brushing can alleviate that.)\n\nAll things considered, Taub-Dix said, gummy vitamins are fine to take. Just be wary of too much added sugar in your diet as a whole \u2014 which includes gummy vitamins if you take them \u2014 and take care of your teeth.\n\nRemember not everyone should be taking vitamins, gummy or not\n\nKathleen Finlay via Getty Images\n\nBoth Li and Taub-Dix said the greatest advantage of gummy vitamins is compliance: People are more inclined to take them because they taste good. But not everyone needs to take vitamins in the first place.\n\n\n\nVitamins are used to treat vitamin deficiencies, which can result from a lack of adequate nutrition, illness, a health condition or pregnancy. It is possible to get the vitamins you need from food, Li noted, and the focus should be on eating a balanced diet. (Li said half of your plate should be filled with vegetables, then a quarter with whole grains and a quarter with protein.)\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the one who only eats hamburgers and fries [and] hates vegetables other than iceberg lettuce, then you may see potential value in adding multivitamins to a diet,\u201d Li said.\n\n\n\nPeople often consume more calories than they need, yet still fall short of the recommended amount of many nutrients. For adults, a low intake of certain nutrients and vitamins \u2014 such as calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and vitamins A, C and E \u2014 can be cause for concern, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. If you\u2019re a parent, you also need to ensure that your children get enough calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium and vitamin E.\n\n\n\nThere are also special groups with more specific vitamin needs, including the elderly, those living with diabetes, those who have alcoholism, patients who have undergone a weight-loss surgery or a resection of the stomach, vegetarians and vegans.\n\n\n\nNot sure if you need vitamins? Consult a doctor or a pediatrician (if the vitamins are for your child), who can help to identify vitamin deficiencies and assess whether a supplement is needed. Keep in mind, Taub-Dix said, that some health care providers may work in partnership with certain supplement brands, so you might find a better price for a comparable product elsewhere.\n\nCheck the label before you purchase\n\nStroll down the vitamin aisle at the store and you\u2019ll notice gummy vitamin labels geared toward specific demographics like women or children. Others appeal to certain health concerns, such as gut health or immune system support. However, products that go by different names can still have overlapping vitamin ingredients, which could potentially be dangerous.\n\nVitamin A, for example, is a fat-soluble vitamin. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed into the body with help from bile acids, which are fluids in the body used to absorb fat. If you consumed a multivitamin, an immune-boosting supplement and food (such as fish oil, milk or eggs, for example) that all have vitamin A in them, Li said, that could be cause for concern, unless you have a vitamin A deficiency. If you take too much vitamin A in total, \u201cit can cause liver failure,\u201d Li added.\n\nComparatively, B vitamins are water-soluble vitamins, which are easily absorbed by your body and aren\u2019t stored in large amounts. \u201cIf you take too much, your kidney just gets rid of it,\u201d Li said.\n\n\n\nConsult a health care provider to avoid exceeding the Recommended Dietary Allowance, based on your individual needs and diet.\n\nKnow that some gummy vitamins aren\u2019t vegetarian- or vegan-friendly\n\nkate_sept2004 via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s also important to check the vitamin label for common allergens, which are called out under the ingredients. Vegan- and vegetarian-friendly options will also typically be called out on the label, but it\u2019s worth double-checking.\n\nGelatin, for example, is used in many gummy vitamin products. It can be produced from animal skin, tendons, ligaments, and/or bones, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. However, there is a product called agar-agar, which is derived from a type of seaweed and may be used as a gelatin substitute for vegans.\n\nKeep in mind the FDA isn\u2019t responsible for checking on the safety of vitamins before they\u2019re sold publicly\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration treats vitamins \u2014 including gummies \u2014 as \u201cdietary supplements.\u201d Therefore, gummy vitamins are subject to the same safety, manufacturing and labeling (and other) requirements as any dietary supplement, FDA press officer Lindsay Haake said in an email.\n\n\n\nHowever, dietary supplements \u2014 including multivitamins \u2014 do not need to be approved by the FDA before they can be sold publicly. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement after it reaches the market. That means it\u2019s up to the companies and individuals who manufacture or market dietary supplements to ensure their products are safe and lawful before selling them.\n\n\u201cFirms can introduce new dietary supplement products to the market without receiving approval from FDA,\u201d Haake said. \u201cIn fact, firms can often lawfully introduce dietary supplements to the market without even notifying FDA.\u201d\n\nThe FDA can inspect dietary supplement facilities to evaluate their compliance with regulations \u2014 and take action where appropriate. That action could include warning letters and recommending judicial action to the Department of Justice, Haake said. If the FDA can prove that a product is unsafe or falsely labeled after it reaches the market, the agency can also have it removed from distribution.\n\nHow can you find a gummy vitamin that is likely to follow safety and quality protocols? Consider buying vitamins from well-known brands, Li said, as they tend to be more consistent in quality and experts know more about them. Consumer Reports has also investigated many major multivitamin brands over the years to ensure their claims are accurate.\n\nBeware of teaching kids that vitamins taste like candy\n\nG&J Fey via Getty Images\n\nThe fact that gummy vitamins often look and taste like candy may increase a child\u2019s willingness to take them. However, that can also lead them to take too many. As most vitamin labels indicate, keep them out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet.\n\n\u201cFor children, because they like the sweet taste, they may take more because they don\u2019t know better,\u201d Li said, adding that parents should supervise their kids while taking gummy vitamins \u2014 and make sure they understand they are not candy.\n\nIf your child exceeds the recommended amount, call the free poison help line at 800-222-1222.

So they decided to take the parks to the kids.\n\nWith money donated in 2012 by corporate sponsors and a portion of their parish budget, the local parks and recreation agency, known as the Baton Rouge Recreation, or BREC, bought a box delivery truck, painted it with bright colors and filled it with scooters, hula-hoops, balls, slack lines, trampolines, sidewalk chalk and jump ropes.\n\n\u201cThe idea came to us one day while we were watching a bunch of kids turn flips on an old mattress someone had discarded near the office,\u201d said Diane Drake, who directs BREC\u2019s playground on wheels. \u201cWe realized it wouldn\u2019t take much to get kids moving if we put it right in front of them.\u201d\n\nNaming the mobile playground BREC on the Geaux (a Cajun play on words for go), the parks and recreation agency in 2013 started what would become a daily program by holding community events at housing complexes, churches, parks and schools in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nCourtesy of the Recreation and Park Commission for the Parish of East Baton Rouge During a weekslong flood in 2016, the Recreation and Park Commission for the Parish of East Baton Rouge took sports equipment to local shelters to give kids a much-needed play break.\n\nIf peals of laughter and swarms of activity are any indicator, BREC on the Geaux was an immediate success, Drake said. \u201cOnce word spread, children would come running out of their apartments as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. It was all we could do to unload the equipment before they grabbed it and ran off.\u201d\n\nA year after it began, BREC officials drove the mobile playground to Charlotte, North Carolina, to share their story with others at a 2014 meeting of the National Recreation and Park Association.\n\nSince then, BREC has received dozens of emails and phone calls from other cities seeking advice on how to start a similar program, Drake said. Recreation officials in Knoxville, Tennessee, told Stateline in an interview that they plan to start a copy of BREC\u2019s program next year.\n\nOther imitators include Waynesville, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; Mt. Pleasant, Michigan; and Alexandria, Louisiana.\n\nTransporting the joy and the health benefits of play to kids in underserved neighborhoods isn\u2019t a new idea. A concept called \u201cPlay Streets,\u201d in which local volunteers work with police and health officials in urban neighborhoods to temporarily block traffic so kids can play, has been thriving for decades in places like London, Chicago, New York and San Francisco.\n\nBut the idea is only now starting to take root in small and medium-sized cities \u2014 and in a handful of rural towns \u2014 where it turns out that low-income children and adults are even more prone to obesity than in the nation\u2019s urban centers, according to a June report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBaton Rouge was not the first city to launch a mobile playground. \u201cWe stole the truck idea from Rochester, New York,\u201d Drake said, having researched other cities after their initial idea. \u201cBut our concept was different because it was designed to combat obesity.\u201d\n\nRochester\u2019s \u201cRecreation on the Move\u201d program offers homework help, read-aloud programs, art and music, in addition to some sports and group games.\n\nThe oldest known mobile playground started in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, more than 70 years ago, and it\u2019s still operating, Drake said. \u201cThey temporarily repurposed vehicles used to transport seniors one summer and the rest is history.\u201d\n\nIn Winter Park, Florida, a decommissioned fire truck was converted to a playground on wheels in 2012. And in 1997, East Point, Georgia, started using an old police SWAT truck to take play equipment to a basketball park for kids whose parents couldn\u2019t afford to send them to summer camp, Drake said.\n\nBudget-Friendly\n\nBREC started its mobile playground project with $110,000, half from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation and half from the parish budget.\n\nThat paid for the truck, play equipment and staff and sustained the project for two years, with funds left over. In the third year, the agency bought a second truck and hired more staff with new funding from Blue Cross and other donors.\n\nA Play Streets project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported play events in four diverse low-income rural communities last summer \u2014 Warrenton, North Carolina; Talihina, Oklahoma; Oakland, Maryland; and Cameron, Texas \u2014 on a much smaller budget: $6,000 for a handful of community events.\n\nInstead of shutting down a street, the communities held the events in parks, fields and other public spaces.\n\nWorking with a local health department, an agricultural extension service, a church and a tribal health center from the various towns, Robert Wood Johnson researchers found that the Play Streets concept could be cost-effectively adapted for rural communities, said Keshia Pollack Porter, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University who worked on the project.\n\nIn addition to providing needed community interaction as rural residents traveled to town centers for the events, bouncy houses and other inflatable play equipment inspired kids and some adults to get moving. Strapping pedometers on kids who volunteered, researchers showed that physical activity among participating children was higher during the three- to five-hour events than it otherwise would have been.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University\u2019s Pennington Biomedical Research Center found that similar events sponsored by BREC resulted in kids getting about 50 percent more physical activity, as measured in FitBit steps, compared with weekdays and weekends without Play Street events.\n\n\u201cPlay Streets are not a magic bullet,\u201d said Jamie Bussel, a pediatric health expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. But combined with food and nutrition initiatives, and institutionalized by communities, including schools, day care centers and recreation departments, they can go a long way to tamping the nation\u2019s obesity epidemic, she said.\n\nPlay Deserts\n\nJust this week, a report from a Department of Health and Human Services committee published in JAMA noted that 80 percent of U.S. adults and adolescents are not active enough, and recommended that children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 should do an hour or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day.\n\nNationwide, the childhood obesity rate was nearly 16 percent in 2016-2017, CDC data shows. And obese children are more likely to continue to be obese as adults, which puts them at a higher risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and other conditions.\n\nIn addition, children with obesity are at a higher risk of developing chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, sleep apnea, and bone and joint problems. They\u2019re also more likely to be bullied and have depression, low self-esteem or social isolation, CDC data shows.\n\nStates vary widely in the rate of obesity among youths ages 10 to 17, according to the most recent National Survey of Children\u2019s Health. Eight of the 10 states with the highest rates are in the South. Nine of the 10 states with the lowest rates are in the Northeast and West.\n\nMississippi has the highest rate at 26 percent and Utah has the lowest rate at 9 percent. The obesity rate in Louisiana is 19 percent.\n\nOne of the causes attributed to increased obesity in poor urban neighborhoods is a lack of affordable fresh food, sometimes called a \u201cfood desert.\u201d But researchers say that many food deserts are also play deserts, where low-income children lack safe, stimulating outdoor play spaces.\n\nIn many low-income neighborhoods, parks are plentiful but tend to be poorly maintained and lack amenities such as up-to-date play equipment. They also might be in areas that are unsafe for children to walk to on their own, said Johns Hopkins\u2019 Porter.\n\nThe Elm Grove community in Baton Rouge is one of them, Drake said. That\u2019s why BREC on the Geaux parks there once a week to set up shop. \u201cYou can see the kids peeking out of their windows and doors as we pull up,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they see our truck, they start running.\u201d\n\nDee Taylor calls herself the grandmother and great-grandmother of Elm Grove, a subsidized apartment complex in Baton Rouge. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much of anything for the kids on the grounds.\n\n\u201cThey stayed in their apartments and watched too much TV or played video games all day in the summer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the only thing they knew to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when I heard about BREC on the Geaux, I made a call and they came.\u201d Taylor put up a notice about the mobile playground\u2019s schedule in the window of her apartment and another one on the door of the building\u2019s management office. She told everyone she knew.\n\n\u201cA child needs that kind of physical activity to grow up in a wholesome way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we can give them, the better their lives will be.\u201d\n\nBREC\u2019s two play trucks visit dozens of housing complexes, elementary schools and parks in Baton Rouge every week. They show up at community gatherings on the weekend. During the Louisiana floods of 2016, BREC\u2019s trucks made the rounds at local shelters, giving children a much-needed daily play break.\n\nBREC on the Geaux had more than 100,000 participants in 2016, adults and children. \u201cWe may have been the hardest-working mobile play unit in the business,\u201d Drake said. But since then, BREC was short on funds and had to curtail its schedule slightly. Based on demand, the program should be expanding, Drake said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "IVFML Season 2, Episode 5: When Secondary Infertility Strikes, There's Not Much Sympathy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivfml-season-2-episode-5-secondary-infertility_us_5beb06b5e4b0783e0a1ce980", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:34", "body_paragraphs": "About 3 million women in the U.S. have one biological child but struggle to conceive or carry to term another pregnancy \u2015 a condition known as secondary infertility.\n\nFor some, infertility is a consequence of age, declining egg or sperm quality or medical conditions that may have set in after the birth of a child.\n\nBut others may have started off infertile and needed infertility treatments to conceive the child they already have.\n\nListen to Episode 5 of IVFML Becoming Family below.\n\nFor this segment of the secondary infertility population, the notion that a successful pregnancy and birth can \u201cfix\u201d primary infertility has a lot of cultural currency. Like many deeply rooted cultural myths, the idea has a kernel of truth in it.\n\nIn this episode of IVFML, we go back to our guests from Season One to ask what life is like now that they had children thanks to infertility treatments and whether they are trying to add to their family.\n\nInfertility is a diverse diagnosis, experts say, and whether couples will be able to conceive spontaneously depends on why they were deemed infertile in the first place.\n\nSome people, like Season One guest John Murray, were able to spontaneously conceive a child after infertility treatments. Other guests, like Silvija Ozols or Nam and Aubrey Tran, may hope for a similar outcome but may be more resigned to plunging back into infertility treatments when it comes time to bring more children into the family. Our final guest for the episode, Candace Wohl, knew from the beginning that she would never conceive that \u201csurprise\u201d baby. Wohl had her uterus removed as part of cancer treatment, and thus cannot carry a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cFor many couples, the diagnosis of infertility is more gray,\u201d said Dr. Beth W. Rackow, a fertility specialist at Columbia University Fertility Center.\n\n\u201cSome of these couples may be subfertile and can still conceive on her own,\u201d she explained. \u201cHowever, pursuing infertility treatment can speed up the time until pregnancy.\u201d\n\nAnd while a minority of patients will conceive spontaneously on their own, the odds are that if you needed help to have your first child, you\u2019re going to need help with your second child, said Dr. Ilana Ressler, a reproductive endocrinologist with Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut.\n\nThat struggle may be different the second time around, Ressler said.\n\n\u201cIt can be isolating, with less social support, as the couple already has a child,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may feel reluctant or guilty reaching out to others for fear of not \u2018being grateful\u2019 for the child they already have.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, said Rackow, couples may feel a new ease or lightness when it comes to infertility treatments to add more children to the family.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is the distraction of a child, or a different sense of possibility since they have conceived before,\u201d she guessed."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "John Mayer Reveals Why He Gave Up Drinking After Drake's Birthday Party", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mayer-drinking-drake-birthday_us_5beaef8be4b0caeec2be6683", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:34", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cSome people still say, \u2018That guy\u2019s a dick,\u2019\u201d Mayer told the magazine. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Well, any of that data you\u2019re working off of is really old.\u2019 I mean, I can tell you for sure that I haven\u2019t been a dick in many years.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful.

(Rubin disputes the claim.)\n\nGetty Editorial Google employees at its European headquarters in Dublin join others around the world in walking out of their offices on Nov. 1 in protest over claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism at the tech giant.\n\nThe company gave three executives similarly cushy treatment, even though it did not have any legal obligation to do so, the Times found.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we have terminated 48 people, including 13 senior managers and above for sexual harassment,\u201d Pichai noted in his email. \u201cNone of these people received an exit package. And to clarify: in that time, we have also not provided any exit packages to executives who departed voluntarily in the course of a sexual harassment investigation.\u201d\n\nEvent organizers published a list of five demands for protesters to coalesce around, including pay equity, greater transparency at several levels in Google and an end to forced arbitration agreements.\n\nWe, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nProtesters at the walkout in New York City hoisted signs calling out sexual misconduct and gender inequity in tech, with at least a couple of pointed references to Rubin\u2019s payout.\n\n\u201cHappy to quit for $90 million,\u201d read one woman\u2019s sign. \u201cNo sexual harassment required!\u201d\n\nThe first of many coordinated #GoogleWalkout protests has begun - this is at the firm\u2019s office in Singapore.

Advocates on the right see an opportunity to begin to cut into the high costs of a 2.2-million-person federal prison population.

Grassley of Iowa, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is expected to quickly introduce the legislation and ramp up his lobbying efforts. Senator Richard J.

It projected such confidence that the pound rose sharply in the hours after she first articulated it.\n\nBut on Wednesday, it appeared that Mrs. May\u2019s message had been a bluff. It has been replaced by the opposite logic, conveyed in the most urgent terms: A compromise with the European Union \u2014 a package of wins and losses \u2014 is better than no deal.\n\nEconomists and business leaders have warned that an abrupt, \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit, without an agreement to take the place of membership, could have disastrous consequences for Britain, including shortages of food and other goods and sudden price increases. Moderate voices have long urged compromise as the only sensible solution.\n\nBut by adopting the language of her party\u2019s euroskeptic right wing for so long, Mrs. May ran the risk of a last-minute explosion.\n\nFor Brexiteers, this deal has less to do with practical consequences than with passion and principle.

But there is also deep fatigue, even annoyance, with the whole issue, which other member nations believe has diverted attention from pressing problems like migration, conflict with Russia, potential trade war with the United States, populist dissension within the bloc, and European elections next spring.\n\nAs the British cabinet meets Wednesday afternoon, ambassadors of the other 27 nations of the European Union will also be briefed on the draft deal. The agreement would have to be ratified by the leaders of the member nations, and by the European Parliament.\n\nThe hope is that the European Union can hold a special Brexit summit meeting before the end of November to win approval for the agreement and the accompanying nonbinding political declaration.

The resolution reportedly means Britain must adhere to European Union rules while no longer having a vote on them, an arrangement that critics have called \u201cvassalage.\u201d\n\nBut from the point of view of the bloc \u2014 a creature of rules, laws and regulations \u2014 anything that undercuts the single market is unacceptable, including competition on tariffs and regulations from a nonmember, as Britain soon may be.\n\nIf the agreement wins approval in Britain, the two sides must still negotiate a long-term deal on their future trading relationship. \u2014 STEVEN ERLANGER\n\nA sleeper issue: Scotland\u2019s status\n\nBeyond breaking Britain away from the rest of the European Union, Brexit also poses a growing risk of breaking up the country.\n\nVoters in Scotland rejected independence in a bitterly contested 2014 referendum, but separatism remains a potent force in Scottish politics. In 2016, Scotland voted by a wide margin, 62 percent to 38 percent, to remain in the European Union, while Britain as a whole voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent.\n\nSo when word leaked that Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit deal would allow Northern Ireland to maintain a close relationship to the European market, at least temporarily, Scottish nationalists saw an opening. If Northern Ireland gets a separate deal, they asked, why shouldn\u2019t Scotland?\n\nIan Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party, tore into the deal in Parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo protect jobs in Scotland, we must stay in the single market and the customs union,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister will not drag Scotland out against its will.

Democrats have captured Republican-held Senate seats in Nevada and Arizona, partially offsetting their losses in the heavily white, conservative states where Republicans unseated Democratic senators.\n\nAnd in California, what looked like a night of incremental Democratic gains has turned into a slow-motion rout for the G.O.P. Republicans are on track to lose between four and seven seats there, chiefly in the suburbs of Southern California, where even Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a 30-year incumbent, went down in defeat.\n\nFurther down the ballot, there were signs of Democratic gains in historically Republican parts of the Southwest: In Arizona, where Republicans have dominated state politics, Democrats also captured the office of education superintendent, and a second important statewide election \u2014 for secretary of state \u2014 was still too close to call a week into the count. In Nevada, where Democrats had not won a governor\u2019s race since 1994, they captured the governorship and the offices of lieutenant governor, attorney general, state treasurer and state controller.\n\nIn Texas, Democrats gained at least a dozen seats in the Statehouse and, despite partisan gerrymandering, picked up two congressional seats. Five Republican congressional candidates there who were strongly favored to win ultimately prevailed with less than 52 percent of the vote.\n\nTexas and Arizona are unlikely to be blue states anytime soon, but after years of tilting at the Southwest with little to show for it, Democrats saw real signs that the region is becoming a battleground.\n\nGrant Woods, a former Republican state attorney general in Arizona who recently registered as a Democrat, said Mr. Trump and the Republican Party had moved too far right for voters in the Southwest.

It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: \u201cYou need to limit fats to avoid extra calories,\u201d it states.\n\nBut experts like Dr. Ludwig, argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.\n\nDr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example. But he argues that the carb and insulin explanation for obesity is too simplistic and has been \u201cexperimentally falsified\u201d in rigorous studies.\n\nDr. Hall published a meta-analysis of feeding studies last year that suggested that energy expenditure was actually slightly greater on low-fat diets. But Dr. Ludwig pointed out that those studies were very short, with none lasting longer than a month and most lasting a week or less. He said the process of adapting to a low-carb diet can take a month or longer.\n\n\u201cA few days, or a couple weeks, is not enough time to make any meaningful conclusion about how diets affect metabolism over the long term,\u201d he added.\n\nTo do the new study, Dr. Ludwig and his colleagues collaborated with Framingham State University, about 20 miles outside of Boston, where they recruited overweight students, staff members and faculty members. Each participant went through two phases of the study. First, they were put on strict diets that lowered their body weight by about 12 percent, which was designed to stress their metabolisms.\n\n\u201cAt that point their bodies are trying to regain the weight,\u201d Dr. Ludwig said. \u201cIt pushes the body and predisposes to weight regain.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Juul Suspends Selling Most E-Cigarette Flavors in Stores", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/health/juul-ecigarettes-vaping-teenagers.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 19:02:43", "body_paragraphs": "In recent months, the F.D.A. has mounted an increasingly aggressive campaign against the major manufacturers of vaping products that appeal to young people, focusing particularly on Juul.
