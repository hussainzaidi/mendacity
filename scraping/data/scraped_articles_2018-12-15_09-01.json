But, he added of the ruling, \"everyone will be confused about what it means.\"\n\nThe judge's ruling is only the latest challenge facing Obamacare this enrollment season, which ends Saturday.\n\nThough Americans have been rushing to sign up before the deadline, the last-minute uptick may not be enough to overcome a noticeable drop in interest. The decline comes as the Trump administration has curtailed advertising and promoted alternative coverage options.\n\nOpen enrollment ends at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday in most of the country, including the 39 states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov. A few states that run their own exchanges, such as New York, California and Minnesota, have deadlines as late as January 31.\n\nSome 4.1 million people have already selected plans for 2019. However, the average number of people signing up per day is down more than 9% from the same period a year ago as of December 8, according to the most recent federal figures.\n\nThe decline is particularly steep among those signing up for coverage for the first time. Their numbers are down nearly 18%, while returning customers have dropped less than 6%.\n\nSign-ups will likely come in 800,000 lower than last year, according to an estimate by Get America Covered, an enrollment advocacy group founded by former Obama administration officials.\n\nInterest picked up this week, which typically happens at the end of open enrollment. Traffic to healthcare.gov on Monday was the highest so far this period, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which runs the federal exchange.\n\nIn Florida, residents are \"bombarding\" the few remaining navigators, who assist with enrollment, said Jodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida, the only organization to receive a federal navigator grant in the Sunshine State this year.\n\nThe navigators are almost fully booked through Saturday. That's in part because they have far fewer resources this year. Ray has seen her budget cut from $5.8 million in 2016 to $1.25 million this year. There are only 59 navigators working in half of Florida's counties, instead of the typical staffing of 150-plus people who cover the entire state. Residents in the remaining counties can only get assistance by phone or online.\n\n\"We're trying very hard not to turn people away,\" said Ray, adding many consumers need some guidance in picking a plan. \"When they can sit and look at different plans and ask questions, it increases their confidence level in making an actual choice.\"\n\nScreengrab of healthcare.gov from December 13, 2018\n\nThe dearth of assistance is among the reasons why experts think sign-ups are lagging, despite the fact that many consumers are seeing lower premiums and more choices of insurers for next year.\n\nAnother factor: The Trump administration has made it easier to buy cheaper alternatives, particularly short-term plans . Also, Americans will no longer be hit with a penalty for not having insurance. Plus, the economy is doing better so more folks may have coverage at their jobs.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem may be a lack of awareness of the deadline, said Andy Slavitt, former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration. The Trump administration cut the enrollment period in half and slashed the advertising budget by 90%. But state-based exchanges have kept up their marketing campaigns and outreach, and their enrollment is up in most places, he said.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and celebrities, including Stephen Colbert, have taken on the marketing mantle, posting about open enrollment on social media.\n\nNo jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I'm going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15.

Retweet this, y'all! https://t.co/s3MBOsgLJM \u2014 Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) December 4, 2018\n\nIn Florida, which uses the federal exchange, many people will likely miss the deadline, Ray said. The federal government used to air television commercials during open enrollment before President Donald Trump took office. And Ray had enough funding for television and radio spots, too. Those are all gone now, she said. Sign-ups are down about 22,500, or 2.2%.\n\nOnly a quarter of those who buy their own insurance or are uninsured know when open enrollment ends, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll\n\n\"The reduced advertising makes a tremendous difference,\" said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of access initiatives at Families USA, a health care advocacy group.\n\nHealth & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Axios on Wednesday that \"we don't know\" why open enrollment is lagging this year but said it's important to wait until after those who are automatically re-enrolled next week are counted.\n\n\"It's going to be very important to close the books on open enrollment and see where that stands,\" Azar said at the Axios event.\n\nCurrent Obamacare enrollees who don't pick a plan for next year will automatically be placed in the same policy on December 16. This means that they will not be able to switch because open enrollment will be over. Last year, 2.9 million people were automatically re-enrolled.\n\nMore people may be tempted to roll over into the same plan because their insurer may have said their plan's premium won't go up much next year. But this could prove costly, especially if they are among the 85% of enrollees who receive federal premium subsidies, said Cynthia Cox, director, health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThese subsidies are based on income and on the cost of the benchmark silver plan in their area. Both of those can change year-to-year so some enrollees may wind up paying more than they expect if they don't actively re-enroll through healthcare.gov."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Federal judge strikes down Affordable Care Act", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/E11oovOsnRg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand.\n\nLegal experts say the ruling won't immediately affect Americans' health coverage, and a group of states led by California is already vowing to appeal. But the invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe ruling and expected appeal sets up another cliffhanger in which the fate of the law, which Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to repeal for years, will likely once again ultimately lie with the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote leaving the law intact in 2012, but it's unclear how the justices will view this challenge, which centers on changes to the individual mandate that were baked into the 2017 tax reform.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a promise to undo Obamacare, was thwarted in Congress last year by a lone vote from the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain.\n\nTrump immediately tweeted in celebration on Friday and called on Congress to act.\n\n\"As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe later added, \"Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!\"\n\nDemocratic House leader Nancy Pelosi decried the ruling and suggested that the coming Democratic-led House will intervene in the case.\n\n\"Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision and for the fear they have struck into millions of families across America who are now in danger of losing their health coverage,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"When House Democrats take the gavel, the House of Representatives will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nToday, the law governs American health care.\n\nMore than 4 million people have already signed up for 2019 coverage on the exchanges, and millions more are expected to pick plans before open enrollment ends Saturday.\n\nThe ruling threatens to wipe away the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions, which became a focal point of the midterm elections and helped Democrats take the House.\n\nIn his opinion, District Judge Reed O'Connor said the \"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause\u2014meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\"\n\nHe also held that the individual mandate is \"essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA.\"\n\nThe case against the ACA was brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors, as well as two individuals. It revolves around Congress effectively eliminating the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0 as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe Republican coalition, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is arguing that the change rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional. The states say that the voiding of the penalty, which takes effect next year, removes the legal underpinning the Supreme Court relied upon when it upheld the law in 2012 under Congress' tax power.\n\nThe Trump administration said in June that it would not defend several important provisions of Obamacare in court. It agreed that zeroing out the penalty renders the individual mandate unconstitutional but argued that invalidates only the law's protections of those with pre-existing conditions. These include banning insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories, as well as limiting coverage of the treatment they need.\n\nBut the administration maintained those parts of the law were severable and the rest of the Affordable Care Act could remain in place.\n\nProfessor Tim Jost, of Washington and Lee University, noted that O'Connor went further than the Trump administration had asked.\n\n\"The Trump administration only asked that the individual mandate and provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions be invalidated, but O'Connor's order would invalidate many provisions of the Medicaid program, the Medicare program and other federal laws,\" he told CNN.\n\nBut Jost said the structure of the challenge and of O'Connor's ruling means that nothing will change right away.\n\n\"Judge O'Connor has declared the individual mandate unconstitutional and the rest of the Affordable Care Act invalid, but he has not blocked its continued operation,\" Jost said.\n\nBecause the administration would not defend the law, California, joined by 16 other Democratic states, stepped in. They argued that the mandate remains constitutional and that the rest of the law, in any event, can stand without it. Also, they said that eliminating Obamacare or the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would harm millions of Americans.\n\nAppeal coming\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the ruling \"an assault\" and a spokesperson for his office indicated an appeal would be coming.\n\n\"Today's ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA's consumer protections for healthcare, on America's faithful progress toward affordable healthcare for all Americans,\" Becerra said in a statement. \"The ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAmerican Medical Association president Barbara McAneny said the group will work with other groups in pursuing an appeal and reversal of the decision.\n\n\"Today's decision is an unfortunate step backward for our health system that is contrary to overwhelming public sentiment to preserve pre-existing condition protections and other policies that have extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans,\" she said in a statement. \"It will destabilize health insurance coverage by rolling back federal policy to 2009. No one wants to go back to the days of 20 percent of the population uninsured and fewer patient protections, but this decision will move us in that direction.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Paxton applauded the ruling and said it represents a massive check on federal power.\n\n\"Today's ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system while our multistate coalition lawsuit works its way through the courts,\" Paxton said in a staement. \"Our lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, a CNN legal analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said he felt an appeal could be looked on favorably by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The ruling relies on conclusions about who can bring this suit and about the impact of President Trump's tax bill that have been widely debunked by scholars from across the political spectrum,\" Vladeck said. \"It will certainly generate headlines, and it may even be upheld by the conservative federal appeals court in Texas, but it's difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court\u2014which has already turned away two challenges to the ACA\u2014would agree with tonight's ruling.\"\n\nPre-existing conditions and the midterm fight\n\nThe lawsuit entered the spotlight during the midterm elections, helping propel many Democratic candidates to victory. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions became a central focus of the races. Some 58% of Americans said they trust Democrats more to continue the law's provisions, compared to 26% who chose Republicans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation election tracking poll released in mid-October.\n\nThe consumer protections targeted by the administration are central to Obamacare and transformed the health insurance landscape. Their popularity is one of the main reasons GOP lawmakers had such difficulty repealing Obamacare last year.\n\n\"Guaranteed issue\" requires insurers to offer coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, insurers often rejected applicants who are or had been ill or offered them only limited coverage with high rates.\n\nUnder the law's community rating provision, insurers are not allowed to set premiums based on a person's health history. And the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage meant that insurers cannot refuse to pay for treatments because of a policyholder's medical background.\n\nAll these provisions meant millions of people with less-than-perfect health records could get comprehensive coverage. But they also have pushed up premiums for those who are young and healthy. This group would have likely been able to get less expensive policies that offered fewer benefits prior to Obamacare. That has put the measures in the crosshairs of Republicans seeking to repeal the law and lower premiums.\n\nIt's no wonder that politicians on both sides of the aisle promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions during the election. Three-quarters of Americans say that it is \"very important\" for the law to continue prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage because of medical histories, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's September tracking poll -- 58% of Republicans feel the same way. And about the same share of Americans say it's \"very important\" that insurers continue to be barred from charging sick people more."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Some Americans ditch Obamacare for cheaper alternatives", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/4sIlZvm_kSo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) When Guy Furay, who owns The Insurance Source in Greer, South Carolina, had a 61-year-old man and his wife come in looking for an alternative to pricey Obamacare insurance coverage, he had a solution: a short-term health plan.\n\nThe couple, who were healthy and earned too much to qualify for federal subsidies, were facing a monthly premium of $2,350 for 2019 for an Obamacare-compliant policy that they rarely used.

Short-term plans typically provide less comprehensive benefits -- maternity and prescription drug services are often not included -- and have financial limits on their coverage.

They got neither, the diplomat said.\n\nAfter May's presentation, said to have been short on specifics, the final text of the summit's conclusions was changed to cut a suggestion that the EU consider what further assurances could be provided to the UK, another EU diplomat said. A reference to contingency preparations for a no-deal exit was left intact.\n\nMay failed to persuade EU leaders to offer her a lifeline after a bruising no-confidence vote this week.\n\nSome EU leaders urged British lawmakers directly to face up to their responsibilities. \"Now MPs in London should be responsible and to know if they want to have the best possible deal, or to go in a direction where they don't know what will come out, \" said Xavier Bettel, the Luxembourg Prime Minister.\n\n\"They should think about the interests of their voters, and of the people in their country, and if they respect that, they should vote for it,\" he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also effectively put the ball in London's court. \"As far as the EU is concerned we'll be doing everything in our power but we'll be expecting the United Kingdom to do everything in their power to make this happen,\" Merkel said in her closing remarks.\n\n\"There are a lot of concerns and fantasies around the backstop,\" Macron said. \"What comes next is in the hands of the British Parliament.\"\n\nSebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, who has been a key ally of the British Prime Minister, attempted to put a positive gloss on the outcome. \"We told Theresa May once again that we will not open or reopen the withdrawal agreement, but besides the withdrawal agreement there is a huge understanding of both sides and a wish to find a way to deal with Brexit,\" he said.\n\nIn London, the opposition Labour Party called for May to reschedule the delayed Brexit vote in Parliament before Christmas.\n\n\"The last 24 hours have shown that Theresa May's Brexit deal is dead in the water,\" said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. \"She's failed to deliver any meaningful changes. Rather than ploughing ahead and recklessly running down the clock, she needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control.\"\n\nBreaking the impasse?\n\nEvents of the past few months have solidified May's reputation as a political survivor. But the decision to call off the Brexit vote in Parliament, followed by a no-confidence vote in which a third of her MPs registered their disapproval of her leadership, have left May seriously weakened.\n\nWith just over 100 days before the March 29 Brexit deadline, there is precious little time to negotiate a new deal should the current one be voted down, even if the EU wanted to.\n\nLabour and other opposition parties have pledged to call for a vote of no confidence in the government, should May's bill be defeated. That could lead to a general election.\n\nFollowing the defeated Conservative leadership challenge this week, the math may be in their favor. May's critics within her own party are stuck with her through the Brexit process -- the failure to win this week's confidence vote means they can't launch another challenge for 12 months.\n\nThe only other option for May would be to call a second Brexit referendum. That would require her to reverse her implacable opposition to such a move -- although it would not be her first big policy U-turn.\n\nAfter Wednesday's vote on her leadership, May told reporters she was ready to \"get on with the job of delivering Brexit.\" Less than 48 hours later, she's looking more stuck than ever.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Austrian chancellor's name and the number of days until the Brexit deadline."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Jewish cemetery outside Strasbourg vandalized", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/zTRWSIVkOvw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Tombstones and a Holocaust memorial in a Jewish cemetery outside Strasbourg, France, were vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti earlier this week.\n\nThe vandalism was discovered Tuesday at the Herrlisheim Jewish cemetery hours before a gunman opened fire in Strasbourg's Christmas market, killing four people and wounding 13.

Sutter (@jdsutter) December 14, 2018\n\nUS President Donald Trump has pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement. That can't technically happen until 2020, though, so the nation still has a presence in these talks.\n\nNot everyone here sees the US playing the spoiler role in Poland.\n\n\"When Trump announced that the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement, we thought it would be reflected strongly in having a US administration blocking negotiations,\" said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, president of a previous round of these negotiations, COP20, and global lead for climate and energy issues at World Wide Fund for Nature, a US-based environmental group.\n\n\"Fortunately, that hasn't happened,\" he said. \"The US negotiators and head of delegation have not been a strong supporter -- but haven't blocked negotiations.\"\n\nThe point of the negotiations is to come up with a \"rulebook\" that will make real the Paris Agreement on climate change, to which countries agreed at these talks in 2015.\n\nNew, but not final, drafts of those rules were released on Thursday night and will continue to be revised. The talks were supposed to end Friday but now appear to be headed into the weekend, according to several observers and negotiators involved in the discussions.\n\nAmong the issues ministers are debating are rules for reporting emissions; financing -- or even reparations of sorts -- for developing countries as they deal with the effects of climate change; and, importantly, the symbolic issue about \"welcoming\" the best international science.\n\nMembers of the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice protest ahead of the final session of the COP24 summit on climate change in Katowice, Poland.\n\nThe Paris Agreement calls for countries to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or at most 2 degrees -- above pre-industrial levels. It's a global \"peer pressure\" agreement that relies on nations submitting their own plans for cutting pollution and reporting on those efforts. There are no financial penalties, for example, if nations fail to meet their pledges.\n\nPartly for those reasons, it's crucial that there are clear and strict rules that require countries to report how much progress they are or aren't making to reduce pollution, said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and director of Climate Analytics, a nonprofit research and policy group.\n\nAspects of the current rules are \"weak,\" he said, but could change.\n\n\"This is still in play as far as I'm concerned,\" he said Friday afternoon.\n\n\"We have some real concerns about certain areas,\" said David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute, an environmental policy group. He identified the draft rules around emissions trading as one weakness. Another potential blocker in the ongoing negotiations \"loss and damage\": aid to poorer countries hurt by global warming.\n\nThere remains a sense of uncertainty in the air in Poland.\n\nUntil a final draft of the rulebook is available, it's hard to know how things will turn out, said Todd Stern, the United States climate envoy under the Obama administration.\n\n\"From what I've seen so far, it's edging its way toward a decent outcome -- I hope,\" Stern said, noting that most meetings are taking place behind closed doors.\n\n\"But we haven't seen a document yet. Big things can happen between documents.\"\n\nOthers are even more optimistic. Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for ecological transition, is \"sure\" that an agreement will be reached in Poland, she said Friday afternoon. \"There's nothing that could explain why there would not be an agreement here,\" she said.\n\nThe main hall of the sterile conference center in Poland where the talks are being held was filled twice on Friday with protesters demanding swifter action from world leaders. A group of Polish children, inspired by a teenager from Sweden, walked out of school this morning. On Twitter, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen, called for a global walkout for climate action.\n\n\"It's about time those with power and the resources come down to see what life is like with the people,\" said Taneti Maamau, president of Kiribati, another island nation in the Pacific Ocean. He was overlooking protests in the conference center on Friday afternoon. Environmentalists were chanting \"keep it in the ground\" as they held signs saying, \"Which side are you on?\" and \"System change not climate change.\"\n\nCountries like Tuvalu, which arguably have the most to lose if these talks derail, were on edge about the results of the rulemaking conference, which follows several alarming reports about the clear state of climate science and the fact that global pollution is still climbing.\n\n\"It's so unfortunate -- despite the warnings from the IPCC special report -- that we are stuck in our own self-interested agendas here in this process,\" Tuvalu's Sopoaga said of the UN report.\n\n\"We should rise beyond this,\" he said. \"We cannot allow this to happen.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Search is on for overboard cruise passenger", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/_ZvQxuq8Y50/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Carnival Victory cruise ship arrived back in Miami on Friday after a 26-year-old male passenger went overboard earlier in the day, the cruise line said.\n\nThe US Coast Guard released the ship from search-and-rescue efforts but is continuing to search.\n\nThe man went overboard about 35 miles south of the Florida Keys, officials said.\n\nCoast Guard spokesman John Lally said the Coast Guard is using a fixed-wing aircraft, an HC-144 Ocean Sentry and a Coast Guard cutter in the search.

She had vomited and stopped breathing while in Border Patrol custody. Jakelin later went into cardiac arrest and suffered brain swelling at a Texas hospital.\n\n\"Without the lifesaving measures undertaken by Border Patrol, this child would have likely died in the desert alone without any medical care whatsoever,\" a Department of Homeland Security official said Friday. \"The entire department is heartbroken by this loss of life.\"\n\nThe department's Inspector General's office is investigating the death and said its findings will be released publicly.

Shortly before its 5 a.m. departure, Jakelin's father told agents his daughter was sick and vomiting, the CBP said.

She had a temperature of 105.7 degrees. Local EMTs also provided care before she was transported at 7:45 a.m. by air ambulance to a Texas trauma center.\n\n\"The reality of that part of the border is there's no faster way to get her to treatment than the one she was on,\" the CBP official said.\n\nAt 11 a.m. on December 7, officials at the Lordsburg station were notified the girl had again been revived after going into cardiac arrest, the CBP said. A CT scan revealed brain swelling. She was breathing by machine and diagnosed with liver failure.\n\nJakelin died at 12:35 a.m. Saturday, the CBP said.

But the invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe ruling and expected appeal sets up another cliffhanger in which the fate of the law, which Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to repeal for years, will likely once again ultimately lie with the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote leaving the law intact in 2012, but it's unclear how the justices will view this challenge, which centers on changes to the individual mandate that were baked into the 2017 tax reform.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a promise to undo Obamacare, was thwarted in Congress last year by a lone vote from the late Arizona Republican Sen.

Great news for America!\"\n\nDemocratic House leader Nancy Pelosi decried the ruling and suggested that the coming Democratic-led House will intervene in the case.\n\n\"Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision and for the fear they have struck into millions of families across America who are now in danger of losing their health coverage,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"When House Democrats take the gavel, the House of Representatives will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nToday, the law governs American health care.\n\nMore than 4 million people have already signed up for 2019 coverage on the exchanges, and millions more are expected to pick plans before open enrollment ends Saturday.\n\nThe ruling threatens to wipe away the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions, which became a focal point of the midterm elections and helped Democrats take the House.\n\nIn his opinion, District Judge Reed O'Connor said the \"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause\u2014meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\"\n\nHe also held that the individual mandate is \"essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA.\"\n\nThe case against the ACA was brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors, as well as two individuals. It revolves around Congress effectively eliminating the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0 as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe Republican coalition, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is arguing that the change rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional. The states say that the voiding of the penalty, which takes effect next year, removes the legal underpinning the Supreme Court relied upon when it upheld the law in 2012 under Congress' tax power.\n\nThe Trump administration said in June that it would not defend several important provisions of Obamacare in court. It agreed that zeroing out the penalty renders the individual mandate unconstitutional but argued that invalidates only the law's protections of those with pre-existing conditions. These include banning insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories, as well as limiting coverage of the treatment they need.\n\nBut the administration maintained those parts of the law were severable and the rest of the Affordable Care Act could remain in place.\n\nProfessor Tim Jost, of Washington and Lee University, noted that O'Connor went further than the Trump administration had asked.\n\n\"The Trump administration only asked that the individual mandate and provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions be invalidated, but O'Connor's order would invalidate many provisions of the Medicaid program, the Medicare program and other federal laws,\" he told CNN.\n\nBut Jost said the structure of the challenge and of O'Connor's ruling means that nothing will change right away.\n\n\"Judge O'Connor has declared the individual mandate unconstitutional and the rest of the Affordable Care Act invalid, but he has not blocked its continued operation,\" Jost said.\n\nBecause the administration would not defend the law, California, joined by 16 other Democratic states, stepped in. They argued that the mandate remains constitutional and that the rest of the law, in any event, can stand without it. Also, they said that eliminating Obamacare or the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would harm millions of Americans.\n\nAppeal coming\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the ruling \"an assault\" and a spokesperson for his office indicated an appeal would be coming.\n\n\"Today's ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA's consumer protections for healthcare, on America's faithful progress toward affordable healthcare for all Americans,\" Becerra said in a statement. \"The ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAmerican Medical Association president Barbara McAneny said the group will work with other groups in pursuing an appeal and reversal of the decision.\n\n\"Today's decision is an unfortunate step backward for our health system that is contrary to overwhelming public sentiment to preserve pre-existing condition protections and other policies that have extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans,\" she said in a statement. \"It will destabilize health insurance coverage by rolling back federal policy to 2009. No one wants to go back to the days of 20 percent of the population uninsured and fewer patient protections, but this decision will move us in that direction.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Paxton applauded the ruling and said it represents a massive check on federal power.\n\n\"Today's ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system while our multistate coalition lawsuit works its way through the courts,\" Paxton said in a staement. \"Our lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, a CNN legal analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said he felt an appeal could be looked on favorably by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The ruling relies on conclusions about who can bring this suit and about the impact of President Trump's tax bill that have been widely debunked by scholars from across the political spectrum,\" Vladeck said. \"It will certainly generate headlines, and it may even be upheld by the conservative federal appeals court in Texas, but it's difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court\u2014which has already turned away two challenges to the ACA\u2014would agree with tonight's ruling.\"\n\nPre-existing conditions and the midterm fight\n\nThe lawsuit entered the spotlight during the midterm elections, helping propel many Democratic candidates to victory. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions became a central focus of the races. Some 58% of Americans said they trust Democrats more to continue the law's provisions, compared to 26% who chose Republicans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation election tracking poll released in mid-October.\n\nThe consumer protections targeted by the administration are central to Obamacare and transformed the health insurance landscape. Their popularity is one of the main reasons GOP lawmakers had such difficulty repealing Obamacare last year.\n\n\"Guaranteed issue\" requires insurers to offer coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, insurers often rejected applicants who are or had been ill or offered them only limited coverage with high rates.\n\nUnder the law's community rating provision, insurers are not allowed to set premiums based on a person's health history. And the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage meant that insurers cannot refuse to pay for treatments because of a policyholder's medical background.\n\nAll these provisions meant millions of people with less-than-perfect health records could get comprehensive coverage. But they also have pushed up premiums for those who are young and healthy. This group would have likely been able to get less expensive policies that offered fewer benefits prior to Obamacare. That has put the measures in the crosshairs of Republicans seeking to repeal the law and lower premiums.\n\nIt's no wonder that politicians on both sides of the aisle promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions during the election. Three-quarters of Americans say that it is \"very important\" for the law to continue prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage because of medical histories, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's September tracking poll -- 58% of Republicans feel the same way. And about the same share of Americans say it's \"very important\" that insurers continue to be barred from charging sick people more."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "READ: Federal judge's ruling striking down the Affordable Care Act", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/rr7AdguagbI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law must also fall.

OMB Deputy Director Russ Vought will handle day-to-day operations for the office, Sanders said in a statement.\n\nA senior administration official said there is \"no time limit\" for Mulvaney to remain in the top White House post.\n\nMulvaney could lose the \"acting\" part of his title if things go well, according to another senior administration official.\n\nThe chief of staff job is \"his to lose,\" this administration official told CNN.\n\nThe President's decision to appoint Mulvaney as his chief of staff began to materialize around 4 p.m. Friday afternoon, this official said.\n\nTrump had been marinating on this idea throughout the day and ultimately decided to pull the trigger because the speculation and bowing out of candidates had begun to get out of hand.\n\nThe decision, the official said, was driven by a desire inside the West Wing to put an end to the immense speculation of the last week and to give what had become a chaotic process \"a certain degree of finality.\"\n\nA source familiar with the situation told CNN's Jim Acosta that the President wants Mulvaney to remain OMB director while serving as acting chief of staff. A White House official had earlier told CNN that Mulvaney was going step down from his OMB role and Vought would take over in an acting capacity.\n\nMulvaney, a conservative former South Carolina congressman, will be the third chief of staff in under two years to take on the task of running a White House besieged by a drumbeat of investigations and the expectation of more as Democrats take over the House of Representatives next month. Mulvaney's elevation to the role of chief of staff comes a week after Trump announced that his current chief of staff, John Kelly, will leave his post at the end of the year.\n\n\"I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump tweeted of Mulvaney. \"John will be staying until the end of the year. He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service!\"\n\nTrump appointed Mulvaney to the position in an acting role about a week after Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers declined Trump's offer to become chief of staff, refusing to agree to a two-year time commitment the President had requested. Their inability to come to terms sent Trump scrambling this week to reassess his list of contenders for chief of staff, leading to a search during which one candidate after the next withdrew from consideration or agreed with the President to take themselves out of the running.\n\nWhile Mulvaney remained in the running this week, he had also indicated that he was not interested in the chief of staff role, with a source close to him instead indicating Mulvaney was interested in moving up to lead the Treasury or Commerce departments.\n\nFull plate\n\nMulvaney will take over the job as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is once again taking center stage, with developments in recent days ratcheting up the legal jeopardy Trump could face. On Thursday, Trump's former longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, in part over a felony campaign finance violation he said he committed at Trump's direction.\n\nA senior administration official said Mulvaney and Trump met earlier Friday afternoon and credited the close relationship Mulvaney has built with the President as a reason for his selection, as well as his experience in Congress.\n\n\"He got picked because the President liked him, they get along,\" the senior administration official said. \"He knows Congress. He knows Capitol Hill.\"\n\nTrump named Mulvaney in an acting capacity despite rejecting that very arrangement with Ayers a week ago. Ayers wanted to be named acting chief of staff and only take the job on a temporary basis, with a set departure date of this spring.\n\nBut, even after a statement was drawn up declaring Ayers as the next chief of staff, Trump changed his mind, deciding he wanted a permanent replacement for Kelly before unsuccessfully lobbying Ayers to take on the position for two years.\n\nRight place, right time?\n\nFriday's development surprised several White House officials when Trump abruptly made the announcement. But the choice may have all come down to timing.\n\nThe emerging narrative was that no one wanted the job. Ayers had declined it, several Cabinet members made it known they didn't want it and even the president of the Yankees issued a statement saying he wasn't interested.\n\nCue Mulvaney, who was in the West Wing on Friday to discuss the budget and a potential partial government shutdown next week. Kelly had chaired a senior staff meeting earlier in the morning that was primarily focused on the shutdown threat, one official noted, so a possible shutdown was a big topic of discussion in the West Wing.\n\nMulvaney then met with the President to discuss what to do about a shutdown, and walked out with the acting chief of staff job.\n\nA source familiar with the chief of staff decision told CNN's Acosta that Mulvaney and Trump have been discussing the job over the past couple of days. Tired of the headlines about the chief search, Trump told Mulvaney he had a job to fill and and the OMB director said he preferred to do it on a temporary basis.\n\nHaving said that, this source stresses Mulvaney is \"champing at the bit\" to do the job as he views himself as a \"turnaround specialist.\"\n\nMulvaney, the source added, became interested in the chief job over the summer as news stories focused on Trump's strained relations with Kelly.\n\nHe is not at all worried about dealing directly with Trump and all that comes with the job of chief, the source said, emphasizing he is \"eager and happy to do it.\"\n\nMulvaney, the source said, \"is one of the adults in the room.\"\n\nMulvaney took to Twitter to celebrate the news, calling it \"a tremendous honor.\"\n\nHe previously represented South Carolina's 5th District in the House of Representatives, where he rose to prominence as a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hardline conservatives.\n\nAfter joining the Trump administration as OMB director, he also soon took on the added job of acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in November 2017, a role he served in until just earlier this month.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Hatch says he regrets his 'I don't care' comment about Trump allegations", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/j7Pg8EfFr2k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Sen.

Flynn spoke on the phone with McCabe, McCabe's memo said.\n\n\"Flynn then explained that he had been trying to 'build relationships' with the Russians, and that he had calls in which he 'exchanged condolences,'\" McCabe wrote. \"He then stated that I probably knew what was said,\" the memo continues, before a half line of text in the memo is redacted.\n\n\"I reiterated that in light of everything that has been said about these contacts, the important thing now was for us to hear directly from him what he said and how he felt about the conversations.\"\n\nIt's widely believed that at that time, the FBI was aware of the conversations Flynn had with Kislyak because the intelligence community had listened in on the foreign diplomat's calls. On the calls, Flynn discussed Russian sanctions and a UN Security Council vote with Kislyak.\n\nMcCabe recounts in his memo that he suggested Flynn could involve the White House counsel's office in their meeting, but that would also cause him to bring the Justice Department into the loop. \"He stated that this would not be necessary and agreed to meet with the agents without any additional participants,\" McCabe wrote.\n\nFlynn did not call a personal attorney to participate, either.\n\nThat same day, Comey informed the then-head of the Justice Department, Sally Yates, that the Flynn interview was happening. \"She was not happy,\" another FBI memo said. Shortly after the interview took place, the Justice Department briefed White House officials about the reality of the Flynn-Kislyak calls.\n\nInterview at the White House\n\nMcCabe and Comey sent two agents to visit Flynn that day in the White House, just before 2:30 p.m., McCabe notes. One of those agents, the now-former agent Peter Strzok, filled in details of how the meeting went in a second FBI memo released Friday. (The Mueller team notes that Strzok's recollections come from an interview he did in July 2017 \"in relation to other matters, not as part of the investigation\" of Flynn or into Strzok.)\n\nOnce Strzok and another FBI agent got to the White House, they walked with Flynn past the President, who earlier that day had tweeted about hanging in the White House a photograph of a packed Capitol building steps and National Mall during the inauguration.\n\nA photo delivered yesterday that will be displayed in the upper/lower press hall.

Strzok, now a frequent foil to the President, wasn't introduced to the President at this time, the memo notes.\n\nOnce they sat down to talk, Strzok said he and the other agent \"had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.\"\n\nFlynn was described as not giving \"any indicators of deception. He did not parse his words or hesitate in any of his answers. He only hedged once,\" Strzok is described as saying.\n\nOverall, Strzok thought Flynn was \"bright, but not profoundly sophisticated.\"\n\nFlynn was relaxed, and even in a good mood.\n\n\"Flynn was so talkative, and had so much time for them, that Strzok wondered if the National Security Adviser did not have more important things to do than have such a relaxed, non-pertinent discussion with them,\" the memo recounting Strzok's recollections said.\n\nIn the FBI memo, it does not say what Flynn said about the Kislyak calls or how the FBI agents reacted to him in the moment, however the memo has several redactions.\n\nFlynn later admitted in his federal court proceedings that he had lied during the interview.

One man accuses her of being a drug addict.\n\nManal is an actor in a social experiment organized by the Lebanese women's rights group ABAAD last month. During the nine or so hours when Manal emulated a rape victim, not a single bystander called the police.\n\nThe aim of the experiment -- part of a weeks-long campaign called #ShameOnWho -- was to expose the stigma attached to rape victims, activists say.\n\n\"In general, people think that she's the loose one, she's the one to blame and she's the one who should be held accountable,\" says ABAAD's founder Ghida Anani.\n\n\"We're trying to encourage women who are survivors of rape to speak up, to get out from the cycle and culture of victim-blaming,\" says Anani.\n\nA women's rights protester holds a #ShameOnWho campaign banner at Beirut's yearly marathon this November.\n\nDespite concerted movements by Lebanese civil society to tackle gender-based violence, the problem is growing. In 1994, 30% of women in Lebanon said they experienced some form of violence, according to United Nations figures. Today that figure is closer to 60%, according to data compiled by ABAAD from various ministries, the police and media reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if the increase in claims is due to a greater willingness to report the violence or an actual rise in the number of attacks or a mix of both, Anani says.\n\nBut activists have pushed hard against the trend. Awareness campaigns promoting gender equity are prominent and hard-hitting, and activists have kept up sustained pressure on government to introduce legislation to protect women.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon's parliament passed its first-ever law criminalizing domestic violence. In 2017, it repealed a legal loophole that acquitted rapists who marry their victims. Still, Lebanon's penal code has some way to go. No minimum legal age for marriage exists in the country and marital rape remains legal.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nIn five Beirut locations, artists volunteering with ABAAD have painted black and white murals of rapists' faces, sketched out from the memories of the survivors.\n\n\"These are wanted men,\" says Anani. \"Today, the spotlight should be on the people who are doing this kind of behavior and not those who are subject to it.\"\n\nNot yet willing to step out of the shadows, survivors are speaking out through artists and activists.\n\nOne woman, identified as Reham, recorded her story on an audio file.

Activists criticized what they said was an overly sympathetic portrayal of the man who bludgeoned Assi to death. In his tearful interview, Nheily said he \"regretted\" the 2014 murder and longed to \"turn back time so that neither (he) nor Manal had done wrong.\"\n\nThe episode also featured an actress depicting Manal from beyond the grave, urging non-profit organizations and lawyers to \"stop speaking on her behalf\" and suggesting that the murder could have been avoided if only she and Mohammed had \"talked about (their) feelings.\"\n\n\"It is clear beyond doubt that the aim of this episode -- however much you deny it -- was to justify the murder by having the interview focus on the anger that possessed Mohammed Al-Nheily,\" wrote women's rights group KAFA in a Facebook post addressing MTV.\n\n\"The case was summed up as a crime in which both parties bore equal responsibility,\" it added.\n\nMTV said it gave Nheily \"the same treatment\" as previous prisoners it interviewed in Out of Freedom.\n\n\"The program gave an opportunity to the killer of Manal al-Assi to speak in the same way that it gave an opportunity to 90 prisoners before him. They all provided the reasons and circumstances that led them to commit the different crimes, including domestic crimes,\" said the program's presenter Samir Youssef in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The case of Manal Assi coincided with the efforts of non-profit organizations to develop women's rights laws. So, it was natural that this episode would have caused reactions, especially since the murderer Mohamad al-Nheily was speaking to the media for the first time since he committed the crime.\"\n\nShamed into silence\n\n\"I called it a rape of my rights,\" says one woman, who requests anonymity to avoid personal repercussions.\n\nShe says an ex-lover once secretly videotaped a sexual encounter between them and blackmailed her with it.\n\nShe says he threatened to send the sex tape to her colleagues and family.\n\n\"He said ...

Since the 1930s , scientists have usled fetal tissue in the US, obtained through elective abortions in medical research and experimental therapies. And this research has been supported by the federal government since the 1950s.\n\nDuring the hearing, debate focused on the merits and value of two different types of humanized mice -- one requires fetal tissue, the other does not. Humanized mice, which possess human cells, DNA tissues or immune systems, are used in some biomedical research.\n\nAccording to the scientist whose humanized mouse research was debated between the two sides, some truth can be found on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhat's the issue with human fetal tissue?\n\nIn September, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled a contract with a fetal tissue procurement company due to concerns that the company was not meeting regulations. Subsequently, HHS initiated an audit of human fetal tissue acquisitions and a review to understand whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\n\nHowever, those opposed to abortion have sought, for decades, to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue, while those in the research world support its use.\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report. The National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows.\n\nNot only has the federal government funded fetal tissue research for more than seven decades with procurement governed by an \"extensive regulatory framework,\" but fetal tissue research has a \"long history of support from both sides of the aisle,\" said Judy Chu, the Democratic representative from California who sits on the Steering and Policy Committee, during the hearing. Only today do pro-life \"extremists\" threaten the use of fetal tissue in research.\n\nOf the three scientists who presented testimony to the committee, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, a molecular and cell biologist and an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice, an advisory board member for the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center argued that several ethical alternatives to human fetal tissue are currently available to researchers -- including donated human tissues, bone marrow as well as stem cells and their derivatives.\n\nDr. Sally Temple, a board member and former president with the International Society for Stem Cell Research , which promotes dissemination of ideas and information related to stem cells, said \"the alternatives mentioned may be useful at times but cannot fully replace fetal tissue.\" She noted that fetal tissue, being at a different developmental stage, has \"unique properties\" that donated neonatal tissue lacks and therefore \"the consensus of our field\" is that fetal tissue is \"essential\" for biomedical research.\n\nDiscussion landed on humanized mice when Temple argued that the humanized mouse model created using human fetal tissue, has made advances in HIV research possible. Lee and Prentice said a new humanized mouse model created using non-fetal human tissue sources might serve as an adequate substitute.\n\nNot so fast, said Matt Brown, an assistant scientist in the department of surgery at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the creators of the new humanized mice created without fetal tissue. \"I'm caught in the middle of this,\" Brown told CNN after the hearing, which he did not participate in or attend.\n\nThough he's excited to develop an alternative humanized mouse model, he said more rigorous scientific testing is needed to understand the types of research it can be used for and its value. So it's too early to suggest his alternative model could replace the fetal tissue model, he said, though he speculates his humanized mouse could be better, in some cases, than the current standard.\n\n\"It's a very nuanced discussion,\" said Brown. \"If they go ahead and ban this -- you know black and white, let's ban it all -- there will be so many unintended side effects,\" said Brown. \"They could do so much damage if they ban this the wrong way; it could set science back years and hurt patients, too.\"\n\nAt the same time, he believes scientists \"should listen to people's concerns -- people feel very strongly about [human fetal tissue]. And no scientist wants to use this unless they have to [based on the science],\" he said. \"Scientists should pursue alternatives when they are available.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe hearing drew stark lines in the sand between the two sides, yet middle ground does exist, as suggested by a close listen to arguments. For example, Temple admitted some research that previously relied on fetal tissue is now done in alternative ways, while Prentice noted that the funding of historic cell lines originally derived from aborted fetuses is not in question. And, seemingly thinking aloud, Mark Meadows, the Republican representative from North Carolina who chaired the hearing, suggested the possibility of continued federal funding to support ongoing fetal tissue research, with new projects funded only if they used alternatives.\n\nIn a statement to the committees, Brown expressed modest hopes. He simply wished for a \"constructive dialogue\" regarding scientists' need to access tissue, including fetal tissue, to advance the \"cutting edge research we are undertaking with the goal of alleviating patient suffering worldwide.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Chain restaurants are less healthy than fast food, global study finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/V6mZto7rmAY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Fast food often gets the blame for calorific meals, but new research has found that your favorite chain restaurants are dishing up meals with even more excessive calories, worsening the global obesity epidemic.\n\nOverly large portions and food laden with sugar and fats are regularly being served in sit-down eateries, as well as fast food outlets, according to two studies published in the BMJ on Wednesday.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the problem -- which experts say is fueling obesity, pushing up rates of diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses -- is also not confined to the United States, the studies say.\n\nAlthough the poor nutritional content of fast food has been well-documented, there has been less research into the energy content of more traditional \"full-service\" or sit-down restaurants.\n\nOne UK study analyzed the calories in 13,500 main meals served in 27 UK restaurant chains, of which 21 were full-service restaurants and the remainder serving fast food. A US study measured calories in the most frequently ordered meals in 116 restaurants across five countries -- Brazil, China, Finland, Ghana and India -- comparing them against the United States.\n\nThe calorie content of the most popular meals in British and international restaurant chains is excessive, and only a minority meet public health recommendations, the researchers found. In the global study, only China was found to serve \"significantly less energy than restaurants in the US.\"\n\nFast food, it concluded, contained on average 33% fewer calories than more formal restaurant meals.\n\nThe UK's health agency, Public Health England, recommended that lunches and evening meals should not exceed 600 calories (also measured as kcal). But almost none of the restaurants surveyed reflected this.\n\n\"We found that the number of calories in the average restaurant meal was more than the number of calories in the average fast food meal,\" said Eric Robinson, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, who led the UK study. \"A lot of people would expect there to be more calories in fast food, but our findings were counter to that.\"\n\n'Fast food comes out as the good guy'\n\nThe average main meal dish at a fast food chain in the UK contained 751 calories, compared with an average of 1,033 at sit-down restaurants. Only 11% of full-service dishes served at the 21 restaurants studied -- including Pizza Express, Zizzi and Wagamama -- met the recommended limit of 600 calories, though that rose to 17% in fast food meals.\n\nThese restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe worst-performing of the British fast food outlets, KFC, had an average of 987 calories per meal, but it fared better than more than half of the sit-down restaurants. Meanwhile, an average meal at Burger King (711 calories) proved less calorific than every one of the traditional restaurants surveyed.\n\nThe worst offenders were named as Hungry Horse, where the average meal contained 1,358 calories, followed by Sizzling Pubs (1,269 calories) and Flaming Grill Pubs (1,232 calories).\n\nSizzling Pubs' parent company, Mitchells and Butlers, said in a statement, \"We share nutritional information online for guests to access and we are very mindful of our role in helping guests make knowledgeable decisions about what they eat and drink while dining with us.\n\n\"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes and have also committed to the Public Health England Sugar Reduction programme.\"\n\nThe other restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe international study, which didn't name specific restaurants, found an average of 809 calories in main meal dishes served by fast food chains and 1,317 calories in restaurant chains. Only the Chinese served fewer calories than Americans: 1,045 calories in full-service, compared with 1,362 in US eateries, and 561 in fast food restaurants, as opposed to 969 in America. Indian meals tended to be higher in calories; restaurants in the remaining countries were comparable to those in the United States.\n\nOnce again, a small minority of meals met the 600-calorie recommendation, with 94% of full-service dishes and 72% of fast food dishes exceeding this limit.\n\nRobinson said that although there is considerable debate in Britain about forcing restaurants to display calorie content, only 9% of the meals his research covered met the maximum.\n\n\"So even if you want to know about calories on the menu, you are not left with many meals to choose from,\" he said. \"Restaurants need to serve fewer calories. There are a lot of meals that have far too many calories, whether it's due to portion sizes, ingredients or cooking methods.\n\n\"The bigger issue it relates to is that we are living in a food environment that encourages and causes people to eat more calories than they need,\" he said. \"If a government is serious about trying to reduce obesity and the number of people who die young because of poor diet and obesity, then the food environment is something that needs to be addressed and tackled.\"\n\nSusan Roberts, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, was the lead author of the international study. \"Until now, fast food has been criticized all the time, but in this study, fast food comes out as the good guy,\" she said. \"It was still bad, but it had 33% less calories than standard restaurants.\"\n\nPotential steps to be taken include reducing portion sizes or even introducing proportional prices for restaurant meals, Roberts said. In other words, people would be required to pay for the portions they ordered rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"I think that most of us would be delighted to be able to go into a restaurant and order the size that we actually want. But that would mean that restaurants would have to actually recognize that they are part of the problem, which I think they will deny,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe authors of both reports said no firm conclusions could be drawn, as both were observational. However, they also warned that their findings may not fully reflect the reality, as they did not take in to account drinks, appetizers, desserts or side orders.\n\n'Step up and take responsibility'\n\nCaroline Cerny, lead of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 British organizations and charities, noted that \"regularly eating excess calories over time leads to weight gain.\"\n\n\"Children these days are growing up in an obesogenic environment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to make healthy choices. That's why we welcome government proposals to introduce mandatory calorie labeling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaway. But we also need the whole food industry, including restaurants, to step up and take responsibility for making healthier eating easier, by reducing calories and sugar in their meals by 20% in line with government targets.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTam Fry, chairman of the UK's National Obesity Forum, welcomed the findings but said he thought Public Health England's 600-calorie recommendation was \"unrealistic\".\n\n\"We have all become so accustomed to eating so much more now that I think a more realistic maximum would be about 800 calories,\" he said. \"The restaurant industry has got to clean up its act, but I fear it won't do it voluntarily because they feel they will lose custom. So there must be some kind of regulation to bring them into line, or else they will be named and shamed.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Amber Rudd urges MPs to 'forge a consensus'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46575210", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nMPs across the political divide should \"abandon outrage\" and attempt to \"forge a consensus\" over Brexit, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said.\n\nIn the Daily Mail, Ms Rudd wrote: \"Brexit is in danger of getting stuck.\"\n\nIt comes after the PM's bid to make her Brexit deal more acceptable to MPs suffered a blow when EU leaders said it was \"not open for renegotiation\".\n\nMeanwhile, ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage has told the BBC that he thinks there might be another referendum.\n\nAnd Labour has said the withdrawal deal is now \"dead in the water\".\n\nLast week, Mrs May delayed a vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal, fearing a heavy defeat.\n\nShe then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs - but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her.\n\nShe travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders, to try to make her deal more appealing.\n\nHowever, the EU said there could be clarification but not renegotiation.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it'\n\nMany of Mrs May's own MPs are concerned that the controversial \"backstop\" plan - which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and limit its ability to strike trade deals.\n\nBut Ms Rudd - who supported Remain in the referendum - said she supported Mrs May's deal and advocated assembling a \"coalition\" to avoid what she called \"the rocks of no deal\".\n\nShe said the country \"will face serious trouble\" if MPs \"dig in against the prime minister's deal\".\n\n\"We need to find a plan that a majority in Parliament can support,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to try something different.

If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\n\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\n\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.\n\nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.\n\nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\n\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\n\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\n\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.\n\n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\n\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\n\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.\n\nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\n\nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\n\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\n\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\n\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\n\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\n\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\n\nHow did we make the calculator?\n\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\n\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n\nWhat about serving sizes?\n\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\n\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\n\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\n\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits.

Similar schemes in the past were often shown to be fraudulent.\n\nBut many observers believed that overall, some progress is being made.\n\n\"It was never going to be great, not least because the US is playing a laggard role, but I think we can get a decent outcome, if it's framed in the right way,\" said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nEarlier, the former president of the Maldives, and now their lead negotiator, Mohamed Nasheed, made an impassioned plea for urgent progress on cutting carbon.\n\nImage copyright Matt Winkelmeyer Image caption Mohamed Nasheed is an influential figure in the UN climate process\n\n\"It's just madness for us to allow global CO2 levels (in the atmosphere) to go beyond 450 parts per million, and temperatures to shoot past 1.5 degrees,\" he told a press briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"That can still be prevented. If we come together on the basis of the emergency facing us, we can do it.\n\n\"Every country at this summit will have hell to pay if we don't.\"\n\nWhat are the delegates trying to decide?\n\nRepresentatives from 196 states are here trying to sort out some very tricky questions pertaining to the rulebook of the Paris agreement which comes into force in 2020.\n\nThese are the regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing.\n\nIt sounds easy but it is very technical. At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions.\n\nHowever some progress is being seen in shaping the rules.\n\n\"Some of the text that is key to the rulebook, in terms of the transparency of countries reporting their mitigating actions are pretty strong. It is better than it was a week ago,\" said one senior negotiator.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nBut there are significant holdups.\n\nPoorer countries want some \"flexibility\" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice.\n\n\"The rulebook right now hangs in the balance, because you need all countries on board and you need to support developing countries,\" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace.\n\n\"Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules, and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it, when you don't have a clear signal from developed countries that they are going to provide that support it just brings a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\nAs well as the rulebook, what else needs to be decided?\n\nThere's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this year produced a critical report on how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century.\n\nThe decision to welcome this report was rejected amid controversy earlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report.\n\nWhen consensus couldn't be found, the text about the IPCC was dropped - much to the surprise of a majority of countries. There is a determination here to ensure that at the end of this meeting a \"COP decision\" will recognise the IPCC.\n\n\"There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,\" said Mohamed Nasheed.\n\n\"We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage.\"\n\nWhat about cutting carbon faster?\n\nThere is a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency.\n\nIn the light of the IPPC report many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive.\n\nRight now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as \"grossly insufficient\" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country.\n\nIt is not just the negotiators and ministers here who want to see progress on cutting carbon. Business is looking for a signal from this meeting about the future.\n\n\"Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,\" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola.\n\n\"So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster.\"\n\nWho's really in charge of these negotiations?\n\nPoland holds the COP presidency but there is a lot of concern among delegates that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting.\n\nMost people want to see a strong rulebook, a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive.\n\nWhile some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich and not the poor.\n\n\"I think the presidency is too honed in with the what the high-emitting countries are looking for right now and that could lead to a weak outcome here,\" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace.\n\n\"Often in these talks when it's quite complex, and you don't have clear leadership, that's when countries like Saudi Arabia can come in and just wreak havoc. That's why we need the ministers from EU to come and work with poor nations to drive that home to counterbalance what the Saudis and the Poles are doing here.\"\n\nWhen will it all end?\n\nFor the more than 20,000 people attending these talks, the end can't come quick enough.\n\nMost have been here for around two weeks. The expectation is that it will be Saturday afternoon at the earliest.\n\nSome are worried that it could go into Sunday, but most delegates have flights to catch on that date so the pressure will be on to finish by then.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "What chance has Nasa of finding life on Mars?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46563144", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Drive with Nasa's next Mars rover through Jezero Crater\n\nIt could be easier to detect the signs of ancient life on Mars than it is on Earth, say scientists connected with Nasa's next rover mission.\n\nThe six-wheeled robot is due to touch down on the Red Planet in 2021 with the specific aim of trying to identify evidence of past biology.\n\nIt will be searching for clues in rocks that are perhaps 3.9 billion years old.\n\nConfirming life on Earth at that age is tough enough, but Mars may have better preservation, say the researchers.\n\nIt comes down to the dynamic processes on our home world that constantly churn and recycle rocks - processes that can erase life's traces but which shut down on the Red Planet early in its history.\n\n\"We don't believe, for example, that Mars had plate tectonics in the way Earth has had for most of its history,\" said Ken Williford from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California.\n\n\"Most of Earth's rock record has been destroyed by subduction under the ocean crust.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Rebuilding Detroit: A Woman Who Saves Homes", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/rebuilding-detroit-a-woman-who-saves-homes/4701873.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Nicole Curtis is all about before and after.

An earlier report by the Associated Press misspelled the girl's first name.\n\nJakelin crossed into the U.S. with her 29-year-old father, Nery Caal, after traveling from Raxruha in Alta Verapaz, northern Guatemala.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents detained the pair late on Dec. 6, as part of a group of 163 border-crossers held in a remote area of southern New Mexico, near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry, according to CBP and DHS accounts. A quick evaluation of the girl did not raise any concerns about her well-being, according to the agencies.\n\nBut by the next morning, Jakelin was in distress. She died shortly after midnight on Dec. 8. The initial indication from Providence Children's Hospital in El Paso, Texas, where she was taken, is that she died from septic shock. Her father was with her, CBP said.\n\n\"After completing a dayslong, dangerous journey through remote and barren terrain, the child, who, according to the father, had not been able to consume water or food for days, began vomiting, went into sepsis shock and after receiving emergency treatment from U.S. Border Patrol Emergency Response Technicians (EMTs), air paramedics and emergency room personnel, died,\" according to a DHS statement.\n\nDangerous journey\n\nCBP said it will investigate the death.\n\nDuring a call with reporters on Friday, a CBP official repeated what DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also said in a statement overnight: that the journey is dangerous, and the family \"chose to cross ... illegally.\"\n\n\"Sometimes aliens do die in the desert,\" the CBP official, who declined to be named, told reporters.\n\nHowever, Jakelin didn't die in the desert; she died in CBP custody.\n\nA Guatemalan official told Univision that the autopsy has not yet been done, meaning no cause of death has been determined.\n\nHere's what is known of her final day:\n\nAmong the questions for CBP is the potential language barrier between the girl's father and border officials, who said they provided Spanish-language assistance to the group.\n\nTekandi Paniagua Flores, the Guatemalan consul in Del Rio, Texas, told Univision they have been in touch with the girl's father. He said the man speaks Ke'chi, also called Q'eqchi', a Mayan language spoken by about 800,000 people in parts of Guatemala and Belize. The consulate provided services to him in his native language.\n\nThe CBP official told reporters on Friday that the father was asked questions in Spanish in order to fill out a form in English. There was no mention of an interpreter for Q'eqchi'.\n\nDHS and CBP, in response to a VOA inquiry regarding the potential language barrier, provided a statement that did not address the language question but noted the start of the inspector general's investigation.\n\nIn the statement, CBP also said it is reviewing its \"notification policies on deaths to the public and Congress\" amid questions about why the agency did not disclose Jakelin's death until a Washington Post story was published this week, and why Commissioner Kevin McAleenan did not mention the girl's death during his congressional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 11.\n\nDeaths in the desert\n\nDeaths in CBP custody are rare, according to the agency's last report to Congress, as mandated by law, which included data for fiscal 2015. That year, the report said 10 people died as a result of use of force by CBP officials. Additionally, one person who died while in custody had a pre-existing medical condition, another committed suicide in a CBP holding facility, and a third died from heatstroke after being apprehended by CBP agents.\n\nVOA requested updated information from DHS and CBP about the number of deaths in CBP custody for the past three years.\n\nDHS assistant press secretary Katie Waldman responded with the number of rescues Border Protection officials have performed in the last year, but did not include the number of deaths in custody.\n\nA follow-up email regarding the questions about deaths in CBP custody went unanswered.\n\nCBP does find bodies while patrolling the Southwest border. The agency maintains data of \"Southwest Border Deaths by Fiscal Year\" on its website. However, it is unclear if that number includes deaths in custody or only bodies found along the border by CBP officials.\n\nDHS and CBP did not respond Friday to a request to clarify that data.\n\nIn fiscal 2017, CBP documented 294 border deaths. That figure peaked in fiscal 2005 with 492, and more recently in fiscal 2012 with 471, but has hovered between 250 and 350 since then."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Kentucky Court: Unseal Testimony of OxyContin Maker", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/kentucky-court-unseal-testimony-of-oxycontin-maker-/4701903.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "A Kentucky appeals court says the secret testimony from a former president of one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of dangerously addictive opioid painkillers must be released to the public.\n\nA three-judge panel ruled Friday the deposition of Richard Sackler must be unsealed, along with about 17 million pages of other documents that were part of Kentucky\u2019s complex lawsuit against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma. The testimony could reveal more information about what company officials knew about the drug when they were selling it.\n\nPurdue to appeal\n\nThe documents will not be released immediately. The appeals court upheld a lower court ruling, which ordered the release but said the documents would stay sealed as long as there is a pending court challenge. Friday, Purdue Pharma spokesman Robert Josephson said the company was disappointed with the decision and intends to appeal.\n\n\u201cThe documents in question were never entered into evidence and did not play a role in any judicial decision. Under Kentucky law, such documents should remain private,\u201d Josephson said.\n\nThe ruling is a victory for STAT, a national health publication owned by Boston Globe Media. Jon Fleischaker, an attorney for STAT, said it\u2019s important for the public to know about the behavior of Purdue Pharma and to examine why the state settled the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe public does not have to show a particular interest, a particular need to know. It\u2019s got a right to know. Period. And that\u2019s an important fact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u200bWave of addiction\n\nSackler is a former president of Purdue Pharma and is a member of the family that still controls the privately held company. Purdue Pharma marketed OxyContin for its ability to slowly release its effects over a 12 hour period, which it claimed made it less addictive and safer for patients. But users discovered they could bypass the time-release qualities by crushing it.\n\nThe pill, along with other opioid-based painkillers, unleased a wave of addiction across Appalachia. Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio now have among the highest overdose death rates in the country. In Kentucky, 1,565 people died from a drug overdose in 2017, a 40 percent increase in the past five years.\n\nIn 2007, Kentucky sued Purdue Pharma, claiming its deceptive marketing practices contributed to the opioid epidemic. The case settled in 2015 for $24 million. After the settlement, The Associated Press and STAT were among news outlets that sought copies of Sackler\u2019s deposition through the state\u2019s open records law. But the state denied those requests, citing an agreement with Purdue Pharma to seal all records in the case.\n\nSTAT sued. In 2016, a state judge ordered the documents unsealed. Lawyers for Purdue appealed that decision, arguing the only reason the company agreed to hand over information and offer Sackler\u2019s testimony is because they were assured the documents would never be made public. They said releasing the documents would betray that trust and make it difficult for other civil lawsuits in the future.\n\nFriday, the appeals court disagreed.\n\nProperty of the people\n\n\u201cEvery claim of the Commonwealth against another, including the claim against Purdue, is the property of the people regarding which the public has a legitimate concern,\u201d Judge Glenn E. Acree wrote for the court. \u201cOn that basis, the right of access supersedes even the right to privacy.\u201d\n\nOxyContin has been the world\u2019s top-selling opioid painkiller, generating billions of dollars for Purdue Pharma.

He held a five-minute news conference in Madison shortly after the signing to accuse Walker of ignoring the will of the voters.\n\n\u201cPeople will remember he took a stand that was not reflective of this last election,\u201d Evers said. \u201cI will be reviewing our options and do everything we can to make sure the people of this state are not ignored or overlooked.\u201d\n\nEvers didn\u2019t elaborate and left without taking questions.\n\nWalker, speaking after he signed the bills, brushed aside what he called \u201chigh-pitched hysteria\u201d from critics of the legislation. He said his legacy will be the record he left behind that includes all-but eliminating collective bargaining for public workers, not the lame-duck measures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put in deep roots that have helped the state grow,\u201d Walker said. \u201cYou want to talk about legacy, to me, that\u2019s the legacy.\u201d\n\nLawsuit promised on voting change\n\nHolder\u2019s group, the National Redistricting Foundation, along with the liberal One Wisconsin Now, promised a swift legal challenge to one provision Walker signed limiting early voting.\n\nHolder, in a statement, called it a \u201cshameful attack on our democracy.\u201d\n\nHolder\u2019s group and One Wisconsin Now successfully sued in federal court in 2016 to overturn similar early voting and other restrictions enacted by Walker.\n\nThe Wisconsin bills focus on numerous Republican priorities, including restricting early in-person voting to two weeks before an election, down from as much as nearly seven weeks in the overwhelmingly Democratic cities of Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nThe legislation also shields the state\u2019s job-creation agency from Evers\u2019 control until September and limits his ability to enact administrative rules. The measures also would block Evers from withdrawing Wisconsin from a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, one of his central campaign promises.\n\nThe legislation imposes a work requirement for BadgerCare health insurance recipients, which Walker won federal approval to do earlier this year, and prevents Evers from seeking to undo it.\n\nAttorney general restricted\n\nIt eliminates the state Department of Justice\u2019s solicitor general\u2019s office, which outgoing Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel used to launch contentious partisan litigation. Doing away with it ensures Democratic-Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul can\u2019t use the office to challenge Republican-authored laws.\n\nThe bills also allow lawmakers to intervene in lawsuits, ensuring Republicans will be able to defend their policies and laws in court if Kaul refuses to do it. Kaul also would need approval from the Legislature\u2019s budget-writing committee before he can reach any settlements, further increasing the power of that GOP-controlled panel.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature introduced and passed the bills less than five days after unveiling them late on a Friday afternoon two weeks ago. Outraged Democrats accused the GOP of a power grab that undermined the results of the November election. Evers and others have argued Walker will tarnish his legacy by signing the bills, and Kaul has predicted multiple lawsuits challenging the legislation.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders countered that they were merely trying to balance the power of the executive and legislative branches. They said they wanted to ensure Evers must negotiate with them rather than issue executive orders to undo their policy achievements.\n\nRepublican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said by signing the bills, Walker was \u201cacknowledging the importance of the Legislature as a co-equal branch of government.\u201d\n\nWalker uses power new bills take away\n\nWalker\u2019s signing of the bills comes a day after he announced a $28 million incentive package to keep open a Kimberly-Clark Corp. plant in northeast Wisconsin. One of the lame-duck bills would prevent Evers from making such a deal, instead requiring the Legislature\u2019s budget committee to sign off."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Picks Mulvaney as Acting Chief of Staff", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-mulvaney-acting-chief-of-staff-/4701510.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Ending a sustained period of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday named the head of the largest entity within his executive office to become his acting chief of staff, replacing retired Marine Gen. John Kelly.\n\nMulvaney, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina and known as a fiscal hawk, besides running OMB has also been the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he scaled back.\n\nMulvaney tweeted about his new job: \"This is a tremendous honor. I look forward to working with the President and the entire team. It\u2019s going to be a great 2019!\"\n\nThe position of White House chief of staff has traditionally been very important and powerful, akin to the chief operating officer of the country and gatekeeper to the Oval Office.\n\nBut the two men who have held the position in the Trump administration, Reince Priebus and Kelly, have found it frustrating. Their authority has been repeatedly undercut by the president, as well as other top administration officials, especially presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom hold senior positions in the West Wing.\n\nIt was unclear why Trump named Mulvaney as only acting chief of staff.\n\n\"There's no time limit. He's the acting chief of staff, which means he's the chief of staff. He got picked because the president liked him \u2014 they get along,\" a senior White House official said.\n\n\n\n'That's what the president wants'\n\nAsked why Trump was implying Mulvaney's time in the job might be only temporary, the official replied, \"Because that's what the president wants.\"\n\nAnother senior administration official confirmed that \"it's what the president wants right now.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House officials also said Trump chose Mulvaney because of his experience on Capitol Hill and his reputation for being fiscally responsible.\n\nLater on Twitter, the president responded to media reports that there were few if any qualified candidates eager to take the high-stress position, especially a long-term commitment:\n\nA senior official said that Kelly, who Trump earlier had announced would be leaving by the end of the year, was pleased with the choice of Mulvaney.\n\n\"The current chief is happy. The current chief is fine. The current chief will stay till the end of the year,\" the official said.\n\nAt first, White House officials said Russ Vought, currently the No. 2 official at OMB, would succeed Mulvaney as director there.\n\nBut later, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"Mick Mulvaney will not resign from the Office of Management and Budget, but will spend all of his time devoted to his role as the acting chief of staff for the president. Russ Vought will handle day-to-day operations and run OMB.\"\n\nFor weeks, there had been consistent and inaccurate media speculation as to who was likely to succeed Kelly, including Kushner; the vice president's outgoing chief of staff, Nick Ayers; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina; and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nEventually, Ayers, Meadows and Christie all publicly said they were not interested in the job.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has a reputation for a higher rate of staff turnover than its predecessors, Kelly's total time of 16 months in the job will not be unusually short in a high-stress position where two years is considered a decent run. Priebus lasted just six months.\n\nWith Mulvaney poised to take the job on an interim basis, Trump could have four chiefs of staff within a little more than two years.\n\nIn January 2012, then-businessman Trump harshly criticized then-President Barack Obama for having three chiefs of staff in less than three years, saying that was a reason the Democrat was not having success with his legislative agenda."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Pompeo: US to Hold Saudi Journalist's Killers Accountable", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pompeo-us-to-hold-saudi-journalist-s-killers-accountable/4701412.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that he had noted the historic rebuke of longtime ally Saudi Arabia by U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution to end American support for the kingdom's military intervention in Yemen's civil war and another measure condemning the killing of a dissident Saudi journalist.\n\n\n\n\"We saw the vote yesterday.

Moments later, it adopted the second resolution by a voice vote. In both cases, the chamber acted in defiance of the Trump administration, which has strenuously argued against a rupture of cooperation between Washington and Riyadh.\n\n\"Yemen is now experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world,\" Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders said. \"The United States has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. We have been providing the bombs that Saudi Arabia is using, refueling the planes that drop those bombs and assisting with intelligence.\"\n\n\n\n7 GOP votes\n\nSeven Republicans joined a unified Democratic caucus in backing the initial Yemen-related resolution, which asserts Congress' constitutional duty to declare war and approve prolonged U.S. military engagements. The U.S. legislature has not authorized America's support role in Saudi Arabia's campaign to combat Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels, a conflict that has led to widespread civilian deaths.\n\n\n\nBut some argued that, in this instance, the case for asserting war powers authority is weak.\n\n\n\n\"The United States is not involved in combat [in Yemen]. It is not dropping ordnance. It is no longer even providing air-to-air refueling [for Saudi warplanes],\" Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said. \"If the Senate wants to pick a constitutional fight with the executive branch over war powers, I would advise my colleagues to pick a better case.\"\n\nWATCH: US Senate Votes to End Support for Saudi War Effort in Yemen\n\n\"If we set the precedent that even an operation such as the refueling of aircraft of allied countries needs congressional authority, we would severely limit the executive branch's ability to respond to international crises and safeguard our global national security interests,\" Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan said.\n\n\n\nThat argument did not sway resolution co-author Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, who countered that direct U.S. support for Saudi military actions constitutes unambiguous involvement in the war in Yemen.\n\n\n\n\"We're involved in this conflict as co-belligerents [with Saudi Arabia],\" Lee said.\n\n\n\nLargely symbolic\n\nWhile the Senate resolution sends a strong signal of displeasure to Saudi Arabia, it is likely to stand as a largely symbolic gesture for now. Swift House action became less likely after the chamber advanced a rule blocking a vote on any war powers resolution relating to Yemen for the remainder of the current Congress.\n\n\n\n\"You look at the humanitarian crisis in Yemen today, and it wasn't started by the Saudi air campaign,\" Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger said. \"It was started by the Houthi rebels and denial of access for food overthrowing the legitimate government.\"\n\nCongressional ire toward Saudi Arabia had been simmering for years as Yemen's civil war dragged on with ever-higher civilian death tolls. Anger spiked sharply after dissident Saudi journalist Khashoggi was killed at the kingdom's consulate in Turkey two months ago.\n\n\n\nThe second resolution approved by the Senate blames Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi's death, expresses support for Yemeni peace talks and states: \"There is no statutory authorization for United States involvement in hostilities in the Yemen civil war.\"\n\nTrump notes Riyadh denials\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said that responsibility for Khashoggi's death remains an open question, and noted Riyadh's repeated denials that the kingdom's crown prince played a role.\n\n\n\nTrump's critics in the Senate slammed the White House's posture.\n\n\n\n\"This administration is putting the Saudi government on a pedestal that stands above American values,\" New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez said. \"They continue to extend a blank check to certain players within the Saudi government, no matter how brazen their actions.\"\n\nWayne Lee contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "McCain Replacement Senator Jon Kyl Resigning at Year's End", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/john-mccain-replacement-senator-jon-kyl-resigning-at-years-end/4701282.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Senator Jon Kyl announced his resignation Friday from the seat he was appointed to less than four months ago following the death of John McCain, giving Republican Arizona Govenor Doug Ducey a second opportunity to fill the slot.\n\nKyl, 76, had said he was only serving through the end of the year. His resignation is effective Dec. 31 and forces a pivotal decision by the state's Republican governor.\n\nThat's because voters in 2020 will get to decide who fills McCain's seat for the final two years of its six-year term. Democrats picked up Arizona's other Senate seat in November and are already targeting the state in 2020 as part of their possible path to re-taking control of the Senate, increasing the pressure on Ducey to select someone who can hold the seat for the GOP.\n\nDucey said he will pick a replacement \"in the near future.\" His office has been typically tight-lipped about who might fill the seat, leading to wild speculation in Arizona and Washington.\n\nOne of the most often-mentioned names is Ducey's chief of staff, Kirk Adams, a onetime state lawmaker who resigned from the governor's office on Nov. 26 and whose last day working for Ducey is Friday.\n\nEileen Klein, whom Ducey appointed as Arizona's state treasurer last year, is another possibility.

Those testing the waters include U.S. Representative Ruben Gallego, former astronaut and gun control advocate Mark Kelly and former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a onetime McCain chief of staff who became a Democrat this year and a top Sinema booster.\n\nDucey's selection of the well-respected Kyl following McCain's Aug. 25 death allowed him to dodge a possible controversial pick during his own re-election campaign. But Kyl, who had previously served in the Senate for Arizona, made it clear he only agreed to the appointment out of a sense of duty and had no plans to stay in the job for long.\n\nKyl's brief resignation letter said he decided to resign at the end of 2018 so that Ducey's new appointee \"can begin the new term with all other senators in January 2019 and can serve a full two (potentially four) years.\"\n\nKyl noted that when he accepted Ducey's appointment that he agreed to serve through December and then re-evaluate whether to serve longer.\n\n\"Senator Kyl didn't need to return to the Senate,\" Ducey said in a statement. \"His legacy as one of Arizona's most influential and important political figures was already without question.

Each site will employ around 25,000 people.\n\nCities are eager to bring in more tech employers because companies like Apple and Amazon ladle out six-figure salaries to engineers and other skilled workers.\n\nThe infusion of thousands of new and highly paid residents can ripple through an economy, with those employees filling restaurants, theaters, buying property and paying taxes.\n\nAnnual pay will vary at the new locations, but Apple workers in Cupertino have an average annual salary of about $125,000, according to a report the company submitted to the city."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Virgin Galactic's New Flight Test to Soar Closer to Edge of Space", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/virgin-galactic-new-flight-test-to-soar-closer-to-edge-of-space/4698177.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Virgin Galactic is preparing for a new flight test Thursday that aims to fly higher and faster than before toward the edge of space.\n\nThe U.S. company run by British tycoon Richard Branson is aiming to be the first to take tourists on brief trips into microgravity.\n\nVirgin Galactic's fourth flight test on the VSS Unity is scheduled for Thursday, weather permitting.\n\nThe flight will take off from a spaceport in Mojave, California.\n\nThe vessel does not launch from Earth but is carried to a higher altitude \u2014 about nine miles (15 kilometers) high \u2014 attached to an airplane.\n\nThen, two pilots on the VSS Unity fire the engines toward the frontier of space, typically defined as an altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers).\n\nIn July, after burning the rocket motor for 42 seconds, the VSS Unity reached a height of 32 miles, a part of the atmosphere called the mesosphere.\n\nCommercial airplanes typically fly at an altitude of about six miles.\n\nThe VSS Unity reached a top speed of over 1,530 miles per hour, or beyond Mach 2.\n\n\"Overall the goal of this flight is to fly higher and faster than previous flights,\" said a statement from Virgin Galactic.\n\n\"If all goes to plan our pilots will experience an extended period of microgravity as VSS Unity coasts to apogee, although \u2014 being pilots \u2014 they will remain securely strapped in throughout.\"\n\nAnother U.S. rocket company, Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is also racing to be the first to send tourists to space, but using a small rocket to get there.\n\nVirgin's first flight date has been pushed back multiple times, following a test flight accident that killed a co-pilot in 2014.\n\nBranson told CNN in November he hoped to send people to space \"before Christmas.\"\n\nMore than 600 clients have already paid $250,000 for a ticket."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "OMG: California Regulators Consider Charge on Text Messaging", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/california-regulators-consider-charge-on-text-messaging/4697986.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "California regulators are considering a plan to charge a fee for text messaging on mobile phones to help support programs that make phone service accessible to the poor.\n\nThe Mercury News reports Wednesday that the proposal is scheduled for a vote next month by the state Public Utilities Commission.\n\nThe wireless industry and business groups have been working to defeat the plan.\n\nJim Wunderman of the Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored advocacy group, says it would essentially put a tax on conversations.\n\nThe newspaper says it's unclear how much money individual consumers would be asked to pay their wireless carrier for texting services under the proposal.

Tunisia leads the northern Africa region in women\u2019s rights and government representation, but at least 47 percent of the country\u2019s women are affected by domestic violence. Law 58, which took effect in February, offered sweeping protections from physical, economic and psychological abuse, and even outlawed harassment in public.\n\nBut nongovernmental organizations, government officials and survivors of domestic violence who met late last month to assess how the law is being implemented reported a host of shortcomings, from logistical barriers that prevent some women from filing complaints to social pressures that keep others from even trying.\n\nOne woman told the conference of the trouble she faced when filing a report against her husband for assault and economic exploitation. She said police at a local station sent her to a district office so she could file the complaint with a specialized unit, but authorities there turned her away. She eventually managed to take her case to court, but said she was disappointed when the judge only fined her husband 300 dinar, or roughly $100.\n\nThe story illustrates some of the common problems women in Tunisia have been facing as they seek protection under a law that seemed perfect on paper.\n\n\n\nHurdles To Reporting\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to reporting crimes under the new law is the lack of agents trained to handle them, conference participants said.\n\nNabiha Gaddechi, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said 264 agents have completed training and hundreds more are in the pipeline. But the new units specializing in violence against women are still short-staffed, causing hiccups in the report-filing process.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Tunisian Parliament in October 2017.\n\nWomen who head to their local police station to file domestic violence reports are often sent to district offices, which tend to be located in less accessible areas, Gaddechi said. Once there, she added, victims often aren\u2019t offered a private space to file their reports and must do so in the open, sometimes among criminal suspects awaiting processing. Women also can\u2019t file reports at night, which is when most incidents of violence occur. Gaddechi attributed these problems to a lack of staff.\n\nConference participants said there are also many social norms that may lead people to tolerate or even justify violence against women.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs is monitoring whether religious messages are interfering with the application of the law, according to spokesman Slim Bencheikh. However, some agents have abused their power and pressured women against taking their spouses to court, Gaddechi said. She pointed out that this is a clear violation of the law, which states that \u201cany agent who is a part of the specialized unit for investigations into violent offenses against women and who voluntarily exerts pressure, or any sort of coercion, on victims for the purpose of making them give up their rights, change their complaint, or retract it will be punished by one to six (6) months in prison.\u201d\n\nTrouble In The Courts\n\nWomen continue to face challenges, even if they successfully file a report.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many specialized courts equipped to handle cases related to violence against women, said Raoudha Garafi, a court magistrate. Others noted how hard it is for some women to afford a lawyer.\n\nSana Ben Achour, the president of Association Beity, which runs women\u2019s shelters, said there were many reasons to consider punishing offenders in ways that don\u2019t include prison sentences. For one thing, conference participants pointed out, some women end up dropping charges against their husbands because they\u2019re afraid of being left as the only caretaker in their home.\n\nBen Achour said there were also problems with prisons.\n\n\u201cPrison has a positive, deterrent effect when it comes to fighting impunity, but it is also a problem because Tunisian prisons fail to have the corrective role they are supposed to,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the contrary, prisoners come out of them even more hateful.\u201d\n\nSome Good News\n\nDespite the hurdles, some progress has been made in the last year. The Ministry of Women, Family, Childhood, and Seniors set up shelters and listening centers for survivors of domestic violence around the country. A hospital in Tunis has also been equipped with new technology that makes it easier for medical staff to detect evidence of domestic abuse.\n\nParticipants at the meeting drafted recommendations for authorities and vowed to work together to improve the landmark law.\n\nIn the meantime, women\u2019s rights groups are also turning their attention to two new pieces of legislation that parliament is expected to vote on in coming weeks: an amendment that would make Tunisia the first country in the region to offer women equal inheritance to men, and a bill that would extend maternity and paternity leave for parents."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Myanmar Debates Women\u2019s Rights Amid Evidence Of Pervasive Sexual And Domestic Violence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myanmar-womens-rights-violence_us_5c113be9e4b03a134dc1c8f8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "By Stephanie Miedema and Tharaphi Than\n\nFor years, feminists in Myanmar have been fighting to gain even the most basic legal rights for women.\n\nSpousal abuse is still legal in the isolated country formerly known as Burma. Even criminal sexual assault is rarely punished.\n\nActivists\u2019 patient efforts to change that are starting to pay off.\n\nIn late November, officials announced that the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act, long stalled in parliament, may finally be passed in 2019. The bill would protect women from domestic violence, marital rape, sexual violence and workplace harassment, and provide legal and medical support to survivors.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge victory for the pioneering women\u2019s rights groups that helped draft the legislation first proposed in 2013.\n\nBut as revealed in our on-the-ground research on violence against women and gender inequality in Myanmar, the law is not the only thing that needs changing to keep its women safe.\n\nIntimate partner violence is common\n\nAcross the globe, violence against women \u2013 whether physical, sexual or psychological \u2014 is most likely to be perpetrated by their husband or boyfriend.\n\nThirty percent of women worldwide will be abused by a male partner during their lifetime, and the proportion is as high as 68 percent in some countries.\n\nData on intimate partner violence in Myanmar \u2014 which is run by a semi-authoritarian, military-heavy regime \u2014 is slim. But in 2016 the U.S.-funded Demographic and Health Survey, which is conducted in some 100 countries every five years, found that 21 percent of women there reported experiencing physical, sexual or psychological violence at the hands of an intimate partner, particularly slapping, pushing, choking and attacks with weapons.\n\nThe real percentage is likely much higher. Surveys on intimate partner violence typically produce lower-than-actual numbers, in part because many women don\u2019t feel comfortable or safe talking about assault.\n\nAccording to Legal Clinic Myanmar, a charity based in Yangon, 68 percent of the cases they attended in May 2018 concerned gender-based violence.\n\nEvidence also shows that women are more likely to experience violence in countries with high gender inequality. Myanmar ranks 106 of 189 countries in the U.N. Gender Inequality Index.\n\nAP Photo/Altaf Qadri A Rohingya refugee who fled Myanmar. She has convinced her husband to let their eldest daughter study.\n\nOur research sheds light on a high-profile U.N. report released in August, which documented widespread rape and sexual slavery in Myanmar\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Muslim Rohingya people.\n\nThe findings were disturbing. But, for us, they were not surprising. Violence against women is a silent emergency in all Myanmar.\n\nA false belief in gender equality\n\nUnequal gender relations in Myanmar stem from \u201chpon,\u201d a deeply held social belief that considers men to be holy, glorious and spiritually superior. Women are associated with ill omens and bad luck.\n\nHpon translates into both subtle and overt segregation by gender in Myanmar.\n\nPolitics is almost exclusively the domain of men, with women making up around 10 percent of national and state legislatures. In contrast, the male-dominated Myanmar military is guaranteed 25 percent of seats in all governing bodies.\n\nAP Photo/Thein Zaw Buddhism and the military are Myanmar\u2019s two biggest institutions. Both are male dominated.\n\nWomen in this Buddhist-majority country are not allowed to access certain religious spaces. Their garments are washed separately, so as not to contaminate men\u2019s clothing.\n\nThough hpon devalues women, we have found in interviews that people in Myanmar think that men and women enjoy equal status.\n\nThey point to women and men\u2019s relatively equal education levels, for example, or observe that women get to keep their last names after marriage. Women in Myanmar can also travel freely without a male escort, giving them relative independence compared to women in neighboring South Asian countries.\n\nPositive views of gender equality in Myanmar also celebrate a few very high-achieving women \u2014 most of them from upper-class backgrounds.\n\nThese exceptional figures include Queen Shin Saw Pu, who reigned the Mon Kingdom from 1453 to 1472, the 20th-century education campaigner Daw Mya Sein and leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 2015.\n\nDamir Sagolj/Pool Photo via AP Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi (left, with Chinese President Xi Jinping) is often cited as an example that women have equal opportunity in Myanmar.\n\nBlaming the victim\n\nBut the success of a few is not the same as equality for all.\n\nThe misperception of gender equality in Myanmar can actually make life harder for women who are seen to fall short of these high ideals, we found, because they feel like deviants in an otherwise equal and peaceful society.\n\nAfter a Myanmar model sued her boyfriend for rape in September 2018 \u2014 a very rare legal challenge in Myanmar \u2014 she was viciously attacked on social media, where she was called a \u201cprostitute\u201d and a \u201cwoman of low morals.\u201d She received hate mail suggesting she was better off dead.\n\nThe social stigma against sexual abuse and harassment in Myanmar society means most abuse survivors never report their experiences.\n\nMany women we interviewed have kept silent about domestic violence because they believe friends and family would say it was their \u201cwifely duty\u201d to be patient and quiet.\n\nOthers feared retaliation if they made their abuse known.\n\nGender inequality in Myanmar also limits women\u2019s ability to leave abusive relationships. Many women are financially and socially dependent on their partners, and would face social isolation, stigma and financial insecurity if they fled.\n\nMale-dominated institutions\n\nSince men dominate Myanmar\u2019s political, legal and criminal justice institutions, women also fear that reporting domestic violence will not protect them.\n\nOnly 1 percent of women who seek help after physical or sexual violence go to the police, according to the Demographic and Health Survey.\n\nWhen they do, they are not often believed.\n\nOne woman we spoke with said that she reported her violent husband to law enforcement, only to have her case dismissed. She said her husband paid the local police to ignore her.\n\nMyanmar society also typically turns a blind eye toward sexual abuse by soldiers and Buddhist monks, members of the country\u2019s two most powerful institutions.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s fitful transition from dictatorship toward democracy in recent years is giving women the opportunity, for the first time in history, to fight for their legal rights.\n\nIf the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act is passed next year, it will not fix the entrenched gender inequality that makes Myanmar women vulnerable to sexual violence.\n\nBut it is a critical step in the right direction.\n\nStephanie Miedema is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Emory University.

Also on the hackers\u2019 hit list: high-profile defenders, detractors and enforcers of the nuclear deal struck between Washington and Tehran, as well as Arab atomic scientists, Iranian civil society figures and D.C. think tank employees.\n\n\u201cPresumably, some of this is about figuring out what is going on with sanctions,\u201d said Frederick Kagan, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has written about Iranian cyberespionage and was among those targeted.\n\nKagan said he was alarmed by the targeting of foreign nuclear experts.\n\n\u201cThis is a little more worrisome than I would have expected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hit list surfaced after Charming Kitten mistakenly left one of its servers open to the internet last month. Researchers at Certfa found the server and extracted a list of 77 Gmail and Yahoo addresses targeted by the hackers that they handed to the AP for further analysis. Although those addresses likely represent only a fraction of the hackers\u2019 overall effort \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear how many of the accounts were successfully compromised \u2014 they still provide considerable insight into Tehran\u2019s espionage priorities.\n\n\u201cThe targets are very specific,\u201d Certfa researcher Nariman Gharib said.\n\nAP Photo/Raphael Satter Certfa researchers Nariman Gharib, left, and Amin Sabeti, shown at a cafe in London on Dec. 7, 2018. Certfa helped uncover the Charming Kitten campaign.\n\nIn a report published Thursday, Cerfta tied the hackers to the Iranian government, a judgment drawn in part on operational blunders, including a couple of cases where the hackers appeared to have accidentally revealed that they were operating from computers inside Iran. The assessment was backed by others who have tracked Charming Kitten. Allison Wikoff, a researcher with Atlanta-based Secureworks, recognized some of the digital infrastructure in Certfa\u2019s report and said the hackers\u2019 past operations left little doubt they were government-backed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear-cut,\u201d she said.\n\nCalls to Iranian officials were not returned late Wednesday, the beginning of the weekend in the country.\n\nIran has previously denied responsibility for hacking operations, but an AP analysis of its targets suggests that Charming Kitten is working in close alignment with the Islamic Republic\u2019s interests. The most striking among them were the nuclear officials \u2014 a scientist working on a civilian nuclear project for the Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Defense, a senior operator at the Research and Training Reactor in the Jordanian city of Ramtha, and a high-ranking researcher at the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria.\n\nThe trio suggested a general interest in nuclear technology and administration. Others on the hit list \u2014 such as Guy Roberts, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs \u2014 pointed to an eagerness to keep track of officials charged with overseeing America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been worried about,\u201d Roberts said when alerted to his presence on the list.\n\nStill more targets are connected to the Iran deal \u2014 a 2015 pact negotiated by former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and other world powers that called for Tehran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump tore up the deal in May over the objections of most of America\u2019s allies and has re-imposed a series of punishing restrictions on Iran since.\n\nOne of Charming Kitten\u2019s targets was Andrew J. Grotto, whose tenure on the U.S. National Security Council straddled the Obama and Trump administrations and who has written about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nJarrett Blanc, the State Department coordinator responsible for the implementation of the nuclear deal under Obama, was also on the list. He said news of his targeting was no shock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve retained contact with Iranian counterparts since leaving government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if there were not Iranian groups trying to hack into my various email accounts.\u201d\n\nLike the Russian hackers who have chased after America\u2019s drone, space and submarine secrets, the list indicates that Iranian spies were also interested in the world of U.S. defense companies. One of those targeted is a senior director of \u201cbreakthrough technology\u201d at the aerospace arm of Honeywell International Inc., the New Jersey-based industrial conglomerate; another is a vice president at Virginia-based Science Applications International Corp., a prominent Pentagon contractor.\n\nHoneywell said it was aware that one of its employees had their personal account \u201cexposed,\u201d adding that there was no evidence that the company\u2019s network was compromised. SAIC said it found no trace of any hacking attempt against its employee\u2019s account.\n\nThere were Iranian targets too, including media workers, an agronomist and a senior employee of the country\u2019s Department of Environment \u2014 a possible sign that Tehran\u2019s crackdown on environmentalists, which began earlier this year, continues apace.\n\nHacking has long been a feature of the tense relationship between the United States and Iran, whose militant brand of Shia Islam has challenged American interests in the Middle East since 1979.\n\nIt was against Iran that U.S. and Israeli spies are said to have deployed the pioneering, centrifuge-rattling computer worm dubbed Stuxnet in a bid to sabotage the country\u2019s uranium enrichment capabilities. Iranian hackers in turn are blamed for denial of service assaults on American banks and computer-wrecking cyberattacks in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s regional archrival.\n\nThe Charming Kitten campaign uncovered by Certfa is far less sophisticated, generally relying on a password-stealing technique called phishing. Two Nov. 17 emails provided to the AP by Jim Sisco of Enodo Global Inc., a Virginia-based risk advisory firm that was targeted by Charming Kitten, mimic the look and feel of Gmail security alerts, a technique used by hackers across the globe.\n\nAn analysis of Certfa\u2019s data shows the group targeted at least 13 U.S. Treasury employees\u2019 personal emails, including one belonging to a director at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which fights money laundering and terror financing, and one used by the Iran licensing chief at the Office of Foreign Asset Control, which is in charge of enforcing U.S. sanctions. But a few employees\u2019 LinkedIn profiles referenced back office jobs or routine tax work.\n\nThat suggested \u201ca fairly scattershot attempt,\u201d said Clay Stevenson, a former Treasury official who now consults on sanctions and was himself targeted by Charming Kitten.\n\nOthers\u2019 experience suggests a more professional effort.\n\nGeorgetown University professor and South Asia security expert Christine Fair said she had only recently returned from a conference in Afghanistan attended by Iranian officials and a visit to the Iranian border when she learned she was in the hackers\u2019 sights.\n\n\u201cThe timing is uncanny,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother Charming Kitten target was an intern working for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that has been one of the Iran deal\u2019s fiercest critics. How the intern \u2014 whose email isn\u2019t public and whose name appears nowhere on the organization\u2019s website \u2014 crossed the hackers\u2019 radar is not clear. The foundation issued a statement calling the revelation \u201cyet another indicator that Iran must be viewed as a nefarious actor in all theatres in which it operates.\u201d\n\nKagan, the scholar, said most signs pointed to a serious, state-backed operation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like freelancers,\u201d he said.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Detention Of 2 Canadians Raises Stakes In China-U.S.-Canada Dispute", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/detention-of-2-canadians-raises-stakes-in-china-us-canada-dispute_us_5c123049e4b0835fe326d084", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of \u201cengaging in activities that endanger the national security\u201d of China.\n\nLu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living.\n\n\u201cThe legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,\u201d Lu told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The U.S. has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud.\n\nCanadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor \u201csince he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,\u201d Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume B\u00e9rub\u00e9 said Wednesday. \u201cWe are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government.\u201d\n\nKovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong.\n\nSpavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North\u2019s government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North\u2019s capital Pyongyang in 2013.\n\nAcquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up.\n\nThe detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt\u2019s detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada\u2019s arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the U.S.\n\nThe broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe root of the dispute appears to be Canada\u2019s arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The U.S. accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nChina earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn\u2019t released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of \u201cretaliatory measures\u201d if Canada doesn\u2019t free Meng.\n\n\u201cIf Canada extradites Meng to the U.S., China\u2019s revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,\u201d Hu Xijin said, speaking in English.\n\nCanada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters.\n\nThe United States and China have emphasized that China-U.S. trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction Tuesday, saying he\u2019d intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China.\n\n\u201cIf I think it\u2019s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made \u2014 which is a very important thing \u2014 what\u2019s good for national security \u2014 I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,\u201d Trump told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump\u2019s assertion, saying: \u201cRegardless of what goes on in other countries, Canada is, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was \u201cquite obvious\u201d any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure \u201cthe process is not politicized.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,\u201d said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the U.S.\u2018s reputation as a country that follows the \u2018rule of law,\u2019 and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea.\n\nU.S. regulators planned to bar it from receiving U.S. components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because U.S. tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations.\n\nSpeaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what he actually decides,\u201d Ross said. \u201cLet\u2019s see where we go from there.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Mick Mulvaney Trashes 'Terrible' Donald Trump In Newly Resurfaced Video", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mick-mulvaney-donald-trump-criticism_us_5c14b101e4b05d7e5d823e20", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Donald Trump\u2019s next acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, may have said he was looking forward \u201cto working with the president and the entire team\u201d in this tweet on Friday:\n\nThis is a tremendous honor.

Those officials contended that the entire law should be stricken because Congress earlier this year repealed the fines known as \u201cshared responsibility payments\u201d that people without health coverage had to pay under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate. O\u2019Connor agreed.\n\n\u201cThe court finds the individual mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power and is still impermissible under the interstate commerce clause \u2015 meaning the individual mandate is unconstitutional\u2026. [T]he court finds the individual mandate is essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote in his opinion.\n\nIf the ruling stands, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance regulations would disappear and, along with them, the health coverage for millions of people who gained private insurance or Medicaid coverage under the 2010 law signed by President Barack Obama. Specifically, the law\u2019s guarantee of coverage for people regardless of their pre-existing conditions, financial assistance for private insurance, rules establishing a basic minimum set of benefits insurance policies must cover and more would vanish. Since O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling throws out the entire statute, the rest of the ACA, such as its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, also is stricken.\n\nIn short, this ruling would deal severe damage to the American health care system. It also would eradicate one of Obama\u2019s most significant accomplishments. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, eliminating the Affordable Care Act would increase the national uninsured rate by 50 percent and lead to more than 17 million people losing health coverage.\n\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the ruling in a pair of Twitter posts Friday night. \u201cAs I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions,\u201d he wrote in one post.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling does not include a stay to delay it from taking effect, so the Affordable Care Act is now technically unconstitutional. The ruling will be appealed, however, making it unlikely that the law\u2019s health insurance markets, funding and regulations will immediately go away.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA for health care, and on America\u2019s faithful progress toward affordable health care for all Americans,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a news release. \u201cThe ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court. Today\u2019s misguided ruling will not deter us: Our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d Becerra led the team of Democratic state attorneys general who defended the Affordable Care Act in the case.\n\nRich Pedroncelli/ASSOCIATED PRESS California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said, \"Today\u2019s misguided ruling will not deter us: Our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question of constitutionality is straightforward: Is the individual mandate a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s enumerated powers when the shared-responsibility payment is zero?\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cBecause the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate under Congress\u2019s tax power, the Court will begin there before proceeding to an interstate commerce clause analysis. The court finds that both plain text and Supreme Court precedent dictate that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under either provision.\u201d\n\nLiberal and conservative legal scholars alike mostly dismissed the lawsuit, known as Texas v. Azar, as unserious and unsound, making O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling somewhat surprising. AARP, along with the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and other health care groups opposed the suit. So did a bipartisan group of nine governors.\n\nDuring oral arguments in September from the GOP officials, the U.S. Justice Department and lawyers for a group of Democratic officials from 16 states and the District of Columbia, O\u2019Connor appeared to side with the plaintiffs. President George W. Bush nominated O\u2019Connor to the court in 2007.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 case was based on an interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the individual mandate as constitutional in 2012 and the Obama administration\u2019s arguments that the policy shouldn\u2019t be struck down.\n\nObama\u2019s Justice Department maintained that the mandate went hand-in-hand with the rules protecting people with pre-existing conditions and the insurance subsidies the law provides, and that the mandate could not be eliminated without scrapping the entire law. Chief Justice John Roberts based his majority opinion on the case in part on this line of reasoning when he wrote that the mandate is constitutional as part of Congress\u2019 power to tax.\n\nCongress eliminated the individual mandate\u2019s penalties as part of the tax law President Donald Trump enacted earlier this year. Because there are no longer tax penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act and because the Obama administration argued the entire law must stand or fall on that basis, the GOP officials argued Roberts\u2019 ruling no longer protects the law.\n\nO\u2019Connor found this persuasive, which he appeared to indicate during oral arguments. He cited the Roberts ruling, the Obama administration\u2019s defense in the 2012 lawsuit and his interpretation of congressional intent when lawmakers passed the ACA in 2010 and when they repealed the mandate fines this year.\n\nThe Democratic state attorneys general defending the case argued, in effect, that congressional intent in 2010 doesn\u2019t matter because Congress revisited the issue in 2017, when it passed the tax bill eliminating the mandate penalties. Congress understood very well that it would affect the health care law \u2015 the issue was part of the debate \u2015 and decided to do so anyway, the attorneys general said.\n\nA wide variety of experts, including many critical of the Affordable Care Act in the past, found that line of argument persuasive. O\u2019Connor did not. He said that it was a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to consider what Congress did in 2017, because that was a debate about a tax bill, not the health care bill itself.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department refused to defend the law in court in defiance of the federal government\u2019s normal practice when a federal statute is challenged. Instead, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his department argued that the court should eliminate only the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that protect people with pre-existing conditions. The Justice Department also asked the judge to delay the effectiveness of the ruling until after the close of this year\u2019s open enrollment period on the health insurance exchanges, which ends Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration official who oversees the exchanges confirmed Friday night that the federal government will continue to enforce the Affordable Care Act while O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling is being appealed. \u201cThe recent federal court decision is still moving through the courts, and the exchanges are still open for business and we will continue with open enrollment. There is no impact to current coverage or coverage in a 2019 plan,\u201d Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote on Twitter.\n\nThree career Justice Department attorneys removed themselves from the case shortly before the department took this position. Days later, a veteran Justice lawyer actually resigned, although he did not specify that this case was the reason why.\n\nBecause the federal government declined to defend its own law, O\u2019Connor permitted Becerra and the other Democrats to argue on behalf of the Affordable Care Act instead. These officials emphasized that if Congress had wanted to repeal the entire law, it would have done so, but legislators merely did away with the mandate penalties.\n\nRepublican officials from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin filed the lawsuit.\n\nDemocratic officials from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia defended the law.\n\nJonathan Cohn contributed to this article."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Lindsey Graham Has No Problem With Trump 'Lying About Sex'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-trump-lying-about-sex_us_5c14388ae4b009b8aea75d0a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Republican Sen.

But she also used the opportunity to argue against migrants and asylum-seekers making the journey to the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou know, this is just a very sad example of the dangers of this journey,\u201d Nielsen said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cThis family chose to cross illegally.\u201d\n\nThe girl, whose identity was revealed Friday morning, came from Guatemala with her father in a group of 163 migrants, according to DHS. She died from shock and dehydration roughly 24 hours after being brought to a hospital, the Washington Post first reported.\n\nDHS faced a flurry of condemnation after news broke of Jakelin\u2019s death late Thursday. In multiple statements, the agency argued it had done everything it could to prevent Jakelin\u2019s death in the relatively brief time she was in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nOn Dec. 6, Jakelin, her father and the rest of their group went to a closed port of entry to cross illegally into the U.S. They then turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents and were taken into custody in New Mexico.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection official told reporters that the child initially appeared well and her father signed a form stating she had no significant health problems. A Guatemalan official told Buzzfeed News that the form was in English and the father, who speaks a Mayan language, may not have understood Border Patrol agents\u2019 explanations.\n\nThey waited several hours to be transported to Lordsburg, New Mexico, and had access to water and restrooms in the meantime, officials said.\n\nDuring the three-hour bus ride, Jakelin began to vomit and suffer seizures. She had a fever of nearly 106 degrees, according to DHS. Her father said the child had not been able to consume water or food for days, the agency said in a statement.\n\nJakelin was then taken to a hospital by helicopter. She died there on Dec. 8.\n\nNielsen told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that there were complications with providing care to the child because she was part of a large group far from the processing location, again turning the blame around on the migrants.\n\n\u201cWe gave immediate care,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cWe will continue to look into the situation, but again, I cannot stress how dangerous this journey is when migrants choose to come here illegally.\u201d\n\nAlthough details about Jakelin\u2019s family\u2019s specific circumstances are not yet known, immigrant rights advocates have argued for years that border enforcement strategies drive migrants to take more dangerous routes to reach the U.S.\n\nThe number of migrant deaths rose by about 20 percent from 1998 to 2016, while the number of those captured crossing illegally plummeted 70 percent during the same period, ProPublica reported last year. A significant source of the problem is the effort by authorities to deter migrants from using \u201ceasy-to-cross, hard-to-police urban corridors,\u201d and instead push them \u201cinto barren, isolated terrain,\u201d the outlet wrote.\n\nThis year, asylum-seekers trying to ask for help at ports of entry have faced increasingly long wait times, sometimes being told they must wait in Mexico for weeks or months.\n\nThose policies contribute to people trying to get to the U.S. through other means, Amnesty International Tactical Campaigns Manager Ashley Houghton said in a statement."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Names Mick Mulvaney As Acting White House Chief Of Staff", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mick-mulvaney-chief-of-staff_us_5c0eb96be4b0edf5a3a79eae", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump has appointed Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to replace John Kelly as acting chief of staff.\n\nThe president announced the appointment Friday afternoon on Twitter.\n\nI am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction.

Tisch Center for Women\u2019s Health at NYU Langone. \u201cAnd truly, if you think you have a heart attack, you need to call 911 and not waste time going online to check your symptoms.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Goldberg\u2019s patients. A study released this week by the European Society of Cardiology found that women having a heart attack wait approximately 37 minutes longer than men before contacting medical services. Researchers performed the retrospective analysis on 4,360 patients \u2014 20 percent of whom were women \u2014 treated at Triemli Hospital in Switzerland from 2000 to 2016. (The study did not find that the delay was associated with higher rates of death.)\n\nOne of the reasons women wait longer to call for help is that they don\u2019t know that heart attack symptoms for women are sometimes different from men\u2019s, according to the study\u2019s author and experts interviewed by HuffPost after its release.\n\n\u201cMen often get crushing chest pain. It\u2019s kind of clear. They\u2019ll call for help or go to the ER,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital who works with the American Heart Association\u2019s Go Red for Women initiative. It\u2019s possible for women to experience the classic chest-clutching, arm-numbing signs of heart attack, but sometimes they\u2019re far less obvious. \u201cWomen\u2019s symptoms could be more subtle, like shortness of breath or jaw pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, even flu-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nSigns can also include throat, neck, chest, stomach or shoulder pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes and cold sweat, dizziness and weakness.\n\n\u201cThe subtleties of these symptoms sometimes lead women to believe maybe they will feel better soon or it\u2019s going to pass, and they don\u2019t reach out for help,\u201d Steinbaum added.\n\nGoldberg said women might hesitate because they\u2019re worried about looking silly if they show up at the hospital and aren\u2019t having a heart attack. But she and Steinbaum agree that the risk is far too high to ignore the symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe head of my fellowship program used to say, \u2018Remember, time is muscle,\u2019\u201d Steinbaum said. \u201cThe longer you wait, the higher the chance of damaging a bigger part of your heart, and if that happens, the greater chance of really becoming quite sick with heart failure or death.\u201d\n\nThe subtleties of these symptoms sometimes lead women to believe maybe they will feel better soon or it\u2019s going to pass, and they don\u2019t reach out for help.\" Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine\n\nDespite the fact that heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, heart disease has been historically perceived as a man\u2019s disease and has been studied and treated as such.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that women don\u2019t have heart attacks,\u201d said Goldberg. It\u2019s that they differ in women, presenting differently and often later in life. \u201cThe most common time for [women] to have them is about 10 years after menopause, whereas in men, the prime time to have a heart attack is their 40s and 50s.\u201d\n\nHeart attack rates are rising among people ages 35 to 54 \u2015 and those rates are rising faster among women.\n\nAbout 80 percent of cardiovascular disease can be prevented. That is why it\u2019s important to raise awareness about heart disease in women, its prevalence and how it differs from heart disease in men \u2014 not just among patients but among members of the medical and research community as well, where women\u2019s needs aren\u2019t getting the attention they should.\n\nA Women\u2019s Disease Too\n\nDuring her residency, Goldberg once heard a doctor say women don\u2019t get heart disease. Then in 1990 a female patient came in with what she suspected were symptoms of a heart attack. While other doctors told the patient she was likely just stressed, Goldberg wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\nAfter a stress test came back abnormal, she persuaded the patient\u2019s doctors to do further cardiac testing. The patient was found to have a 99 percent blockage in a major heart artery \u2015 on the precipice one of the deadliest types of heart attacks there is.\n\nGoldberg said a lot of advances have been made since then but more has to be done to dispel the myth that heart disease affects mostly men.\n\nGender disparities in diagnosis and treatment are still considered a significant issue. A study published by the American Heart Association in February found that when women sought medical care for heart attack symptoms, 53 percent of the time, their health care providers did not believe their symptoms were health related. That\u2019s compared with 37 percent of men who were told the same thing.\n\nIn August a report from Stony Brook University in New York found that women having a heart attack waited 20 percent longer than men did from the moment they arrived at the hospital to when they began to receive care. That month another study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, showed that women are more likely to survive a heart attack if their cardiologist is a woman.\n\nZinkevych via Getty Images Heart attack symptoms in women can include throat, neck, chest, stomach or shoulder pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s become important to understand there are studies that have shown that doctors have really not been as proactive about taking care of their women patients compared to their male patients when it comes to heart disease \u2015 whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re not as aware or perhaps because there is an unconscious gender bias to it,\u201d Steinbaum said.\n\n\u201cI would like to believe in the medical world, [bias] doesn\u2019t exist, but the problem is we are all human beings,\u201d she added.\n\nPart of the problem, Goldberg said, is a lack of female cardiologists, who have thus far led the way when it comes to researching and raising awareness of heart disease in women.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the movement on cardiovascular disease in women has been led by women who are cardiologists,\u201d she said. But \u201cwe make up only 12.5 percent of the board-certified cardiologists in our country. And I think our male colleagues have to also get involved.\u201d\n\nGiving women the knowledge and language to communicate their symptoms is an important way to overcome possible bias, Goldberg and Steinbaum stressed.\n\n\u201cWomen themselves, they\u2019re not educated about the symptoms. They\u2019re not really good advocates for themselves to even go and say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure, but I might be having a heart issue,\u2019\u201d Steinbaum said. \u201cI think personal advocacy becomes a very, very important part of this.\u201d\n\nThe Knowledge Gap\n\nSteinbaum said the conversation around heart disease began to shift in 1984, when more women began dying of the disease than men.\n\nBefore then, \u201call heart disease research was done on men,\u201d she added. \u201cWomen were just not part of those trials and certainly not part of the major preventive trials. So we\u2019ve gone from not having women in trials to now beginning to study women\u2019s hearts and realizing there is a fundamental difference [between women and men], and we are learning.\u201d\n\nFor instance, it is known that conditions such as diabetes, lack of exercise and cigarette smoking increase both men\u2019s and women\u2019s risk for heart attack. But research has revealed that there are others conditions, including gestational diabetes and autoimmune disease, that can increase the risk of heart disease specifically for women, according to Goldberg.\n\n\u201cA lot of the movement on cardiovascular disease in women has been led by women who are cardiologists. ... I think our male colleagues have to also get involved.\u201d Dr. Nieca Goldber, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine\n\nBoth cardiologists said to learn more about the unique issues in heart disease among women, more research must be done regarding prevention, risk factors, and treatment. Steinbaum said this includes having women represented in clinical trials for pharmaceuticals and devices that are used in treatment and surgery. \u201cWomen\u2019s participation in research studies is only about 20 percent,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nIt\u2019s especially low among black women, who are disproportionately affected by strokes. Almost 50 percent of African-American women ages 20 or older have some form of cardiovascular disease. But Steinbaum said they get less care and are less likely to be involved in clinical trials than white women.\n\n\u201cUnless we have women represented in clinical trials, we won\u2019t have enough information about treatment and diagnosis for women in heart disease,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nNeither she or Steinbaum knows why so few participate in clinical trials, but they hypothesize that at least part of it is that many women are still the primary caretakers for their families and are too busy juggling work, children and more to participate in trials that are time-consuming.\n\n\u201cWe have to make research easier for potential individuals to engage in and give them a better understanding about participation in research and how it will drive important changes in health care in women,\u201d Goldberg said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Blue Scorpion Venom Is Popular Pain Medicine In Cuba", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blue-scorpion-venom-pain-meds_us_5c1421eae4b009b8aea7466e", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "(Reuters) - Once a month for the last decade, Pepe Casanas, a 78-year-old Cuban farmer, has hunted down a scorpion to sting himself with, vowing that the venom wards off his rheumatism pains.\n\nHis natural remedy is no longer seen as very unusual here. Researchers in Cuba have found that the venom of the blue scorpion, whose scientific name is Rhopalurus junceus, endemic to the Caribbean island, appears to have anti-inflammatory and pain relief properties, and may be able to delay tumor growth in some cancer patients.\n\nWhile some oncologists abroad say more research is needed to be able to properly back up such a claim, Cuban pharmaceutical firm Labiofam has been using scorpion venom since 2011 to manufacture the homeopathic medicine Vidatox.\n\nThe remedy has proven popular. Labiofam Business Director Carlos Alberto Delgado told Reuters sales were climbing 10 percent annually. Vidatox already sells in around 15 countries worldwide and is currently in talks with China to sell the remedy there.\n\nIn Cuba, where tens of thousands of patients have been treated with Vidatox, each vial costs under a dollar. On the black market abroad it can cost hundred times that - retailers on Amazon.com are seen selling them for up to $140.\n\n\u201cI put the scorpion where I feel pain,\u201d Casanas said while demonstrating his homemade pain relief with a scorpion that he found under a pile of debris on the patch of land he cultivates in Cuba\u2019s western province of Pinar del Rio.\n\nAfter squeezing it long enough, it stung him and he winced.\n\n\u201cIt hurts for a while, but then it calms and goes and I don\u2019t have any more pain,\u201d he said.\n\nCasanas, a leathery-skinned former tobacco farmer who now primarily grows beans for his own consumption, said he sometimes keeps a scorpion under his straw hat like a lucky charm. It likes the shade and humidity, he says, so just curls up and sleeps.\n\nFROM FARM TO LAB\n\nIn a Labiofam laboratory in the southern Cuban city of Cienfuegos, workers dressed in scrubs and hairnets tend to nearly 6,000 scorpions housed in plastic containers lined up on rows of metal racks.\n\nEvery few days they feed and water the arachnids that sit on a bed of small stones. Once a month, they apply an 18V electrical jolt to their tails using a handcrafted machine in order to trigger the release of a few drops of venom.\n\nThe venom is then diluted with distilled water and shaken vigorously, which homeopathic practitioners believe activates its \u201cvital energy.\u201d\n\nThe scorpions are caught in the wild as Labiofam workers believe their venom - which is not dangerous - is not as potent when raised in captivity.\n\nAfter two years of exploitation in the \u201cescorpionario,\u201d they are released back into the wild.\n\nDr. Fabio Linares, the head of Labiofam\u2019s homeopathic medicine laboratory who developed the medicine, said Vidatox stimulates the body\u2019s natural defense mechanisms.\n\n\u201cAfter four to five years (of taking it), the doctor whose care I was in told me that my cancer hadn\u2019t advanced,\u201d said Cuban patient Jose Manuel Alvarez Acosta, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "These Women Posed 'Nude' In The Middle Of London To Make A Point About Victoria's Secret", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nude-victorias-secret_us_5c118494e4b002a46c13e1bd", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Goodbye, angels; hello, absolute badasses.\n\nJust days after the hotly debated Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show paraded its historically narrow-minded ideals of beauty down the runway for yet another year, seven women stripped down to their underwear to show the brand \u2015 and the world \u2015 what true diversity looks like.\n\nThey staged their protest outside a Victoria\u2019s Secret store in London\u2019s bustling Oxford Circus.\n\nJordan Smith\n\nJordan Smith\n\nThe idea was conceptualized by Joanne Morales and Sylvia Mac. Morales is the founder of Nunude, a U.K.-based lingerie, clothing and swimwear brand that boasts a wide range of nude garments to accommodate different skin tones and sizes. Mac is a child burn survivor who created her website Love Disfigure when she felt people with scars and skin conditions were not being properly represented in mainstream media and pop culture, and as a way to embrace her own body and inspire others to follow suit.\n\nMac and Morales called on their communities of followers and customers to participate in what they agreed was not an angry protest but rather a way to celebrate diversity. Their shared mission was to provide an example of what it\u2019s like be size inclusive but to also be inclusive of race, ability and both visible and invisible illness.\n\n\u201cWe were fed up seeing these so-called perfect body images online, with there being just one perceived beautiful body type,\u201d Mac told HuffPost.\n\nMorales, who launched Nunude in 2017 simply as an underwear brand catering to all sizes and skin tones, told HuffPost it has since evolved and reconsidered what its idea of diversity really is and its role in pushing that idea forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an underwear company providing skin tone underwear for women with the idea of loving yourself completely bare the way you are,\u201d she said.\n\nThat shared idea to change the scope of not only the fashion industry but the way women and people feel about their bodies drove them to plan the widely shared protest. Morales, Mac and five other women of different skin tones and sizes, some who are burn survivors, some with invisible disabilities, stood as one powerful unit in front of the Victoria\u2019s Secret store last week. They are pictured proudly posing in just bras and underwear.\n\nThe spectacle drew crowds of onlookers, who offered largely positive feedback. The supportive attention made it clear to Morales why what they\u2019re doing is so important.\n\n\u201cWe talked to little kids, older women, all different people of all different backgrounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were saying \u2018thank you so much,\u2019 they were crying. It\u2019s deeper for us, it\u2019s about making women feel beautiful. Especially as a brand owner, we are responsible for making women feel beautiful. If we\u2019re going to cater to their size, we should represent them.\u201d\n\nJordan Smith Passersby approached the protesters with questions and grateful tears.\n\nJordan Smith\n\nOf course, Victoria\u2019s Secret famously does not cater to all sizes, and the company\u2019s leadership has made clear its position on including both plus-size and transgender models on its runway. But brands like Nunude, which exclusively use fans and customers as models and believe in making room for all people to be included and represented in fashion, are the ones who will end up leading the charge for change.\n\nAs for the experience itself, Morales and Mac said the group was nervous beforehand \u2015 not just because they were planning to stand in the middle of a busy street in their underwear but also because of where they chose to get into said underwear.\n\n\u201cWe stripped inside the store,\u201d Morales said. \u201cIt was really nerve-wracking. We thought we would get chucked out. When we didn\u2019t, we were just walking around the store in our nude underwear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we went out of the store and turned around to see people filming us and coming to talk to us, it was a truly amazing day,\u201d Mac added.\n\nThere has, of course, been some negativity thrown their way, as is the case with almost everything on the internet. But Mac and Morales choose to focus on the positive and stress the importance of not judging a book by its cover.\n\n\u201cWhat some of the girls have been through, it\u2019s so admirable for them to get out there for all women,\u201d Morales said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to show that no matter what you go through, your visible and invisible scars, you shouldn\u2019t be judged.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Johnson & Johnson Knew About Asbestos In Baby Powder, Didn't Report To FDA", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/johnson-and-johnson-baby-powder-asbestos_us_5c13bfc5e4b0f60cfa286b07", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.\n\nShe knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.\n\nCoker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? \u201cShe wanted answers,\u201d her daughter Cady Evans said.\n\nFighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that \u201cpoisonous talc\u201d in the company\u2019s beloved product was her killer.\n\nJ&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.\n\nCoker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. \u201cWhen you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nThat was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company\u2019s talc caused their cancers \u2014 including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.\n\nA Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.\n\nThe documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators\u2019 plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.\n\nA small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.\n\n\u201cRATHER HIGH\u201d\n\nThe earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J\u2019s Italian supplier as fibrous and \u201cacicular,\u201d or needle-like, tremolite. That\u2019s one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.\n\nAt various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J\u2019s supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as \u201cfiberform\u201d and \u201crods.\u201d\n\nIn 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was \u201cdetected in any sample\u201d of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn\u2019t tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc \u2013 in one case at levels reported as \u201crather high.\u201d\n\nMost internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J\u2019s testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected \u2013 and only a tiny fraction of the company\u2019s talc is tested.\n\nThe World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years\n\nlater. Just how small hasn\u2019t been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.\n\nThe evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they\n\nbegan demanding J&J\u2019s testing documentation.\n\nWhat J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn\u2019t necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and\n\nother cancers, has had mixed success in court.\n\nIn two cases earlier this year \u2013 in New Jersey and California \u2013 juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.\n\nA third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J\u2019s potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.\n\nAt the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs\u2019 mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.\n\n\u201cJUNK\u201d SCIENCE\n\nJ&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, \u201cjunk\u201d science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,\u201d Ernie Knewitz, J&J\u2019s vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters\u2019 findings. \u201cThis is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.\u201d\n\nJ&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.\n\nThe company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters\u2019 findings as \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d \u201cThe scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,\u201d Bicks wrote. \u201cThis is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson\u2019s cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos.\u201d He dismissed tests cited in this article as \u201coutlier\u201d results.\n\nIn court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up \u201cbackground\u201d asbestos \u2013 stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.\n\nThe company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades \u2013 in bottles from plaintiffs\u2019 cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J\u2019s corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users \u201cwould have, more likely than not, been exposed,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.\n\nMatthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: \u201cI have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,\u201d Sanchez told the jury. Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.\n\nSince 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys SA, a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Both companies said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the Paris-based company\u2019s tests \u201cconsistently show no asbestos. Talc\u2019s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.\u201d\n\nJ&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J\u2019s $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker\u2019s carefully tended image as a caring company \u2013 a \u201csacred cow,\u201d as one 2003 internal email put it.\n\n\u201cWhen people really understand what\u2019s going on, I think it increases J&J\u2019s exposure a thousand-fold,\u201d said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.\n\nThe mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn\u2019t shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company\u2019s Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had \u201cstrong grounds on appeal.\u201d\n\nJ&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: \u201cWe remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.\u201d\n\nGorsky\u2019s comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure \u2013 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.\n\n\u201cSAFETY FIRST\u201d\n\nIn 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the \u201cSafety First\u201d motto. Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.\n\nSoon, mothers began applying the talc to infants\u2019 diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\n\nIn the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That\u2019s one of six minerals \u2013 along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite \u2013 that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable \u201cnon-asbestiform\u201d rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.\n\nJ&J\u2019s worry at the time was that contaminants made the company\u2019s powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much \u201cgrit\u201d as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained \u201cfrom less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,\u201d described as mostly fibrous and \u201cacicular\u201d tremolite.\n\nMost of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company\u2019s talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was \u201ccleavage fragments\u201d from non-asbestiform tremolite.\n\nJ&J\u2019s original records don\u2019t always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, \u201cmakes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,\u201d agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.\n\nAnd as the product safety director for J&J\u2019s talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: \u201c(I)f a deposit contains \u2018non-asbestiform\u2019 tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHE LUNGS OF BABIES\u201d\n\nIn 1964, J&J\u2019s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.\n\nTen years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J\u2019s talc supply for decades.\n\nJ&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was \u201cnormal\u201d to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. \u201cHistorically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,\u201d Ashton wrote. \u201cHow bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?\u201d\n\nSince pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, \u201cit would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite \u2026 to an absolute minimum,\u201d came the reply from another physician executive days later.\n\nThe doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder\u2019s son and then-retired CEO, had expressed \u201cconcern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe have replied,\u201d the doctor wrote, that \u201cwe would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard.\u201d Such assurances would be impossible, he added, \u201cif we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.\u201d\n\nThe memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because \u201cit is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.\u201d\n\nNEVER \u201c100% CLEAN\u201d\n\nBy the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.\n\nRegulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon\u2019s newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.\n\nBy then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.\n\nThey shared their preliminary findings with New York City\u2019s environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.\n\nThe FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: \u201cOur fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.\u201d\n\nLater that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a \u201crelatively small\u201d amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.\n\nLanger, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of \u201cantagonistic personalities\u201d in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an \u201cattack on talc.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose I was antagonistic,\u201d Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn\u2019t find asbestos \u2013 a result that Mount Sinai announced.\n\nLanger said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.\n\nSelikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018How come it took so long?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nIn July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared \u201cevidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.\u201d\n\nLater that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company\u2019s public relations department that J&J\u2019s talc contained trace amounts of \u201cfibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).\u201d\n\n\u201cINCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS\u201d\n\nAs the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount \u201cinsignificant\u201d and the samples \u201csubstantially free of asbestiform material.\u201d J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the \u201cresults clearly show\u201d the samples tested \u201ccontain no chrysotile asbestos.\u201d J&J\u2019s lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.\n\nBut J&J\u2019s FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson\u2019s finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample \u2013 \u201cincontrovertible asbestos,\u201d as he described it in a lab note.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: \u201cI understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.\u201d\n\nBy 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J\u2019s Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.\n\n\u201cIt is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,\u201d Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the \u201cprocess may well be valuable property to us.\u201d\n\nAt the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: \u201cWe will want to carefully consider the \u2026 patents re asbestos in talc. It\u2019s quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.\u201d\n\nJ&J did not obtain the patents.\n\nWhile Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company\u2019s Vermont mining operation. \u201cOccasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,\u201d he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. \u201cAnd these might be classified as asbestos fiber.\u201d\n\nJ&J should \u201cprotect our powder franchise\u201d by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that \u201cno final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles.\u201d Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, \u201cis obviously another answer.\u201d\n\nBicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.\n\nCornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative \u201cfor defensive reasons\u201d because \u201cthe thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS\u201d\n\nA few months after Petterson\u2019s recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency\u2019s cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.\n\nAt the time, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for \u201can automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos.\u201d That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA\u2019s proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.\n\nThe same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, \u201cwe may have problems.\u201d\n\nThe best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company\u2019s own researchers had earlier used to identify a \u201ctremolite-type\u201d asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: \u201cIt may be too sensitive.\u201d\n\nIn his email to Reuters, J&J\u2019s lawyer said the lab supervisor\u2019s concern was that the test would result in \u201cfalse positives,\u201d showing asbestos where there was none.\n\nJ&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA\u2019s new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.\n\n\u201cIt was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,\u201d the minutes state.\n\nIn a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since \u201ca substantial safety factor can be expected\u201d with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, \u201cmethods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.\u201d\n\nNot everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it \u201cfoolish,\u201d adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: \u201cNo mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.\u201d\n\nPUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION\n\nHaving failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.\n\n\u201cThe attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,\u201d the cover letter said. \u201cWe are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.\u201d\n\nIn its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected \u201cin any sample.\u201d\n\nJ&J didn\u2019t tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J \u2013 \u201cfiberform\u201d actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as \u201casbestos fibers\u201d in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. \u201cSome of them seem rather high,\u201d the private lab wrote in its cover letter.\n\nBicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab\u2019s results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found \u201cwas not asbestiform,\u201d based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.\n\nJust two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, \u201cfibrous anthophyllite\u201d and other types of asbestos had been \u201cfound in association with the Hammondsville ore body\u201d \u2013 the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.\n\nZeitz\u2019s May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc \u201cstrongly urged\u201d the adoption of ways to protect \u201cagainst what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.\u201d\n\nBicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.\n\nThe following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, \u201cit can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION\u201d\n\nJ&J\u2019s selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge\u2019s decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. \u201cProviding the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,\u201d Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.\n\n\u201cJ&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge\u2019s comments,\u201d Bicks said. \u201cJ&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.\u201d\n\nThe FDA declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nLacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.\n\nInstead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.\n\nThe CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.\n\nX-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J\u2019s lawyer said the company\u2019s tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J\u2019s X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.\n\nBut the company never adopted the Colorado lab\u2019s 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn\u2019t guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.\n\nAs early as 1976, Ashton, J&J\u2019s longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, \u201cwill be hard pressed in supporting purity claims.\u201d He described this sort of testing as both \u201csophisticated\u201d and \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFREE OF HAZARD\u201d\n\nBy 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J\u2019s \u201cDefense of Talc Safety\u201d campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be \u201cfree of hazard.\u201d It attributed \u201cthis growing opinion\u201d to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of \u201cfavorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.\u201d\n\nIn 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency\u2019s investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. \u201cSo in subsequent analyzes,\u201d he told the paper, \u201cwe really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.\n\nIn 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder \u2013 to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.\n\nThe persistence of the industry\u2019s view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It\u2019s also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don\u2019t apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc \u2013 even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.\n\nUntil recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry\u2019s position, saying on its website: \u201cAll talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry\u2019s standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States \u201cshould be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.\u201d\n\nThe revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as \u201ccarcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\nDespite the success of J&J\u2019s efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company\u2019s test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: \u201cThe samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.\u201d\n\nThen, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on \u201cimportant environmental issues\u201d in its talc reserves that there was \u201cpast tremolite\u201d in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.\n\nBicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, \u201cwere destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.\u201d\n\nBicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded \u2013 a finding deemed \u201cBDL\u201d \u2013 below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as \u201cbackground asbestos\u201d that did not come from any talc source.\n\nIn 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. \u201cI recognize the concern,\u201d he told Reuters. He said the agency\u2019s policing of cosmetics in general \u2013 fewer than 30 people regulating a \u201cvast\u201d industry \u2013 was \u201ca place where we think we can be doing more.\u201d\n\nGottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to \u201clook at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk.\u201d An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining \u201cscientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.\u201d\n\n\u201cFISHING EXPEDITION\u201d\n\nBefore law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn\u2019t exceed OSHA limits.\n\nThat\u2019s why he zeroed in on Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.\n\nHobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.\n\nJ&J objected. Hobson\u2019s \u201cfishing expedition\u201d would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson\u2019s request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company\u2019s Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite \u201casbestos\u201d needles.\n\nHobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker\u2019s lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had \u201cno evidence\u201d Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.\n\nTen days later, the pathology report landed: Coker\u2019s lung tissue contained tens of thousands of \u201clong fibers\u201d of four different types of asbestos. The findings were \u201cconsistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\u201cThe asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,\u201d Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J\u2019s dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.\n\nWithout evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.\n\nHobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: \u201cThey knew what the problems were, and they hid it.\u201d J&J\u2019s records would have made a \u201c100% difference\u201d in Coker\u2019s case.\n\nHad the information about asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc come out earlier, he said, \u201cmaybe there would have been 20 years less exposure\u201d for other people.\n\nBicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because \u201cthe discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff\u2019s disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.\u201d\n\nCoker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.\n\nCoker\u2019s daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.\n\n\u201cWhen Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,\u201d Deckard said. \u201cI have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "One Of Her Classmates Died By Suicide. Then Another.

They were about to be high school freshmen, and the group was buzzing with anticipation. Then, days before classes started, Hoston killed himself.\n\n\u201cHis mom found him in the basement,\u201d says 18-year-old Bella Price, one of his good friends and a classmate. \u201cIt was a big shock.\u201d\n\nHoston was popular and smart, according to people in Spring Hill, a tiny town of about 5,000 in Johnson County. He played football and basketball and even set a middle school record running track. He had a loving family. His friends couldn\u2019t make sense of what happened, says Price.\n\nThe next summer, another member of Price\u2019s class at Spring Hill High also died by suicide. This second death shattered the community.\n\nOver the last two decades, the suicide rate in America has risen 33 percent, according to statistics released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The country\u2019s life expectancy has declined over the last several years, and suicides are the biggest culprit, after drug overdoses. Among young people specifically, suicide is a leading cause of death.\n\nJohnson County \u2014 a predominantly white, affluent set of suburbs near Kansas City \u2014 saw itself as one of the most desirable places to live in the sprawling metropolitan area. So suicide was not a topic people here were prepared to confront. Since 2017, at least 14 students have taken their own lives, compared with five student suicides in the previous two years. Each new death brought a fresh wave of helplessness and isolation.\n\nIn response, the community is coming together to pull back the curtain on the uncomfortable topic of teen suicide and address it directly.\n\nLast spring, superintendents across the county\u2019s six school districts formed a coalition to make suicide prevention a top priority in schools. Over the next few months, the group met with mental health professionals, law enforcement, hospitals and faith leaders to come up with a plan to train students, teachers and parents to identify a young person in need and how to get them help.\n\n\u201cWe decided we need to come out and publicly talk about this,\u201d said Todd White, superintendent of the Blue Valley School District, where five students died by suicide between the spring of 2017 and spring of 2018. \u201cWe need to stop making suicide a subject that\u2019s taboo and let the kids help us figure out what to do.\u201d\n\nIt was White who first convened the superintendents. Their effort has since expanded beyond school walls, touching many aspects of life in the county. Though it\u2019s too soon to tell how effective it\u2019s been, the CDC says many suicides can be prevented if more people understand the warning signs and ways to intervene.\n\nDr. John Ackerman, suicide prevention coordinator at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, says communities need to talk openly about suicide. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be pulling drowning kids out of a river. We want to make sure they\u2019re not jumping into the rapids in the first place,\u201d he says.\n\nHere are stories from some of those whose lives have been touched by teen suicide and who have engaged in the effort to prevent more deaths.\n\nThe Student\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost Price shows her phone screensaver, which features a photo of her and some friends, including Hoston.\n\nThe screensaver on Bella Price\u2019s phone features a photo of her friends, a grinning bunch crowded together on her family\u2019s basement steps. Bella\u2019s at the top, her red wavy hair tumbling down over her shoulders. Josh Hoston is right next to her with a mile-wide smile and his muscular athlete\u2019s arms folded across his knees.\n\nThree years after his death, Price and her friends are still grappling with the loss. The suicide of another classmate, Tai\u2019Shaughn Mathews, would eventually push Price to action. This fall, she became part of the \u201cteen council,\u201d a group of students from the six school districts in Johnson County who have come together to see how they can work to prevent any more of their friends and classmates from taking their own lives.\n\nThey\u2019re learning how to identify trusted adults and encouraging kids to tell someone when they\u2019re worried about a friend or classmate. They\u2019re studying warning signs from peers and working on a prevention campaign dubbed #zeroreasonswhy to change perceptions and behaviors associated with suicide.\n\n\u201cI want to be someone that people feel comfortable bringing their problems to, that someone felt that they could go to if they ever felt like there was no other way out,\u201d Price says.\n\n\u201cEveryone wishes that they could have reassured Josh that like, \u2018Hey, you could have come to me and I would have helped you with anything, no matter what.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Family\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost Nathan and Sylvia Harrell lost their 17-year-old son, Chad, to suicide. A favorite photo (right) shows Chad as a 2-year-old being comforted by his older sister, Melanie.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Chad Harrell was angry his parents wouldn\u2019t let him go to a party on a Sunday night in June last year. The Friday before, they\u2019d found out he\u2019d been drinking and driving. His parents, Sylvia and Nathan, said they weren\u2019t grounding him, but they thought it was not appropriate he go to a party just two days later. Besides, they\u2019d planned a family night with his big sister.\n\nChad stuck around but when he was disengaged and silent, his dad sent him to his room.\n\nLater that night, his parents stopped by his room to say goodnight. He still seemed steamed. They told him they loved him and went to bed.\n\nKnowing Chad was upset, his mother opened his door to check on him just after midnight. Chad had killed himself.\n\n\u201cAnd that was the moment this unending nightmare began,\u201d Sylvia said.\n\nBoth parents said they were completely broadsided by Chad\u2019s choice.\n\n\u201cWe were the closest family I know,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take drugs. He wasn\u2019t a substance abuser. He was a fun-loving kid with a great sense of humor and great friends.\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019re reaching for any possible insights that might explain the loss.\n\n\u201cChad\u2019s personality from the time he was 2 was independent,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cHe\u2019d always say \u2018I do it, I do it,\u2019 if it was holding his hand while we crossed the street or putting butter on his bread.\u201d\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost The Harrells created a foundation called Keep the Spark Alive after losing their 17-year-old son, Chad (pictured), to suicide.\n\nThe suicide haunts Chad\u2019s 20-year-old sister, Melanie, too. They were best friends. She was in her room across the hall when he took his life. He\u2019d sometimes mention to her that he felt sad but didn\u2019t know why, that he had everything he wanted.\n\n\u201cI hate the idea he was right across the hall in his room and struggling so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be there in a heartbeat anytime he needed me, and that he felt so alone and couldn\u2019t reach out is hard.\u201d\n\nThe family has gone over and over how they might have missed any warning signs.\n\n\u201cAll his friends came over the next day,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cI asked them what they thought God was saying to Chad. Was he saying, \u2018Chad, good job! Way to go!\u2019 They were crying and shaking their heads. They knew he\u2019d made just one final, irreversible bad choice.\u201d\n\nFriends created a GoFundMe account that raised $90,000 after Chad\u2019s death. The family sponsored a golf tournament and raised another $150,000 to fund a new curriculum for students in elementary, middle and high school. It\u2019s designed to encourage kids to talk about their own sadness, depression or anxiety. For the older students, programs will start this winter to reduce stigma around mental health and engage parents and school staff as partners in suicide prevention. The Harrells have created a foundation called Keep the Spark Alive, after Chad\u2019s nickname. The family is in the early stages of collaborating with other efforts across Johnson County targeting the teen suicide epidemic.\n\n\u201cFrom the minute we lost Chad, we said the only way we\u2019re really going to get through this is to try and make a difference,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cTo give these young people the tools to help each other reach out when suicide seems like the only option.\u201d\n\nThe Pastor\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost Adam Hamilton is pastor of United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in the Johnson County suburb of Leawood. Hamilton says he'\u0080\u0099s done 32 funerals for young and older people who'\u0080\u0099ve taken their own lives in the last two years.\n\nWhen school superintendents in Johnson County were discussing how to address the rising number of teen suicides, one of the first people they contacted was Pastor Adam Hamilton of United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in the town of Leawood.\n\nHamilton is nationally recognized as a pot-stirrer among his largely Republican flock, unafraid to tackle thorny issues like poverty or suicide.\n\nHamilton says he\u2019s conducted 32 funerals for young and older people who\u2019ve taken their lives in the past two years. That\u2019s more than he did over his last two decades at the church.\n\n\u201cOne thing you recognize when you\u2019re doing a funeral for a teenager,\u201d he said, \u201cis there are a whole lot of other teenagers there who\u2019ve also walked through dark circumstances and the likelihood they will see suicide as an option has increased dramatically. So we have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nAt a time when young people are said to be leaving the church, the charismatic pastor has been able to attract thousands of youth at four campuses across the Kansas City metro area.\n\nHe talks to them about reading the suicide note his grandmother left when his mother was just 16.\n\n\u201cI tell them she really felt she was doing them a service, relieving them of caring for her and her depression,\u201d he says. \u201cI tell them that the impact of her suicide is being felt by her family 60 years later.\u201d\n\nThe church has started education and awareness programs in the wake of the increase in teen suicides. It\u2019s held large and small meetups with counselors, mental health professionals and testimonials from survivors.\n\nHamilton hopes to switch the dialogue, to talk boldly and honestly about suicide to a generation accustomed to seeing an unvarnished version of life on social media.\n\n\u201cWe had a video of a man who\u2019d jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and talks about regretting it the moment he jumped,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not talking about this from a theological, spiritual and pastoral perspective, then we\u2019re missing out on a huge piece of the puzzle around the number of teen suicides.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

The majority\u2019s approach, he said from the bench, \u201camounts to a vast judicial overreaching.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling was the most significant federalism decision since the New Deal and the most closely watched case since Bush v. Gore in 2000. It was a crucial milestone for the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, allowing almost all \u2014 and perhaps, in the end, all \u2014 of its far-reaching changes to roll forward.\n\nMr. Obama welcomed the court\u2019s decision on the health care law, which has inspired fierce protests, legal challenges and vows of repeal since it was passed. \u201cWhatever the politics, today\u2019s decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives are more secure because of this law,\u201d he said at the White House.\n\nRepublicans, though, used the occasion to attack it again.\n\n\u201cObamacare was bad policy yesterday; it\u2019s bad policy today,\u201d Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in remarks near the Capitol. \u201cObamacare was bad law yesterday; it\u2019s bad law today.\u201d He, like Congressional Republicans, renewed his pledge to undo the law.\n\nThe historic decision, coming after three days of lively oral arguments in March and in the midst of a presidential campaign, drew intense attention across the nation. Outside the court, more than 1,000 people gathered \u2014 packing the sidewalk, playing music , chanting slogans \u2014 and a loud cheer went up as word spread that the law had been largely upheld. Chants of \u201cYes we can!\u201d rang out, but the ruling also provoked disappointment among Tea Party supporters.\n\nIn Loudoun County, Va., Angela Laws, 58, the owner of a cleaning service, said she and her fianc\u00e9 were relieved at the news. \u201cWe laughed, and we shouted with joy and hugged each other,\u201d she said, explaining that she had been unable to get insurance because of her diabetes and back problems until a provision in the health care law went into effect.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty about the law\u2019s fate, the court\u2019s ruling provides some clarity \u2014 and perhaps an alert \u2014 to states, insurers, employers and consumers about what they are required to do by 2014, when much of the law comes into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Obama administration had argued that the mandate was necessary because it allowed other provisions of the law to function: those overhauling the way insurance is sold and those preventing sick people from being denied or charged extra for insurance. The mandate\u2019s supporters had said it was necessary to ensure that not only sick people but also healthy individuals would sign up for coverage, keeping insurance premiums more affordable.\n\nConservatives took comfort from two parts of the decision: the new limits it placed on federal regulation of commerce and on the conditions the federal government may impose on money it gives the states.\n\nFive justices accepted the argument that had been at the heart of the challenges brought by 26 states and other plaintiffs: that the federal government is not permitted to force individuals not engaged in commercial activities to buy services they do not want. That was a stunning victory for a theory pressed by a small band of conservative and libertarian lawyers.

Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , dissented on this point, calling the view \u201cstunningly retrogressive.\u201d She wondered why Chief Justice Roberts had seen fit to address it at all in light of his vote to uphold the mandate under the tax power.\n\nAkhil Reed Amar, a Yale law professor and a champion of the health care law, said that it was \u201cimportant to look at the dark cloud behind the silver lining.\u201d\n\n\u201cFederal power has more restrictions on it,\u201d he said, referring to the new limits on regulating commerce. \u201cGoing forward, there may even be laws on the books that have to be re-examined.\u201d\n\nThe restrictions placed on the Medicaid expansion may also have significant ripple effects. A splintered group of justices effectively revised the law to allow states to choose between participating in the expansion while receiving additional payments or forgoing the expansion and retaining the existing payments. The law had called for an all-or-nothing choice.\n\nThe expansion had been designed to provide coverage to 17 million Americans. While some states have indicated that they will participate in the expansion, others may be resistant, leaving more people outside the safety net than the Obama administration had intended.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the decision did not turn on it, the back-and-forth between Justice Ginsburg\u2019s opinion for the four liberals and the joint opinion by the four conservatives \u2014 Justice Kennedy and Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 revisited the by-now-familiar arguments. Broccoli made a dozen appearances.\n\n\u201cAlthough an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so,\u201d Justice Ginsburg wrote. \u201cAnd if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.\u201d\n\nThe conservative dissenters responded that \u201cone day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer -fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health care costs that are a burden on the rest of us.\u201d\n\nAll of the justices agreed that their review of the health care law was not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, which allows suits over some sorts of taxes only after they become due. That could have delayed the health care challenge to 2015. The conservative dissenters said that the majority could not have it both ways by calling the mandate a tax for some purposes but not others.\n\n\u201cThat carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of sophists,\u201d they said.\n\nAs a general matter, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the decision in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393, offered no endorsement of the law\u2019s wisdom.\n\nSome decisions, the chief justice said, \u201care entrusted to our nation\u2019s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg, speaking to a crowded courtroom that sat rapt for the better part of an hour, drew a different conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act survives largely unscathed.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Names Mick Mulvaney Acting Chief of Staff", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-chief-of-staff.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cWhat he did at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was destroy an agency and undermine its mission,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cHe seems to be a Trump surrogate with a clear agenda, and my fear is he will exacerbate divisions at a time when they need to be bridged.\u201d\n\nLast year, Mr. Trump asked him to oversee the consumer bureau, an agency the president was bent on diminishing.

The majority\u2019s approach, he said from the bench, \u201camounts to a vast judicial overreaching.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling was the most significant federalism decision since the New Deal and the most closely watched case since Bush v. Gore in 2000. It was a crucial milestone for the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, allowing almost all \u2014 and perhaps, in the end, all \u2014 of its far-reaching changes to roll forward.\n\nMr. Obama welcomed the court\u2019s decision on the health care law, which has inspired fierce protests, legal challenges and vows of repeal since it was passed. \u201cWhatever the politics, today\u2019s decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives are more secure because of this law,\u201d he said at the White House.\n\nRepublicans, though, used the occasion to attack it again.\n\n\u201cObamacare was bad policy yesterday; it\u2019s bad policy today,\u201d Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in remarks near the Capitol. \u201cObamacare was bad law yesterday; it\u2019s bad law today.\u201d He, like Congressional Republicans, renewed his pledge to undo the law.\n\nThe historic decision, coming after three days of lively oral arguments in March and in the midst of a presidential campaign, drew intense attention across the nation. Outside the court, more than 1,000 people gathered \u2014 packing the sidewalk, playing music , chanting slogans \u2014 and a loud cheer went up as word spread that the law had been largely upheld. Chants of \u201cYes we can!\u201d rang out, but the ruling also provoked disappointment among Tea Party supporters.\n\nIn Loudoun County, Va., Angela Laws, 58, the owner of a cleaning service, said she and her fianc\u00e9 were relieved at the news. \u201cWe laughed, and we shouted with joy and hugged each other,\u201d she said, explaining that she had been unable to get insurance because of her diabetes and back problems until a provision in the health care law went into effect.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty about the law\u2019s fate, the court\u2019s ruling provides some clarity \u2014 and perhaps an alert \u2014 to states, insurers, employers and consumers about what they are required to do by 2014, when much of the law comes into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Obama administration had argued that the mandate was necessary because it allowed other provisions of the law to function: those overhauling the way insurance is sold and those preventing sick people from being denied or charged extra for insurance. The mandate\u2019s supporters had said it was necessary to ensure that not only sick people but also healthy individuals would sign up for coverage, keeping insurance premiums more affordable.\n\nConservatives took comfort from two parts of the decision: the new limits it placed on federal regulation of commerce and on the conditions the federal government may impose on money it gives the states.\n\nFive justices accepted the argument that had been at the heart of the challenges brought by 26 states and other plaintiffs: that the federal government is not permitted to force individuals not engaged in commercial activities to buy services they do not want. That was a stunning victory for a theory pressed by a small band of conservative and libertarian lawyers.

Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , dissented on this point, calling the view \u201cstunningly retrogressive.\u201d She wondered why Chief Justice Roberts had seen fit to address it at all in light of his vote to uphold the mandate under the tax power.\n\nAkhil Reed Amar, a Yale law professor and a champion of the health care law, said that it was \u201cimportant to look at the dark cloud behind the silver lining.\u201d\n\n\u201cFederal power has more restrictions on it,\u201d he said, referring to the new limits on regulating commerce. \u201cGoing forward, there may even be laws on the books that have to be re-examined.\u201d\n\nThe restrictions placed on the Medicaid expansion may also have significant ripple effects. A splintered group of justices effectively revised the law to allow states to choose between participating in the expansion while receiving additional payments or forgoing the expansion and retaining the existing payments. The law had called for an all-or-nothing choice.\n\nThe expansion had been designed to provide coverage to 17 million Americans. While some states have indicated that they will participate in the expansion, others may be resistant, leaving more people outside the safety net than the Obama administration had intended.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the decision did not turn on it, the back-and-forth between Justice Ginsburg\u2019s opinion for the four liberals and the joint opinion by the four conservatives \u2014 Justice Kennedy and Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 revisited the by-now-familiar arguments. Broccoli made a dozen appearances.\n\n\u201cAlthough an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so,\u201d Justice Ginsburg wrote. \u201cAnd if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.\u201d\n\nThe conservative dissenters responded that \u201cone day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer -fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health care costs that are a burden on the rest of us.\u201d\n\nAll of the justices agreed that their review of the health care law was not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, which allows suits over some sorts of taxes only after they become due. That could have delayed the health care challenge to 2015. The conservative dissenters said that the majority could not have it both ways by calling the mandate a tax for some purposes but not others.\n\n\u201cThat carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of sophists,\u201d they said.\n\nAs a general matter, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the decision in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393, offered no endorsement of the law\u2019s wisdom.\n\nSome decisions, the chief justice said, \u201care entrusted to our nation\u2019s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg, speaking to a crowded courtroom that sat rapt for the better part of an hour, drew a different conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act survives largely unscathed.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "title": "Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker Signs Bills Stripping Powers From Incoming Governor", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/wisconsin-governor-scott-walker.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Outside Mr. Walker\u2019s Capitol office, protesters marched and drummed and chanted fury at what they saw as an effort to weaken unions and diminish Democrats.

Paramount among them is personal chemistry with the president, who has made clear that he wants someone he personally likes for his third chief of staff.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first choice to replace Mr. Kelly, Nick Ayers, a Georgia political operative who is now Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, turned down an offer from the president over the weekend and plans to leave the administration. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who said publicly that he was interested in the job, was ruled out by the White House on Tuesday.\n\nFor Mr. Christie, who has two children in high school, the job would have been a personal sacrifice.\n\nMr. Christie has a memoir coming out next year, which is expected to touch on his tenure as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey. During that time, he prosecuted Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, a task that has since complicated his relationship with the Trump family."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/politics/politics-trump-cohen.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "From steps forward in the Trump hush-money investigation to tensions at the White House and on Capitol Hill, it\u2019s been a busy week in politics.

The tabloid played a crucial role in keeping the women silent ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThe revelations came on the same day that Michael D. Cohen, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump who directly implicated the president in the hush-money scandal during his sentencing, received three years in prison.\n\nMr. Trump reacted angrily to the relatively short prison sentence of Mr. Cohen, and in a series of Twitter posts on Thursday said that Mr. Cohen failed him as his lawyer because he should have known about campaign finance law. The president also said that he did not direct his lawyer to do anything illegal. In an interview with ABC News on Friday, Mr. Cohen said that \u201cof course\u201d the president knew the hush payments were wrong."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Texas Judge Strikes Down Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as Unconstitutional", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in Texas struck down the entire Affordable Care Act on Friday on the grounds that its mandate requiring people to buy health insurance is unconstitutional and the rest of the law cannot stand without it.\n\nThe ruling was over a lawsuit filed this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general. A group of intervening states led by Democrats promised to appeal the decision, which will most likely not have any immediate effect. But it will almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court, threatening the survival of the landmark health law and, with it, health coverage for millions of Americans, protections for people with pre-existing conditions and much more.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth said that the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance \u201ccan no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Judge O\u2019Connor, a George W.

The brain is continually adapting, or \u201crewiring,\u201d itself through life, particularly in utero and through adolescence, generating an ever-transforming genetic, cellular and genetic landscape that had defied the tools of modern science.\n\nA research team led by Nenad Sestan, another brain scientist at Yale, analyzed cells from tissue samples from 16 locations in the brains of dozens of people of all ages. The brains were collected post-mortem, and about half were from people who had been diagnosed with a disorder. The 16 brain regions correspond to areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, thought to be affected by problems like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nThe team tracked changes in the activity of genes and other molecular processes in those cells, looking for patterns that correlated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or autism. It identified a network of genes active in specific cell types \u2014 genes that were apparently communicating with one another \u2014 at about the stage in life when disorders begin to surface. Working backward, the researchers could trace the network pattern to specific cell types, biological activity and timing, as if reconstructing the how and when of a crime scene.\n\n\u201cHaving this insight will help us establish some potential causes and what they mean for neuropsychiatric disorders, and create new, testable hypotheses,\u201d Dr. Sestan said.\n\nThe result from all this work is a computer model for brain genomics that scientists can search \u2014 a database akin to Google Earth that charts specific genetic addresses in the brain and reveals which genetic and biological processes are active there, and at what point during maturation.\n\nDr. Matthew State, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author on two of the papers, said: \u201cEssentially what these papers do is lay out cellular and molecular landscape at a resolution that\u2019s never existed before. I see it as foundational work, and an investment that will pay off in giving us a far richer context to develop new hypotheses and study these disorders.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "In Battle Over Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, Asbestos Opens a New Legal Front", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/baby-powder-asbestos-johnson-johnson.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-15 09:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "Five years ago, Ms. Kim learned she had invasive ovarian cancer and was treated with chemotherapy.

One verdict, for $110 million, has been upheld by a judge; the company is appealing.\n\nBut asbestos, unlike talc, is an indisputable carcinogen. Even trace amounts are considered dangerous.
