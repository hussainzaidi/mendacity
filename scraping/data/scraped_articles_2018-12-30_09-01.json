In the emails, Kilimnik wrote to Manafort about an associate \"our friend V\" with ties to Deripaska, The Atlantic reported. According to Time, Boyarkin was the \"friend.\"\n\nFormer Russian intelligence officer Victor Boyarkin\n\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment to CNN on Time's report.\n\nThe alleged connection shows the leverage that powerful Russians had over Manafort at the time he was Trump's campaign chair between May and August of 2016, Time noted. Boyarkin also told Time that he has been approached by special counsel Robert Mueller's office, which is investigating ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia, but he told investigators \"to go dig a ditch.\"\n\nSpecial counsel spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment to Time.\n\nBoth Boyarkin and Deripaska, meanwhile, have been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department.\n\nIn its December 19 announcement of new Russia sanctions, the Treasury Department referred to Boyarkin as \"a former GRU officer who reports directly to Deripaska and has led business negotiations on Deripaska's behalf.\" The GRU is Russia's military intelligence agency.\n\nDeripaska was sanctioned earlier this year as part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to punish the Kremlin over interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDeripaska connection\n\nManafort worked for Deripaska about a decade ago, providing investment and consulting services to the Russian billionaire, according to both men.\n\nBut in 2014, lawyers for Deripaska filed a petition in a Cayman Islands court accusing Manafort of having \"simply disappeared\" with about $19 million of his money, Time reported. In a lawsuit earlier this year , Deripaska also accused Manafort and others of \"vanishing\" $26 million he gave them a decade ago. The lawsuit, which Deripaska filed in New York state following Manafort's indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller, is now paused because of the criminal matter.\n\nBoyarkin told Time that his connection to Manafort dates back to 2006. Manafort had a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska that began in 2006, the Associated Press reported last year , citing several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. The contract came after Manafort pitched a confidential proposal to Deripaska \"that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit (Russian) President Vladimir Putin's government,\" the AP reported.\n\nManafort told AP at the time that the contract was not pro-Russian in nature, and a representative of Deripaska told the news organization that the contract was for \"investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr. Deripaska.\"\n\nManafort was found guilty in August of eight counts of financial crimes, including tax fraud, bank fraud, and hiding foreign bank accounts. He pleaded guilty in September to one count of conspiracy against the US and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department.\n\nBut earlier this month , Mueller accused Manafort of lying about several issues after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, including his \"contact with administration officials\" --- violating his plea agreement.\n\nManafort is scheduled to receive his first sentence, for the eight financial convictions decided by a Virginia jury, in early February.\n\nHis second sentencing date, before the judge who's handling the breach of his plea agreement, is tentatively set for early March."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Court filing in Russian troll farm case references nude selfie", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/coMm65qytrA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Russian company told a federal court Thursday that it believes that among the terabytes of data collected by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is a nude selfie.\n\nConcord Management and Catering -- without providing information on who is depicted in the nude selfie -- questions whether there could be national security concerns related to such a holding.\n\n\"Could the manner in which he collected a nude selfie really threaten the national security of the United States,\" Concord's lawyers ask in the filing.\n\nConcord's filing Thursday comes amid a drawn-out fight where the Russian company seeks to access what the Justice Department says is \"sensitive\" evidence in the case, which could reveal national security and American investigative secrets to powerful foreigners.\n\nThe company is objecting to Mueller's request to share classified information with the judge that is kept secret and protected from Concord's lawyers' view.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "CNN uses gumballs to show Trump's multiplying false claims", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/clp0pouQblU/victor-blackwell-gumball-trump-false-claims-newday-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The Supreme Court action also paused fines the company was facing for every day of noncompliance.\n\nRoberts could now refer the matter to the full court to determine the next step.\n\nIt would take votes from five justices to keep in place the pause of the contempt citation if the Supreme Court decides to take up a full review of the lower court rulings.\n\nThe company's challenge of the subpoena appears to have begun in September. In its ruling this past week, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia offered few clues about the company and its country of origin or what Mueller's team sought.\n\nThere's a vast range of possibilities on the identity of the company. The company could be anything from a sovereign-owned bank to a state-backed technology or information company. Those types of corporate entities have been frequent recipients of requests for information in Mueller's investigation.\n\nAnd though Mueller's work focused on the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, prosecutors have said and CNN has reported that the Mueller team looked at actions related to Turkish, Ukrainian and other foreign government interests.\n\nThe company in the Supreme Court challenge has stayed secret -- as has the grand jury proceeding it's related to. And both the company, prosecutors and the circuit court took pains to keep the identities of those involved in the case under wraps. An entire floor of the DC federal courthouse was locked down by security on the morning of the company's appeal argument so that the lawyers entering and leaving the courtroom would not be seen."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump transition team under Mueller's microscope", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/KGJ9gTtrVwM/trump-transition-team-russia-investigation-kaye-dnt-ac360-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Beijing has begun pushing for a greater stake in the region with a view to opening new trade routes, exploring for oil and gas and conducting research on climate change, experts say.\n\nGeographically, China is nowhere near the Arctic Circle, which puts the Asian powerhouse at a major political disadvantage compared to eight countries that make up the Arctic Council, all of whom have territory inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nCouncil members are divided on China's growing interest in the region. Some smaller economies like Iceland and Norway see an opportunity, others with a strategic interest like Russia and Canada are growing wary.\n\nChina isn't the only non-Arctic state interested in the region but it is by far the biggest, China and polar region expert Marc Lanteigne of Massey University in New Zealand told CNN.\n\nIn 2013 it joined India, South Korea, Japan and Singapore in gaining non-voting observer status on the Council.\n\n\"Overall, there's been the acceptance that China is going to be a player there, but there is still some concern about the ambiguity to what China's endgame is,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nArctic Council foreign ministers with then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on May 11, 2017.\n\nPolar silk road\n\nIn January, Beijing published its first Arctic strategy white paper, claiming a vested interest in the region while attempting to allay fears over its territorial ambitions.\n\nIt defines itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" in the document, saying environmental changes in the Arctic have a \"direct impact on China's climate system and ecological environment.\"\n\nThe white paper details Beijing's plans for a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure program, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping whose government has spent big to build vast trade corridors across the world.\n\nWhile the Belt and Road initiative has drawn criticism in the West due to concerns that China is ensnaring developing countries in debt, Lanteigne says it's welcomed by some of the smaller Arctic players keen on building economic ties with Beijing.\n\n\"It has excited quite a few of the Nordic states who see the possibility of expanded Chinese sea traffic and potentially new ports,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nThe idea of a mutually beneficial partnership is exactly the reassuring message China sought to drive home in its Arctic policy, with repeated references to \"cooperation.\"\n\nMelting sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast on March 30, 2017 above Greenland.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to Arctic Council concerns before China's admission, when members feared it could seek to repeat its South China Sea territorial grab in the Arctic Circle.\n\nBeijing claims an enormous swath of territory in the South China Sea, and has created heavily fortified artificial islands to help assert its position in the Spratly and Paracel island chains.\n\nIn comparison, the situation in the Arctic is relatively peaceful, according to experts, with no serious territorial disputes. And the Arctic states are eager to keep it that way.\n\n'Brimming with economic potential'\n\nBeijing claims the main reason for its interest in the Arctic is scientific research.\n\nIn the white paper, it detailed a desire to investigate the effects of climate change to \"resolve global environmental issues.\"\n\nBut skeptics have argued that China's Arctic ambitions are largely fueled by the economic and political appeal of dominating a resource-rich area.\n\nIt is estimated that the Arctic may hold nearly one-third of the world's natural gas and 13% of global oil reserves, according to a report by Rachael Gosnell at the University of Maryland.\n\nAnd as rising temperatures melt the region's ice, shipping routes that were once impassible are now an attractive and feasible alternative for the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The Arctic is brimming with economic potential,\" said Gosnell, who estimates that the annual economy of the region exceeds $450 billion.\n\nAccording to NASA, some global climate models predict the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months by the middle of this century, likely making its waters an important shipping route.\n\n\"China really wants to put itself in a position whereby, should there be some kind of scramble or push for Arctic resources, China would be very well placed to take advantage of that,\" said Lanteigne, the polar region expert.\n\nTo secure that position, it is strengthening its Arctic capabilities. In September, China launched a second icebreaker known as Xue Long 2, or Snow Dragon 2, with an expedition scheduled for the first half of 2019, according to state-run media.\n\nThe newly minted vessel is the first Chinese-built icebreaker. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation claims it will be more capable of cutting through ice and carrying out advanced research than its foreign-built predecessor.\n\nChina's first domestically-built icebreaker, Xuelong 2, during a launch ceremony at a shipyard in Shanghai in September.\n\nWashington's loss, Beijing's gain\n\nChina has been quick to recognize the importance of investing in the Arctic at a time when there are few participants and even fewer laws, so that it can eventually restructure Arctic governance in its favor, said Harriet Moynihan, associate fellow at the UK think tank Chatham House.\n\nChina's increasing involvement in the Arctic Circle has also coincided with a growing lack of interest from Washington.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to eliminate a special envoy and representative for the Arctic region in 2017, as climate change dropped down the list of priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet. In 2018 only two functioning icebreakers remain, one of which is a heavy-duty vessel overdue for an update.\n\nThe Obama administration pursued an ambitious Arctic strategy to ensure the US remained a strong power in regional affairs, including plans to replace the heavy icebreaker by 2020.\n\nBut it's unclear where the US now stands on those plans. The US Coast Guard, which runs the icebreakers, faces significant budget cuts as more and more funding is reconsidered for border security.\n\n\"Because of the fact that the Arctic is not a priority for the Trump government, this has allowed China to take the steering wheel and accelerate their own Arctic policies,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nRussia is arguably the most active Arctic state, with a fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, and it is reluctant to allow non-Arctic countries to develop the region.\n\nBut facing mounting Western sanctions, Moscow's attitude toward China has warmed considerably. \"Russia realized that China was one of the few countries left that could really help with Siberian development,\" Lanteigne said.\n\n\"The two countries have cooperated in a number of Arctic ventures, including a liquefied natural gas project.\"\n\nWith large parts of the Arctic still difficult for China to reach, it remains less important to Beijing than investments in other parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia.\n\nBut China's presence in the far north is only likely to grow -- whether the Arctic states are pleased about it or not."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "14th suspect arrested in Morocco tourist beheadings", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/duhefKc-tVA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A 14th person was arrested Saturday in connection with the beheading deaths of two Scandinavian tourists, according to the state-run Maghreb Arab Press.\n\nMoroccan authorities took the suspect into custody in the southwestern city of Marrakech.

The opinions in this article belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Details of what happened October 2 were being drip-fed by Turkish officials with the narrative skill of TV scriptwriters hooking a global audience into an addictive box set.\n\nThe popular journalist and affable raconteur Jamal Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nHe'd been suffocated. His body had disappeared. He was allegedly chopped into pieces with a bone saw brought on a private plane.\n\nThere were various suggestions that his remains had been dissolved into acid, stuffed down a well or wrapped in a blanket and taken away by a local \"collaborator.\"\n\nAs the saga unfolded, the US Senate voted to accuse Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of being behind the killing.\n\nBut there's a subplot that might give this body bag of a story a silver lining.\n\nSaudi Arabia admitted, eventually, that The Washington Post columnist had indeed been killed, but that this was not sanctioned by the royal court. Rather, it was a unilateral decision taken on the ground by the head of a team that was supposed, at worst, to abduct Khashoggi and drag him back to the kingdom.\n\nWhatever the Saudis claim, the abiding result of the Khashoggi tragedy has been to paint Saudi Arabia as a vicious, uncivilized land run by a despotic family. Not as the forward-thinking nation and leading light of the modern Islamic world that its crown prince would like to project.\n\nOne Saudi critic of the royal court replied to a text I sent him from Riyadh in the first fortnight of covering the story in which I asked, \"Whodunnit?\"\n\n\"Don Corleone.\"\n\nBy referring to the fictitious mafia leader in \"The Godfather,\" the man was perhaps risking his life. Most other contacts in Riyadh to whom I spoke were circumspect to say the least -- sticking firmly to whatever the prevailing narrative was being spun out of the royal court.\n\nSo I deleted his text, removed his number from my contacts' list both in my phone and on the cloud -- and destroyed any notes that could have led an investigator to him.\n\nNot since the 1980 docudrama \"Death of a Princess,\" which alleged that Princess Mishaal bint Fahd al Saud was executed on the orders of her grandfather, and her alleged lover beheaded, has Saudi Arabia suffered such reputational damage.\n\nJUST WATCHED Time magazine names 2018 Person of the Year Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Time magazine names 2018 Person of the Year 00:57\n\nThat film, shown on the UK's ITV and on PBS in the United States, resulted in the expulsion of Britain's ambassador to Riyadh.\n\nKhashoggi's killing has led once hard-line, pro-Saudi Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker to turn on the kingdom with a vengeance.\n\nAfter meeting with CIA Director Gina Haspel, both senators concluded that the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS, was complicit in the unlawful killing.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" Graham said after the briefing from the CIA boss.\n\nDonald Trump's view of whether MBS knew of or ordered the killing is less clear. \"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't,\" the US President said -- even though he has had the same information from the CIA.\n\nTrump's critics accused him of having a tin ear for human rights and a fetish for powerful men -- a view reinforced by his apparent crush on his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut as he has observed many times, Saudi Arabia is a vitally important US ally. Indeed, it's a stalwart of the West's fight against violent political Islam, part of the US-led coalition standing against Iran's regional meddling, and the world's second-biggest producer of crude oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a vital economic partner, a major consumer of American weapons and an intimate friend when it comes to regional intelligence sharing.\n\nIt's also involved in a war in Yemen, which has killed an estimated 85,000 children , according to Save the Children. Another 14 million are at risk of starvation -- among them 400,000 children who are, the United Nations says, on the brink of hunger.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which supports the internationally recognized government of Yemen in its fight against the Iranian-backed Houthis, shows no signs of being able to win the war or stave off the humanitarian disaster.\n\nSo it's agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nSaudi Arabia cannot afford to be seen, or accused, of causing a famine on its doorstep.\n\nReeling from the fallout of the Khashoggi case, which it can do little about given the presumption of guilt that's attached itself to the kingdom's most powerful figure, Saudi Arabia needs to do and be seen to be doing \"the right thing.\"\n\nThat means backing away from war into peace in Yemen.\n\nIt's an unintended but welcome potential ending to the Khashoggi saga's subplot."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Hotel employees who asked black guest to leave fired", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/6YJYXz8Vm9M/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two employees seen on video asking a black guest to leave a Portland, Oregon, hotel after he took a phone call in the lobby have been let go, the facility said Saturday on Twitter.\n\nThe incident took place December 22 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Portland.\n\nJermaine Massey was in the hotel lobby when a security guard informed him that police were on their way to escort him off the property.\n\nMassey accused the guard of \"harassing\" him, and in a statement provided to CNN by his attorneys, characterized the incident as \"calling his mother while black.\"\n\n\"We have terminated the employment of the two men involved in the mistreatment of Mr. Massey,\" the hotel said on Twitter.\n\n\"Their actions were inconsistent with our standards & values.

David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told CNN in a statement. \"A government shutdown doesn't hurt any one political party or any one federal employee more than another, it hurts all of them.\"\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees is a labor union that represents over 700,000 federal employees at several agencies.\n\nA representative of AFGE local chapter 1637, who is an employee at the Bureau of Prisons in Texas, said that she does not support the shutdown. The employee is considered \"essential,\" so she is working without pay during the shutdown.\n\n\"Personally, I'm like, what federal employees are you talking to? Because it's not people at my institution,\" she told CNN. \"None of us want the government shut down. None of us want to be working and not getting paid. Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, Green parties, all of us that work, at least at my facility, we want to get paid.\"\n\nThis federal employee works the overnight shift at her job. She is engaged and planning a July wedding. This week, she missed putting deposits down at her wedding reception venue and church. She also canceled an appointment to start getting her wedding dress made next week. She's worried that if she puts those payments down now, and the shutdown continues, she won't be able to pay her rent and other more pressing bills in the coming months.\n\n\"That's thousands of dollars that I can't just put out somewhere not knowing when I'm going to get paid again,\" she said. \"My well-being is not at stake, but my dreams and hopes for something in life are being fractured and highly possibly shattered.\"\n\nShe said that because some people are frustrated they are not getting paid and still have to work, they are not showing up to work. This means that she and some others at her facility are also working mandatory overtime during this period.\n\nShe expressed frustration with some of the comments being made by lawmakers in Washington.\n\n\"As federal employees, when statements are made, the effects and attitudes that respond from it are negative and frustration, because you are not in our shoes. You're not experiencing what we're experiencing,\" she said. \"If the shoe were on the other foot, if you took a day at my job, would you really feel like what you're doing right now is right?\"\n\nAcross the country, the Esparza family in Kent, Washington, along with some 42,000 other active duty Coast Guard members, will not be paid during the shutdown.\n\nThe Coast Guard is the only military branch that isn't paid during the government shutdown; they technically are part of the Department of Homeland Security. However, the Coast Guard announced Friday night that the administration has identified a way to ensure \"military members that served on active duty in the month of December and those reserve military members that drilled prior to the lapse in appropriation\" will get paid on December 31.\n\n\"This isn't our first rodeo,\" Jacqui Esparza says, but she's expecting it to be the worst one ever. Her husband, Joshua, has been in the Coast Guard for 14 years.\n\nNow, the Esparzas are trying to get a hold on what bills must be paid, and what can wait.\n\n\"First thing was we can get almost all the bills paid, but what are we going to do about rent, because our rent comes from my husband's pay, which includes housing allowance,\" she says. \"Without that we can't afford the Seattle area.\"\n\nEsparza estimates that they'll incur about $200 in late fees; money her family doesn't have -- especially after the holidays.\n\nThe pain doesn't stop in their bank accounts. Jacqui Esparza is mourning the loss of their grandfather.\n\nThe airfare cost is just another financial hit to their bank account.\n\n\"The politicians can bicker all the want on Capital Hill,\" she says. \"But stop using the military and their pay as a bargaining chip.\"\n\nShutdown stretches into second week\n\nWhile some federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Smithsonian museums were able to use other funds to remain open for the first week of the shutdown, as the shutdown enters week two, those funds have dried up.\n\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an email to agency staff on Dec. 27 informing them that if a shutdown deal was not reached by midnight on Dec. 28, the agency would begin orderly shutdown procedures. The Smithsonian announced that all museums, research centers and facilities, including the National Zoo, would close starting Jan. 2 if a shutdown deal was not reached.\n\nAt the National Zoo in Washington, DC, all animals will continue to be fed and cared for during the shutdown, but live animal cams, including the popular Panda Cam, would no longer broadcast once the zoo closes.\n\nAccording to the zoo's website, the cameras require \"federal resources, primarily staff, to run\" and are \"deemed non-essential.\"\n\nNational Parks across the country remain \"as accessible as possible,\" during the shutdown, according to an agency spokesperson. For some parks, state and city governments have stepped in to cover funding and keep them open.\n\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state would provide funding to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open. In Philadelphia, a local nonprofit organization, VISIT PHILADELPHIA, donated money to keep Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell open for three days starting Dec. 28.\n\n\"People come to New York, they come to see the sights, and it's important at this dark time in our country to keep the torch on the Statue of Liberty lit, metaphorically,\" Cuomo said on radio station WAMC on Dec. 27."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Departing senators warn: There's a problem with the current state of politics", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/CVVOLAs_G7Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As departing senators said their goodbyes to Washington, a number of Democrats and Republicans took the opportunity to express concern about the state of the Senate and the political climate.\n\n\"All the evidence points to an unsettling truth: The Senate as an institution is in crisis,\" retiring Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah lamented in his farewell speech delivered on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill , who was defeated in the November midterm elections, echoed that idea when she delivered her own farewell speech . \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was worried about this place,\" she said. \"It just doesn't work as well as it used to.\"\n\n\"Something is broken,\" the Missouri Democrat went on to say. \"If we don't have the strength to look in the mirror and fix it, the American people are going to grow more and more cynical.\"\n\nAs senators who were either ousted in the elections or decided to retire and not seek another term reflected on their time in Congress, many expressed dismay at how divided Washington has become as lawmakers retreat to entrenched partisan positions that leave little room for compromise or common ground.\n\nMost of them spoke in the final weeks of the year, a time largely overshadowed by a flurry of last-minute legislative activity and an unsuccessful effort to stave off a partial government shutdown. But the shuttering of roughly 25% of the federal government appeared to help illustrate a common sentiment conveyed during many of these farewell speeches: that something would need to change for Washington to function properly.\n\n'This is not a normal time'\n\nMcCaskill and Hatch weren't the only ones sounding alarm bells.\n\n\"To say that our politics is not healthy is somewhat of an understatement,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake said in his farewell speech . \"I believe that we all know well that this is not a normal time and that the threats to our democracy from within and without are real.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump , went beyond a critique of American politics to say he believes an \"authoritarian impulse\" is experiencing a resurgence worldwide and that the \"global commitment to democracy seems now to be on somewhat shaky ground.\"\n\nBut while departing senators had unique messages to impart, the overarching idea that there's a problem with the current state of politics was a consistent theme.\n\n\"What in the world has happened to civility and to humility in our nation's public discourse?\" Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who lost his seat in the midterms, asked in his farewell speech.\n\n\"Tribalism is our problem, and if not corrected, it's going to take our country down,\" he warned.\n\nYear marked by 'loss of comity'\n\nThe farewell speeches came as the most recent session of Congress drew to a close in late December -- a session that has been punctuated by a series of bitterly contentious fights on Capitol Hill.\n\nTensions ran high between Democratic and Republican senators during the confirmation hearings. In one dramatic moment, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina accused his Democratic colleagues of trying to \"destroy\" Kavanaugh's life for political gain.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham has message for Kavanaugh daughters Replay More Videos ...

Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- sided with Senate Republicans to elevate Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nHatch said during his farewell speech that \"many factors contribute to the current dysfunction,\" but added, \"If I were to identify the root of the crisis it would be this: the loss of comity and genuine good feeling among Senate colleagues.\"\n\nIn yet another sign of division between the two parties, 2018 started off with a government shutdown at the end of January and ended with another fight in December, when a standoff between Trump and Democrats over funding for a border wall triggered a partial shutdown that began just days before Christmas\n\nDon't be afraid of 'tough votes' and other advice\n\nAs departing senators outlined concerns in their farewell speeches, many described what they believe has contributed to the highly divisive political climate and what they think needs to change.\n\nMcCaskill urged lawmakers to have the courage to take \"tough votes.\"\n\n\"Solving the toughest problems will not happen without tough votes,\" she said. \"We can talk about the toughest problems ... we can argue about them, we can campaign on them, but we're not going to solve them without tough votes.\"\n\nNelson and outgoing Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who also lost his seat in the midterms, suggested that an influx of big money in politics has had a corrosive effect, making an argument common to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The court's 2010 decision opened the floodgates and allowed the wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections and corrupt our democracy,\" Nelson said, referring to the landmark 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn his farewell speech, Donnelly said that \"the divisive rhetoric, the political campaigns, increasingly funded by tens of millions of dollars, anonymous, dark money interests is really doing damage to this country.\"\n\nNelson argued that another issue is the \"constant attempts to disenfranchise voters and make it more difficult for every American to have their voice heard at the ballot box.\"\n\nHatch, meanwhile, decried \"identity politics,\" a concept often invoked critically by Republicans, who frequently accuse Democrats of subscribing to it.\n\n\"We must reject the politics of division, starting with identity politics,\" the Utah Republican said, adding that \"identity politics is nothing more than dressed-up tribalism. It is the deliberate and often unnatural segregation of people into categories for political gain.\"\n\n'I love this place'\n\nIn their farewell speeches, departing senators also reflected on fond memories of their time in Congress, and some expressed optimism for the future despite their concerns.\n\n\"For all the problems I've outlined, know that I love this place,\" McCaskill said. \"We have fought, we have cried and we have laughed together. Just like family.\"\n\n\"For more than four decades, I have had the distinct privilege of serving in the United States Senate,\" Hatch said , adding, \"speaking on the Senate floor, debating legislation in committee, corralling the support of our colleagues on compromise legislation -- these are the moments I will miss. These are the memories I will cherish forever.\"\n\nHatch went on to say that \"to address this body is to experience a singular feeling: a sense that you are a part of something bigger than yourself, a minor character in the grand narrative that is America.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See Flake's goodbye speech on Senate floor Replay More Videos ...

But whether he'll actually be sworn in as a member of Congress next week remains up in the air, as he would need a court to quickly rule that he is entitled to the seat -- because the state board did not certify the result, there is no legal authority outside of a court order to allow him to take his seat.\n\nAnd House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is set to take on the position of majority leader in the next Congress, said Democrats will work to ensure Harris is not seated.\n\n\"Given the now well-documented election fraud that took place in NC-09, Democrats would object to any attempt by Mr. Harris to be seated on January 3,\" Hoyer said in a statement. \"In this instance, the integrity of our democratic process outweighs concerns about the seat being vacant at the start of the new Congress.\"\n\nHoyer later told CNN's Jim Acosta on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\" \"My own view is, we probably ought to redo the general election.\"\n\nThe decision to disband the board represents a jarring reversal by state Republicans who earlier this month had all but endorsed the need for new elections amid mounting evidence of election fraud on behalf of the Harris campaign and a report that early voter data had been leaked in Bladen County.\n\nThe filing came a day after a three-judge state court panel denied a stay to keep the state elections board, which is investigating the allegations, in its current form and ordered the board to dissolve at noon Friday.\n\nThe board had refused to certify Harris as November's winner amid evidence of irregularities in the absentee ballot count and reports of a fraud scheme directed by a Republican operative hired by Harris' campaign.\n\nHarris leads in the unofficial tally of the 2018 election by 905 votes over Democratic candidate Dan McCready.\n\nIn a statement, McCready ripped Harris and his campaign.\n\n\"Over the past month, it has become abundantly clear that North Carolinians had their voices silenced during the election in North Carolina's Ninth District,\" McCready said in a statement. \"Mark Harris and his allies promised to support a complete investigation into this attack on our democracy. He has now broken this promise and is instead doing all he can to obstruct this bipartisan investigation into the illegal election activities within his own campaign.\n\n\"All North Carolinians -- regardless of party -- deserve a swift and complete investigation without panicked obstruction from Mark Harris. Now more than ever we deserve to know what Mark Harris knew and when he knew it.\"\n\nIn its petition, the Harris campaign wrote to the board that it, \"is not aware of irregularities or other concerns sufficient in number to change the outcome of the election in the 9th district.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, before filing the petition, Harris told WBT radio in Charlotte he is willing to take the fight to court if the board doesn't certify the results of the election.\n\nThough the board has dissolved, board staffers can continue to work on the investigation, but they will not be able to issue subpoenas, hold hearings or call for a new election, said Josh Lawson, the board's general counsel.\n\n\"As you know, your client (Harris) is under a subpoena dated December 1, but has made only one production on December 7 totaling 398 pages,\" the board's former chair Joshua Malcolm wrote in its response to the Harris campaign's petition. \"Yet your client through counsel indicated that you possess roughly 140,000 additional documents that may be responsive but have not yet been produced. We have received repeated assurances\u2014as recently as December 24\u2014regarding your efforts to comply with the subpoena.\n\nHe added, \"You are hereby requested to fully comply with the Board's subpoena so as to not further impact the agency's ability to resolve the investigation.\"\n\nMalcolm also said board staffers have attempted to schedule an interview with Harris, whose team has indicated he is willing to sit down for an interview.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Party's executive director Dallas Woodhouse said Harris has been cooperating with the board's investigation.\n\n\"He's not required to send to a Democrat every piece of paper a campaign ever put forward,\" Woodhouse said Friday on CNN's \"Newsroom.\" \"By the way, it is irrelevant. The board of elections needed to establish that these things happened, that they happened at all. Mr. Harris only ever touched his ballot. His. He doesn't have anything to add. This was an absolutely atrocious smear by a disgraced democrat elections chair, the former chair now on the way out. It is unconscionable.\"\n\nWoodhouse told CNN that the three-judge panel recognized that the board of elections, led by Malcolm, \"was going to just continue a never-ending fishing expedition.\"\n\nHe predicted that the federal court would order the state of North Carolina to certify the November results.\n\nThe board had planned to hold an evidentiary hearing in the case on January 11, 2019.\n\nThe board's current structure had been struck down before the 2018 election, but the court had delayed implementing that order until now.\n\nIn their ruling Thursday, the judges said the board had not complied with previous court orders and that they had not provided enough information about why the hearing had been delayed.\n\nA new board to be appointed\n\nThere is also uncertainty over the makeup of the elections board. A new state law requires Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to appoint a new board, but not until January 31, 2019.\n\nIn a letter Friday to both state party chairs, Cooper said he will appoint a temporary five-member board under the old rules to preside until the end of January \"to hasten the investigatory work by the Board and maintain continuity.\"\n\nState Republicans have said Cooper does not have the authority to do so and plan to challenge that in court as well. The party has also said they will not accept appointments to the temporary board Cooper is trying to establish.\n\nThe state elections board had been expected to call for a new election in early 2019 if it was able to corroborate the evidence of irregularities in the 9th district race.\n\nState Democratic Party officials have called for a new election in the district, and Republicans largely conceded a few weeks ago that a second vote will likely be necessary. The state legislature overrode the governor's veto of a bill that requires any call for a new election to also provide for another primary, which would give Republicans a chance to replace Harris before a rematch with McCready.\n\nA Democratic strategist familiar with the situation accused the Republican Party of doing a complete turnaround in its position from letting the board continue its investigation to attempting to certify the election results Friday.\n\n\"The new position coming from the Woodhouse camp is surprising,\" the strategist said. \"They have a lot of explaining to do. They have produced no evidence to the state board of elections, their candidate has refused to comply with the subpoenas, given no evidence, and are they are trying to strong-arm the state board of elections into taking no further action.\"\n\nWayne Goodwin, the chair of the state Democratic Party, went further.\n\n\"Mark Harris is trying to steal this election. It is obstruction of an investigation,\" Goodwin said Friday in an interview on CNN's \"Newsroom.\"\n\nHe added later, \"Governor Cooper is trying to do his best within the law so we can have a board established and it will be established under the last constitutional law to get the job done. There is ample evidence provided publicly and I'm confident there is more evidence that the Republicans apparently don't want us to see. This is obstruction of an investigation.\"\n\nThe investigation\n\nOfficials are in the process of reviewing evidence of absentee ballot fraud allegedly orchestrated by Leslie McRae Dowless, whose efforts potentially helped Harris win Bladen County.\n\n\"To date, the State Board's investigative staff has conducted more than 100 interviews, and the staff is actively engaged in the review of more than 182,000 pages of materials produced in response to 12 subpoenas issued by the State Board,\" Joshua Malcolm, the Democratic chair of the board, said in an affidavit filed in court on December 21.\n\nHarris has denied any wrongdoing. In his interview with WBT radio, Harris defended his decision to hire Dowless, saying that the GOP operative was recommended to him by political leaders he trusted in the state.\n\nHarris claimed specifically that Dowless said he does not collect, or \"harvest,\" absentee ballots, which Dowless is accused of doing and is an illegal practice in North Carolina.\n\nHe also floated a conspiracy theory that the elections board, which is made up of both Republican and Democratic members, purposely held on to that information to prevent him from winning the election.\n\n\"Did they decide that they would sit on this and they would wait, and they would see and somehow if $11 million and Dan McCready couldn't beat Mark Harris, this would be an insurance policy that they would play to get a do-over?\" Harris asked. \"I would hate to think that we had an agency in our state government that would operate with that kind of sinister leadership, but I am telling you the facts are the facts, they sat on this and we could've known what was happening there, and I just think it is sad.\"\n\nThe state's Republican Party applauded the Harris' campaign's decision to file a petition in court.\n\n\"It is important to note that no serious evidence of some of the most concerning allegations including widespread destruction of ballots ever materialized,\" North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement Friday. \"There is simply no concrete evidence to show that even the mishandling of some absentee ballots amounted to a change of more than a thousand votes in this race.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "House Democrats scooping up staff, lawyers to power Trump investigations", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/qES6UbJrsoY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "A recent committee job posting reviewed by CNN asked for legislative counsels with a variety of expertise: \"criminal law, immigration law, constitutional law, intellectual property law, commercial and administrative law (including antitrust and bankruptcy), or oversight work.\"\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee needs lawyers, too, posting jobs for \"executive branch investigative counsel.\"\n\nThe advertisements give a window into the Democratic recruiting that's ramped up ahead of the party gaining subpoena power for the first time in eight years when it takes over the House in January.\n\nWhile Democrats publicly talk up their interest in focusing on legislative priorities like health care and voting rights -- not to mention ending the ongoing partial government shutdown -- they are quietly preparing for what will likely be the largest congressional investigation of a sitting president in recent memory. Party leaders and committee chairs have spent months ironing out potential targets, from President Donald Trump's taxes and business dealings to the conduct of current and former Cabinet members.\n\nTo handle all this investigative work, House Democrats are expected to double the number of their staffers. Though they can't officially hire anyone until the new Congress is seated, plans are well underway, with House members saying that candidates -- especially those with specific investigative skills, from money laundering to contracting -- are coming from all directions.\n\n\"They're finding us,\" said Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat who will be taking over the House Armed Services Committee, which will have a significant piece of foreign policy oversight. \"There are a lot of Democratic refugees out there after the Republicans took over the House, the Senate and the White House.\"\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who's a member of the Oversight Committee, said she ends up forwarding some of the resumes that come to her office to committee staffers in charge of hiring. \"They are people with law degrees and experience just wanting to be part of this historic moment,\" she said.\n\nThe hiring efforts started early. One Democratic House committee posted a help-wanted ad on a job board frequented by Capitol Hill staffers the day after the November 6 midterm elections. The post, which did not name the committee, sought \"investigative counsel to conduct congressional investigations and advise on policy matters related to oversight of the executive branch.\"\n\n\"Responsibilities include staffing letters and subpoenas, conducting interviews, organizing and staffing hearings and preparing memos, talking points, statements and reports as necessary,\" the listing stated. \"Previous congressional or executive branch experience preferred, but candidates with diverse backgrounds and experiences are encouraged to apply. Candidates must have attention to detail, excellent writing skills, excel under pressure and have a sense of humor.\"\n\nOne person familiar with the Democratic ramp-up in staffing told CNN, \"There are a lot of people willing to take pay cuts to come do that work.\"\n\n\"We're being deluged with resumes, really impressive resumes. There will be no shortage of good candidates. The difficulty will be choosing among them,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who will lead the House Intelligence Committee next year and will play a key role in investigating Russian election interference.\n\nSchiff has signaled that he also wants to focus on questions about possible money laundering and the Trump Organization. A source familiar with the Intelligence Committee's planning tells CNN that Schiff is looking to hire investigative staff with expertise in financial crimes.\n\nThat could overlap with work that Rep. Maxine Waters of California intends to pursue. Waters will lead the Financial Services Committee, and has been pressing for an investigation into potential money laundering, particularly involving Trump's loans with Deutsche Bank.\n\nCoordination\n\nTo ensure investigations don't devolve into a confusing mass of overlapping inquiries and turf wars, coordination will be key for likely incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Likely Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland has agreed to meet weekly with committee chairs to discuss priorities, according to a source familiar with the matter. Party leaders have also told incoming committee chairs to work out turf fights in private rather than hashing out who has jurisdiction over what in public.\n\nThat won't be easy. Many of the big stories and scandals don't fit neatly into one committee or another, and certain chairmen will have far more authority than others. That's particularly true with Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the incoming chair of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform committee, which has sweeping authority over the entire federal government.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Cummings downplayed the potential of any turf fights . \"We're not going to step on each other's toes,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that if there is jurisdiction that we work that out in private and then go to our committees and do what we have to do.\"\n\nAides warn that it will likely be months before the public sees the full scope of investigations.\n\n\"I think Democrats will be ready, but there is also going to be hundreds of thousands of documents requested and produced. It is going to be a little bit of drinking out of a fire hose in the beginning,\" one source familiar with planning told CNN.\n\nWhile there's been careful planning already underway about which investigations to pursue, new developments could alter the Democrats' strategy. After a second child died in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection this month , for instance, Pelosi announced that Democrats would be investigating the issue.\n\nPelosi also announced on Friday she plans to appoint Douglas Letter to be the new House general counsel, a nonpartisan role that could nonetheless be pivotal in court battles that may erupt between the House and Trump administration next year.\n\nLetter had a 40-year career at the Justice Department before retiring earlier this year, including as White House associate counsel in the Clinton administration. In September, he wrote an op-ed raising concerns about whether the Trump Justice Department would allow Mueller's final report to become public -- an issue that now could wind up on his desk.\n\nProtecting Mueller\n\nFor Democrats emphasizing the need to focus on legislative rather than investigative priorities, there is one move that could arguably do both: passing legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAccording to one Democratic aide, a bill to protect the special counsel from interference is expected to be among the first items Democrats pursue. Such legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year but was never put to a vote on the floor. That bill will give House Democrats an avenue to pressure the GOP-led Senate to act, too, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has shown no interest in taking up the measure, even after outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona launched a blockade on confirming judges over the lack of a floor vote on the measure.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation has to be protected, absolutely,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat. \"There's a lot of consensus on our side that will be a key priority.\"\n\nThe Mueller probe provides an interesting test for Democratic chairmen and chairwomen. While it could do some of the work for them by providing new details, it will also tempt many of them to go after what he uncovers.\n\nThe sentencing of Michael Cohen, for instance -- in which federal prosecutors said Trump had directed Cohen to commit campaign finance crimes by paying women not to speak about alleged affairs -- makes him a potential witness before multiple committees.\n\nCummings said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" earlier this month that he wanted Cohen to testify in January, and that his committee could be the appropriate venue.\n\n\"Quite possibly,\" Cummings told CNN when asked whether his committee would investigate Cohen's crimes. \"We're still trying to figure out who's doing what. Because the last thing we want to do is stepping on each other's toes. Somebody's going to get into it.\"\n\nCohen has already testified before Schiff's committee, admitting in his November guilty plea that he had lied before the panel about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project. Schiff might want to haul Cohen back in to explain himself on that matter, though Schiff was already ceding the investigation of payments to women to Cummings the day after the story broke.\n\nTrump's taxes\n\nAt the center of Democrats' efforts is the pursuit of Trump's tax returns. While modern presidents have handed over their returns willingly, Democrats are prepared to force the issue, arguing Trump has defied precedent.\n\nRep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he intends to use an arcane IRS code that allows his committee to ask the Treasury Department for the President's returns.\n\nNeal -- a business-minded Democrat who has earned a reputation as a willing negotiator -- had hoped Trump would be willing to negotiate and turn over his tax returns without a fight. But in recent weeks, comments from Trump's allies have made it clear that asking nicely would be a waste of time. A source close to the process told CNN that Neal was prepared to make a formal request to the Treasury Department in the new Congress. When that would take place was still undecided.\n\n\"We're not doing this by a knee jerk,\" said Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey. \"We've got research up the gazoo behind us and the law's on our side.\"\n\nDepending on what's in them, Trump's tax returns could provide information that would feed investigations by other committees.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of information in them that would be of interest to my committee. For example, we'd like to know exactly what our, what has been the sources of income for this President,\" Cummings said. \"He's made all kinds of claims that he doesn't have relationships with Russia. He told us he didn't have any relationships with Russia; we come to find out that's not accurate. So there've been a lot of allegations, but I think the tax returns, where he has to swear that the information is accurate, that would tell us a lot.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "American doctor will be monitored in US after possible exposure to Ebola in Congo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/WwbbbIFHnsc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An American was possibly exposed to Ebola while recently providing medical assistance in Congo, according to a release from the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n\nThe person, who has not been identified, is headed to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha for monitoring, the release states, adding the Nebraska Medical Center is home to one of the nation's few dedicated biocontainment units.\n\n\"This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,\" said Ted Cieslak, infectious diseases specialist with Nebraska Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health. \"Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Medicine/UNMC team is among the most qualified in the world to deal with them.\"\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo is going through one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history.

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open .

Hispanic youth accounted for more than 10% of the deaths, while non-Hispanic black youth were about 7% of the death total.\n\nPrescription opioids accounted for 73% of the deaths, but heroin killed nearly 1,900 (about 24%) of those age 15 to 19.\n\nThe bulk of these opioid deaths, nearly 81% of them, were unintentional. Five percent were suicides and 2.4% were homicides. But for children younger than 5, nearly a quarter of the deaths were labeled homicides; among infants, it was closer to 35%.\n\nThe importance of place\n\nWhere children and adolescents died was also examined, since most other research has focused on results from emergency room visits and hospitalizations, the researchers said.\n\nThey pointed to one study that determined that about 2,000 children a year were hospitalized for opioid poisoning between 1997 and 2012, and \"a small number,\" about 30 each year, died while hospitalized.\n\nThe new report, however, puts the number of deaths per year at closer to 500. The new study's authors found that most deaths happened away from a medical setting, with 38% occurring in homes.\n\nThe researchers relied on data from death certificates, which they acknowledged might include some misclassifications of cause and manner of death.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut even with that possible limitation, they wrote, the problem for youth will likely grow \"unless legislators, public health officials, clinicians and parents take a wider view of the opioid crisis and implement protective measures that are pediatric-specific and family-centered.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Flu cases on the rise in the United States, CDC says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3C0IlvYtvbI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Flu activity is increasing in the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.\n\nAs of the week ending December 22, nine states are experiencing high flu activity -- Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Carolina -- as well as New York City.

I couldn't see any supporters of the opposition parties.\n\nThis disparity is visible on the streets of Dhaka as well, which are lined with rows and rows of posters of ruling party candidates. It's very hard to spot any campaign material from the opposition.\n\nOn the last day of canvassing, while there were big street marches held by supporters of Awami League, there was very little happening on the opposition side, just a few, small door to door campaigns.\n\nThey say this is because they weren't allowed to hold big political rallies, at least in the city of Dhaka. They've accused the election commission of bias, and say the police have been arbitrarily arresting and detaining opposition party members and supporters.\n\nWhen I asked Prime Minister Hasina about these allegations, she said they were not true."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Colombia probes alleged plot to assassinate President Iv\u00e1n Duque", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46714296", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:33", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Colombia's President Iv\u00e1n Duque has harshly criticised the Venezuelan government in the past\n\nColombia has condemned an alleged plot to assassinate its president, and says three Venezuelans have been arrested in connection with the plan.\n\nForeign minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said there were \"credible\" plans to target President Iv\u00e1n Duque.\n\nWithout going into details, Mr Trujillo also said three Venezuelans had been arrested with \"weapons of war\".\n\nTensions have risen between Colombia and Venezuela in recent months, with mutual expulsion of officials.\n\nMillions have fled Venezuela's severe economic crisis in recent years, and many of those migrants have crossed into Colombia.\n\nMr Duque was elected in August promising to isolate the country diplomatically.\n\n\"Intelligence investigations into possible attacks have been going on for several months,\" Mr Trujillo said in a video message, arguing the arrest of the three Venezuelans \"further increases concerns\".\n\nPolice and military sources in Colombia reportedly told Reuters news agency that three Venezuelan men were arrested earlier in December, two of whom were armed with rifles.\n\nPresident Duque has called on countries to not recognize Venezuela's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro after his contentious re-election in May, and dubbed the leader a \"dictator\".\n\nBut Mr Maduro alleges that Colombia and the US have plotted to kill him and topple his government.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Maduro has accused the US and Colombia of trying to kill him\n\nThe Venezuelan leader recently claimed US National Security Adviser John Bolton was personally involved in the assassination plan.\n\nThe arrival of Russian long-range bombers in Venezuela has further increased tensions in the region.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Russian bombers' visit amounted to \"two corrupt governments squandering public funds\".\n\nBut Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said they were part of air force exercises with its Russian allies: \"This we are going to do with our friends, because we have friends in the world who defend respectful, balanced relations.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Grandparents should be taken on family holidays, says minister", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46713493", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:00:34", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright UK Parliament\n\nGrandparents should be taken on family holidays, the minister responsible for tackling loneliness has said.\n\nMims Davies said British people could learn from how Mediterranean nations involve grandparents in their lives.\n\nThe new sport and civil society minister told the Sunday Telegraph that communities had a \"moral duty\" to stop the elderly feeling abandoned.\n\nA 2017 report said loneliness was as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\nMs Davies, who was appointed following the resignation of Tracey Crouch in November, said: \"Very often you will be out on holiday - a few of you in a small British family - and you will find this huge, wonderful plethora of people on the beach.\n\n\"And you will think, 'God, doesn't that look fun?'\n\n\"We are just a little bit blinkered.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

As Snoop would say, you must be sippin' on gin and juice.\n\n\n\nCrowd-size experts scoff at those mammoth figures \u2014 floated annually by city officials and event organizers \u2014 saying it's impossible to squeeze that many of even the skinniest revelers into such a relatively small space.\n\nThe real Times Square ball drop crowd most likely has fewer than 100,000 people, crowd science professor G. Keith Still said.\n\nSizable overestimate\n\n\"Generally, people are overestimating crowd sizes by 10- to 100-fold,\" said Still, who teaches crowd science at Manchester Metropolitan University in England and trains police departments on techniques to calculate crowd sizes.\n\nThe crowd estimates come from the New York City Police Department, according to the Times Square Alliance, which runs the ball drop.\n\nIn recent years, the department estimated that 2 million people had packed into Times Square. Mayor Bill de Blasio used a big number again Friday, saying the city expected \"up to 2 million people in Times Square itself,\" a bow-tie-shaped zone running five blocks between Broadway and Seventh Avenue.\n\nNew York University professor Charles Seife, a mathematician and journalist who explored statistical manipulation in his book Proofiness, said the city has an interest in promoting a bigger number because it \"helps cement the image of New York City as the center of the universe at a certain date and time.\"\n\nHe suggested fuzzy math and fuzzier geography were also at play.\n\n\"How do you count a participant in the Times Square ball drop?\" Seife asked. \"Is it everyone who can see the ball, or anyone squeezed into a bar in Manhattan?\"\n\nTo actually fit 1 million revelers, the city would have to jam more than the equivalent of a sold-out Yankee Stadium on every block of Seventh Avenue between Times Square and Central Park \u2014 which starts about 15 blocks to the north.\n\nStill and his colleagues perform detailed analyses when calculating precise crowd totals. But even using simple techniques, like measuring Times Square on a map and running a few calculations, it's clear the numbers don't get anywhere near 1 million.\n\nTimes Square would hold about 51,000 people at a density of three people per square meter, Still said, or about 86,000 at five people per square meter. It might reach 120,000 if the crowd packed in at seven people per square meter, but he said that density, involving people squished together front to back and shoulder to shoulder, is unlikely.\n\nThose numbers don't count people watching from hotel and office building windows or from penned-off areas farther away. They also don't account for space taken up by stages, security apparatus and egress routes, where people would otherwise be able to stand.\n\nNew York's crowd estimate has evolved over time. As late as 1998, the police department was estimating that roughly 500,000 people attended. But for the millennium bash at the close of 1999, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani predicted as many as 2 million.\n\nSafety concern\n\nAt big events, an accurate crowd estimate is critical to public safety. The wrong number can leave cities devoting too many or too few resources to an event, Still said. But New York \u2014 despite inflating the size of its crowd \u2014 manages the throngs well, funneling revelers into penned off areas so there's no opportunity for overcrowding, and screening each person for weapons.\n\nPolice are planning for 65 such pens this year, stretching well north of Times Square proper. To get 1 million people into those 65 pens, each would have to fit around 30,800 people.\n\nEstimating crowd sizes has long been subject to inexact guesswork and political pressure.\n\nArguments about crowd size flared after President Donald Trump claimed he had the largest presidential inauguration audience in history. The National Park Service stopped estimating crowds for events on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., after a dispute with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan over the attendance for his 1995 Million Man March.\n\nParades for victorious sports teams involve some of the most over-the-top estimates. Officials claimed 3.2 million people crammed the streets of Philadelphia for last year's Eagles Super Bowl parade.

Leaders of a national campaign to ban the practice are hopeful that at least four more states \u2014 Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts and New York \u2014 will join the ranks in the upcoming legislative sessions.\n\n\n\n\"We'd be disappointed if we don't get those this year \u2014 they're overdue,\" said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups campaigning to impose bans in all 50 states.\n\n\n\nThe campaign has gained momentum in recent months thanks to the national release of two films dramatizing the experiences of youths who went through conversion therapy \u2014 The Miseducation of Cameron Post and the higher-profile Boy Erased starring Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe.\n\nJoining 'in droves'\n\nSam Brinton of the Trevor Project, another of groups leading the ban campaign, said thousands of people have signed up to assist the effort since Boy Erased was released on Nov. 2.\n\n\n\n\"They're recognizing this is still a problem and joining our campaigns in droves,\" said Brinton, a child of Baptist missionary parents who has written about agonizing conversion therapy sessions experienced as an adolescent in Florida.\n\n\n\nBrinton recalls being bound to a table by the therapist for applications of ice, heat and electricity.\n\n\n\nJust four days after the Boy Erased release came the midterm elections, which altered the partisan political dynamic at several statehouses and boosted prospects for conversion therapy bans.\n\nIn three of the states now being targeted, previous efforts to enact a ban gained some bipartisan support but were thwarted by powerful Republicans. In Maine, a bill was vetoed last year by GOP Gov. Paul LePage. In New York and Colorado, bills approved in the Democratic-led lower chambers of the legislature died in the Republican-controlled state senates.\n\n\n\nIn January, however, a Democrat will succeed LePage as Maine's governor, and Democrats will have control of both legislative chambers in New York and in Colorado, where gay Gov.-elect Jared Polis is believed eager to sign a ban.\n\nA lead sponsor of the New York ban bill, Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman, predicted passage would be \"straightforward\" now that his party controls the Senate.\n\n\n\n\"For a lot of my colleagues, they consider conversion therapy to be child abuse,\" he said.\n\nOutlook in Massachusetts\n\n\n\nIn Massachusetts, both legislative chambers voted last year in support of a ban but were unable to reconcile different versions of the measure before adjournment. Chances of passage in 2019 are considered strong, and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who was re-elected, is viewed as likely to sign such a measure given his strong support for LGBT rights.\n\n\n\nMore Republican governors like Baker are getting behind the bans, reflecting activists' belief that opposition to conversion therapy is increasingly bipartisan.\n\n\n\nBills proposing bans are pending or anticipated in several GOP-controlled legislatures, including Florida, Ohio and Utah. LGBT activists are particularly intrigued by Utah because of the possibility that the powerful Mormon church, which in the past supported conversion therapy, might endorse a bill to ban the practice for minors.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, the proposed ban faces long odds in the legislature in 2019, but activists note that about 20 Florida cities and counties have passed local bans \u2014 more than in any other state.\n\n\n\nIn Ohio, supporters of a bill that would ban conversion therapy for minors realize they have an uphill fight in a legislature with GOP supermajorities.\n\n\n\nStill, Sen. Charleta Tavares, a Columbus Democrat, believes her proposal got \"new legs\" in November. That's when the state board overseeing counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists warned the 40,000 professionals it regulates that anyone found practicing conversion therapy on LGBT patients could lose his or her license.\n\n\n\n\"I am glad to see that our state boards are carrying this movement, regardless of the inaction by our General Assembly,\" Tavares said.\n\n\n\nFor now, LGBT activists are not seeking to ban conversion therapy for adults. A gay California legislator, Evan Low, withdrew a bill he introduced earlier this year that would have declared conversion therapy a fraudulent practice and banned commercial use of it for adults and minors. Some opponents had threatened to sue to block the bill, saying it would jeopardize free speech and free exercise of religion.\n\n\u200bModel for movie\n\n\n\nLow says he may try again after revising his bill. If so, his arguments could be bolstered by input from John Smid, the real-life model for the Boy Erased character who ran a coercive conversion therapy program.\n\n\n\nFor years, Smid was director of Tennessee-based Love in Action, a ministry that operated such a program. Smid left the organization in 2008. He subsequently renounced the concept that sexual orientation could be changed and apologized for any harm he had caused. In 2014, he married his same-sex partner, with whom he lives in Texas.\n\n\n\nSmid recently cooperated with a law firm as it compiled a report about Love in Action for the Washington-based Mattachine Society, which studies past instances of anti-LGBT persecution.\n\n\n\nOne of the report's co-authors, Lisa Linsky, said Smid depicted Love in Action as \"a complete and utter failure,\" with none of its participants actually changing sexual orientation."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Continues Wall Campaign as Shutdown Reaches Day 8", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-continues-wall-campaign-as-shutdown-reaches-day-8/4721262.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump continued Saturday to stress the need for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall as a partial government shutdown, triggered by a stalemate over funding for the project, entered its eighth day.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Trump said Democrats should take the initiative on ending the shutdown, saying, \u201cI am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal\u201d on border security.\n\nA budget standoff remains between Trump, who wants $5 billion in wall funding, and Democratic lawmakers, who back a modest increase in overall border security funding but resolutely oppose a wall.\n\n\u200bClose border, cut aid\n\nIn a series of tweets Friday, Trump again threatened to close the entire U.S.-Mexico border and cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if Congress failed to give him money to fund the wall.

The pair agreed to work toward denuclearization, ease military tensions, and improve inter-Korean relations.\n\nTheir third summit in September brought about concrete plans to promote economic ties between the two countries and reduce the chances of skirmishes.\n\nIn June Trump and Kim met in Singapore.

The Moon administration is still hopeful a visit could take place in early 2019, but no details have been made public.\n\nLikewise, Trump has indicated a willingness to meet for a second time with Kim in early 2019, but details of such a summit remain absent.\n\nCheon would like world leaders to take advantage of the \u201coptimistic moment\u201d and persuade Kim Jong Un to abandon his nuclear weapons, creating a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\n\u201cThe yardstick to use whether the past year was successful in terms of increasing peace and security on the Korean Peninsula is whether Kim Jong Un has made a full commitment [and] to give up nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, in his assessment, Kim has not made such a commitment, and Cheon predicts the current impasse with North Korea will continue for years to come, if not decades.\n\nRyu sees a number of likely scenarios taking place in the forthcoming year.\n\n\u201cI think the best scenario for everybody is [for] Kim Jong Un [to change] his mind and become serious about denuclearization,\u201d he said, \u201cIf he takes steps towards denuclearization, then South Korea, USA, along with many other countries in the international community would provide economic benefits to his government. And that\u2019s good for him.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cunless we see an entirely different North Korean society [that] have a different view about nuclear weapons \u2026 we cannot change anything,\u201d Cheon said.\n\nCheon believes the key to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is transforming North Korean society and making the population \u201cbelieve nuclear weapons are actually harmful\u201d and negatively affect their \u201cpersonal and their country\u2019s prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe noted this is not something that can be achieved quickly, but is a \u201clong-term game.\u201d\n\nIf no real progress is made on North Korean denuclearization, Ryu thinks it may be likely that more pressure may be applied to Pyongyang, and events could return to levels of tension last seen in 2017.\n\nLee Ju-hyun contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "2-Year-old Yemeni Boy Whose Mom Sued US to see Him Has Died", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/year-old-yemeni-boy-whose-mom-sued-us-to-see-him-has-died/4721102.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "The 2-year-old son of a Yemeni woman who sued the Trump administration to let her into the country to be with the ailing boy has died, the Council on American-Islamic Relations announced.\n\nAbdullah Hassan died Friday in UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland, where his father Ali Hassan brought him in the fall to get treatment for a genetic brain disorder.\n\nAli Hassan is a U.S. citizen who lives in Stockton, California.

His upcoming film, \u201cJ\u2019Accuse,\u201d about a man wrongly accused of espionage, reportedly began shooting in the fall.\n\n\u2014Sarah Ruiz-Grossman\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nR. Kelly\n\nR. Kelly has been accused dozens of times of sexual misconduct over more than two decades \u2015 including incidentsinvolving minors. In 1994, Kelly allegedly married R&B singer Aaliyah when she was 15 and he was 27. In 2008, Kelly was acquitted on child pornography charges after a video showed him allegedly having sex with and urinating on a 14-year-old girl. The artist has also agreed to multiple out-of-court settlements with women who accused him of sexual assault, including one who said Kelly had sex with her when she was 15.\n\nLast year Rolling Stone reported that radio DJ Kitti Jones, Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriend, said he abused, sexually assaulted and starved her over their two-year relationship. And a BuzzFeed report accused the singer of holding young women against their will in an abusive sex \u201ccult.\u201d\n\nSince the Me Too movement kicked off last year, and the related Time\u2019s Up initiative called for people to #MuteRKelly, the artist has had some shows canceled. Spotify also stopped promoting his music in playlists and other tools (though the artist\u2019s songs are still available on the platform). And in January, Lifetime plans to release a three-part documentary series detailing the decades of sexual abuse allegations against the singer.\n\nIn July, Kelly released a 19-minute song dismissing accusations of pedophilia and abuse against him. He\u2019s still been booking concerts, as recently as last month.\n\n\u2014Sarah Ruiz-Grossman\n\nStar Max/IPx\n\nJames Franco\n\nJames Franco was one of the men accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the Me Too movement, but his alleged creepiness has been well-documented for years.\n\nRemember the time the then-35-year-old actor was caught flirting with a 17-year-old fan on Instagram? That was in 2014. And remember when actress Busy Philipps told Bravo host Andy Cohen in 2016 about the time Franco threw her to the ground on the set of \u201cFreaks and Geeks\u201d in the late \u201990s?\n\n\n\nSo when, earlier this year, actress Violet Paley tweeted that Franco once attempted to force her to perform oral sex and actress Sarah Tither-Kaplan said Franco had the \u201cexploitative\u201d practice of encouraging women to perform fully nude and five other women spoke out in an explosive Los Angeles Times article accusing him of sexual misconduct, was it really all that surprising?\n\nDespite all this, the actor has at least three films coming out next year, according to IMDb. He also received widespread accolades for directing and starring in \u201cThe Disaster Artist.\u201d Just two weeks after the LA Times story broke, he won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.\n\n\u2014Antonia Blumberg\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nBrett Kavanaugh\n\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct by at least three women and went on to gain access to one of the most powerful jobs in the country in spite of the allegations.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University, alleged Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, pushed her into a bedroom and sexually assaulted her during a party when they were high schoolers in Maryland. Deborah Ramirez, who studied with Kavanaugh at Yale University, accused him of exposing his genitals to her at a party. Julie Swetnick claimed she saw Kavanaugh participate in sexual misconduct at numerous house parties when they were both in high school.\n\nKavanaugh has denied all the allegations. The judge lashed out at his accusers, Democrats and the media in an aggressive and emotional testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of his confirmation. The display prompted 83 ethics complaints, all of which have been dropped. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court, and he\u2019s back to coaching youth basketball.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ford continues to receive death threats for accusing Kavanaugh.\n\n\u2014Antonia Blumberg\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nDonald Trump\n\nMore than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct and he was famously caught on tape bragging about groping women.\n\nHe was elected president."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Lies Again About 19,000 'Deleted' FBI Text Messages", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lies-again-about-19000-deleted-text-messages_us_5c27d954e4b05c88b700ef50", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "Strzok was fired in August for derogatory comments about Trump he sent to Page, who resigned in May.\n\nMore than 19,000 texts were found to be missing during the investigation into the communication between the two.

It was ultimately made possible by Congress, which never passed a pay hike before the end of the year. The GOP-controlled Senate had signed off on a bipartisan 1.9 percent increase, but the GOP-controlled House left it unaddressed.\n\nIf Trump had done nothing, the federal pay formula would have enacted an automatic 2.1 percent pay increase. But the inaction by Congress gave him an opening to make the increase zero through executive order.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the House will agree to a pay raise after Democrats take over as the majority on Jan. 3. Federal employee unions will press for any raise to be retroactive to the first of the year if an increase gets passed.\n\nGroups representing federal employees said Trump\u2019s freeze comes as added insult to the shutdown. Roughly one-fourth of the federal government is not funded at the moment, as the president demands $5 billion in federal funds for a wall along the southern border that he used to say Mexico was going to pay for.\n\nRoughly 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed and are temporarily out of a job. Although lawmakers have typically approved backpay retroactively after previous shutdowns, there is no guarantee a divided Congress would do so this time.\n\nNARFE, a group representing current and retired federal workers, said the implementation of the pay freeze is another sign of Trump\u2019s \u201cdisdain\u201d for government employees.\n\n\u201cRefusing to provide a nominal raise for our nation\u2019s hardworking federal employees amid a partial government shutdown shows clear contempt for those who carry out public service,\u201d Ken Thomas, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\nTony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers, said Trump was \u201cpouring salt into the wound\u201d while workers go without paychecks.\n\nAs HuffPost reported Thursday, the partial shutdown is just the latest chapter in Trump\u2019s long-running battle with civil servants who do the government\u2019s work. In addition to the pay freeze, his administration has also tried to peel back collective bargaining rights and increase workers\u2019 pension contributions.\n\nMany workers and their representatives bristle at middle-class government employees being lumped in with the \u201cswamp\u201d that Trump said needs draining.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if we have an administration that is at war with its own workforce,\u201d one union official told HuffPost earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s been an ongoing assault.\u201d\n\nTrump has warned that the shutdown could drag on \u201dfor a very long time\u2033 if he doesn\u2019t get the wall money he wants. Democrats have said they will produce a bill to reopen the government as soon as they take over the House next week, but so far they have shown few signs of acquiescing to the president\u2019s demands.\n\nMembers of the military are not subject to the pay freeze. They will be receiving a 2.6 percent pay increase next year, even though Trump falsely told them to their faces that they would be getting 10 percent."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "The Real Reason Why Some Bernie Sanders Fans Have It In For Beto O\u2019Rourke", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-beto-orourke-presidential-primary-feud-former-staff_us_5c27d084e4b08aaf7a91035a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS/Eric Gay, File Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas), the 2018 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Texas, makes his concession speech at his election night party in El Paso, Texas.\n\nThe progressive commentariat has been buzzing in recent weeks about the barrage of unflattering reporting and criticism directed at retiring Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) by left-leaning journalists and activists.\n\nAlthough Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 team insists he has had nothing to do with the criticism and there is no evidence to suggest he has, many of his supporters have indeed been peeved by the boomlet of hype around O\u2019Rourke following his 3-percentage-point loss in the race for a Senate seat in Texas.\n\nBut there is a specific factor driving the frustration of some diehard \u201cBerniecrats\u201d that has thus far received little attention: The defection of key alumni from Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential run to the O\u2019Rourke camp and the resulting worry that they will provide a progressive coat of paint for the Texan\u2019s more moderate record.\n\nBecky Bond and Zack Malitz are two of those figures. The pair had a major role in shaping Sanders\u2019 innovative \u201cdistributed\u201d organizing model that the candidate used to empower decentralized, self-organizing groups of volunteers in lieu of a much larger, more expensive cohort of field staff. They masterminded a similar setup for O\u2019Rourke in his 2018 Senate run.\n\nBond and Malitz have already pledged themselves to O\u2019Rourke if he jumps into the presidential race.\n\n\u201cThey are using their Bernie credibility to whitewash Beto\u2019s policies,\u201d said a progressive strategist sympathetic to Sanders who declined to be named for professional reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s Bernie-washing.\u201d\n\nAs for those policies, progressive critics point to a number of examples. O\u2019Rourke, a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, has voted for bills lifting the ban on exporting crude oil and granting presidents a fast-track approval process for international trade agreements. Over three terms in Congress he also failed to sign on to a single-payer health care bill that had the support of the majority of House Democrats, though as a Senate candidate he said that if elected, he would support Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill.\n\nBond and Malitz aren\u2019t the only Sanders alumni likely to bolt for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team if he runs.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also tapped Middle Seat, a digital strategy and fundraising firm founded by Sanders alumni Kenneth Pennington, Hector Sigala and Elizabeth Bennett, to run the digital operation for his Senate campaign. And Linh Nguyen, another former Sanders digital staffer, migrated to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign as well.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Middle Seat is \u201choping\u201d to join a potential O\u2019Rourke 2020 bid as well; Pennington declined to comment in response to a HuffPost inquiry.\n\nSanders\u2019 most ardent supporters say they are not worried that O\u2019Rourke will deprive Sanders of top organizing firepower or signal an exodus of former Sanders talent to the O\u2019Rourke team in the event that both men run for president.\n\nTim Tagaris and Robin Curran, who led Sanders\u2019 digital fundraising team, have already pledged to return to the Sanders fold, according to the Sanders campaign. And Pennington had a public falling out with Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 longtime adviser and 2016 campaign manager, in August 2016, long before O\u2019Rourke became a nationally recognized figure.\n\nSanders\u2019 midterm campaign swing showed there \u201cis a tremendous outpouring of support [for him] that still exists at the grassroots level,\u201d Weaver told HuffPost. \u201cI have an email inbox and voicemail full of messages from former staffers who want to rejoin a campaign if it happens.\u201d\n\nWeaver would not comment on O\u2019Rourke or any other potential candidates.\n\nBut some Sanders loyalists nonetheless fear that the presence of some high-profile Sanders alumni closely associated with Sanders\u2019 most successful tactics will obscure O\u2019Rourke\u2019s centrist policy record.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying O\u2019Rourke is a bridge to the Bernie wing because of Zack and Becky,\u201d the progressive strategist said.\n\nEven if Bond, Malitz and other Sanders alumni have not magnified O\u2019Rourke\u2019s notoriety by association, they certainly have done so by leveraging the Sanders playbook to help O\u2019Rourke succeed, according to Charles Lenchner, a co-founder of The People for Bernie Sanders, a pro-Sanders group with a big social media following that is not tied to the campaign.\n\nThe use of campaign tactics and the enthusiasm they generate among the grassroots is effectively used as a substitute for policy. Charles Lenchner, the People for Bernie Sanders\n\nNow Lenchner and others worry that establishment Democrats like Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden and former Obama adviser David Axelrod are excited about O\u2019Rourke precisely because he provides an opportunity to tap into the youth vote that Sanders excited without Sanders\u2019 left-wing policies. These Sanders acolytes see a precedent for it in the way that former President Barack Obama\u2019s dynamic organizing style obscured a more centrist governing record.\n\n\u201cThe use of campaign tactics and the enthusiasm they generate among the grassroots is effectively used as a substitute for policy,\u201d said Lenchner, who is now digital director of the left-wing news outlet The Real News.\n\nMurshed Zaheed, who worked with Bond and Malitz at the progressive cellphone company Credo Action and emphasized his deep admiration for Bond, nonetheless shared Lenchner\u2019s concern.\n\nO\u2019Rourke \u201cwants to take the tactical underpinnings of the Bernie campaign and put his polish on it, but not necessarily in a way that is progressive on policy,\u201d said Zaheed, who is now a principal at the left-leaning consulting shop Strategy and Hustle, and has not yet settled on a candidate in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cGrassroots organizing does not make a candidate progressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that Becky [Bond] and Zack [Malitz] found Barack Obama\u2019s presidency to be disappointing. So it doesn\u2019t add up then,\u201d said Anthony Rogers-Wright, an African-American climate justice activist and former member of Sanders\u2019 policy team.\n\nReferring to Rules for Revolutionaries, Bond\u2019s 2016 book with fellow Sanders alum Zack Exley, Rodgers-Wright quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s not Beto. I could see that book being more applicable to [former Florida gubernatorial candidate] Andrew Gillum than Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in some ways, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s record is more conservative than Obama\u2019s. As journalist David Sirota, who briefly worked for Sanders in the early 2000s, noted in his exhaustive analysis of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s legislative history, the El Paso congressman voted for bills undermining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the creation of which Obama oversaw.\n\nStill, Bond, Malitz and the other Sanders alumni drifting toward O\u2019Rourke have their defenders within Bernie World. Shaun King, a black civil rights activist who was a top surrogate for Sanders in 2016, joined Bond in co-founding the Real Justice PAC, a group dedicated to electing more progressive prosecutors, in February. He said his friendship with Bond and Malitz contributes to his confidence in O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cThey grew to believe in Beto like I think they grew to believe in Bernie. It\u2019s real,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cThey would have no interest in putting progressive clothes on Beto,\u201d he added. \u201cThey believe he is a deeply progressive person and will be a deeply progressive leader.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/J. Scott Applewhite Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), joined at left by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), holds a news conference after the Senate passed a resolution pulling aid from the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nAsked to respond to some of the criticism herself, Bond sent HuffPost the unabridged text of a statement she previously provided to The New York Times explaining her support for a would-be O\u2019Rourke presidential run. In it, Bond emphasized O\u2019Rourke\u2019s freewheeling campaign style and commitment to reaching voters in person.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other 2020 contender who has had the sheer number of conversations with voters as Beto has over the past two years,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also stressed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s strengths as an advocate for immigration reform and racial justice. (The most viral moments of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign featured him eloquently denouncing police killings of unarmed black men and the right of football players like Colin Kaepernick to protest those killings.)\n\n\u201cWhat other potential candidate has addressed the refugee and immigration crisis as boldly or compellingly as Beto has?\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd this country needs a leader with the moral clarity on racial justice that Beto demonstrated again and again on the campaign trail in Texas.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s precisely because turning out voters of color, and championing issues that affect them directly, is such a high priority for any Democratic candidate that some Democrats outside of Sanders\u2019 camp question whether O\u2019Rourke, a white man, is really the right choice in a field that is likely to include several nonwhite contenders.\n\nSteve Phillips, a prominent Democratic donor who started a super PAC in support of a likely presidential run by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, believes Booker is best poised to \u201crebuild the Obama coalition\u201d of voters of color and white progressives.\n\nPhillips has encouraged O\u2019Rourke, Gillum and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams \u2015 all of whom lost by narrow margins \u2015 to run again for statewide office rather than jumping in the presidential pool.\n\nStill, he wonders why O\u2019Rourke\u2019s impressive but ultimately failed Senate bid has generated more presidential buzz than the gubernatorial runs of Gillum and Abrams, both of whom are black and lost by fewer percentage points than O\u2019Rourke did."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Ocasio-Cortez Says Claire McCaskill Calling Her A 'Shiny Object' To CNN Is 'Disappointing'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-claire-mccaskill-shiny-object_us_5c27f909e4b05c88b700f9da", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has responded to a CNN report that outgoing Sen.

Wade.\n\nEvery year, anti-abortion legislators and legislatures chip away at reproductive rights, and 2018 brought a wave of extreme restrictions from lawmakers determined to topple Roe v. Wade. This year, as of Dec. 11, 22 abortion restrictions were passed nationwide \u2014 a number that will likely edge up to 24 by the time 2019 begins.\n\nOn the surface, that number looks pretty good. It\u2019s the fewest abortion restrictions passed in a single year in more than a decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and promotes reproductive health policy. And for the first time in recent years, the number of proactive reproductive health policies \u2014 measures that make it easier for women to access abortion services and birth control, for example \u2014 outpaced the number of restrictions.\n\nAnd yet ... the laws that legislators pushed through in 2018 and the rhetoric they used were extreme and aggressive in ways that deeply unsettled reproductive rights advocates, said Elizabeth Nash, the senior state issues manager at Guttmacher, particularly given the Supreme Court\u2019s new conservative majority. Furthermore, new laws don\u2019t tell the full picture as some states tried to resurrect old anti-abortion legislation with that new conservative majority mind.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw this year was a lower number of enacted restrictions,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBut some of these are so extreme that it\u2019s a shift in the type of restrictions we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s not captured in the pure number.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how anti-abortion legislators targeted abortion access in 2018.\n\nThey instituted restrictions that make it really hard \u2014 often impossible \u2014 for women to get abortions within a legal time frame\n\nThe most extreme abortion restriction of 2018 came out of Iowa, which banned abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 at around six weeks gestation \u2014 except in cases of rape or incest or if the woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nSix weeks is so early in a pregnancy that a woman might not know she\u2019s pregnant yet; the law bans abortion before many women even realize they\u2019ve missed a period. And even if they know they\u2019re pregnant before six weeks, it leaves virtually no time for them to find an abortion provider, book an appointment, come up with the money they need and tackle any of the many other logistical hurdles women must contend with.\n\nCutting off access to abortion at a certain point in pregnancy is nothing new, Nash said, but the drive to do it earlier and earlier is a shift toward the extreme. In past years, states focused on banning abortions at 20 weeks gestation, or about the halfway point in a woman\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 not in the first few weeks.\n\nThat Iowa law is tied up in the courts, meaning it is not in effect, but Ohio came close to enacting a similar bill, which Gov. John Kasich vetoed just before Christmas. Likewise, Mississippi is one of two states that passed a ban on most abortions after the 15-week mark. It too has been blocked by the courts, but the state\u2019s attorney general has said he will appeal.\n\n\u201cIn some states that already have so many restrictions on the books, all that is left is to ban abortion,\u201d Nash argued. \u201cThey\u2019ve restricted access to the extent that\u2019s possible, so now the next big leap is an early abortion ban.\u201d\n\nThey played on concerns about discrimination in order to stigmatize women who seek abortions\n\nIn the fall, Indiana\u2019s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to overrule two previous court decisions blocking a 2016 state law that, among other things, barred women from getting an abortion based on the race or gender of a fetus or in cases in which a fetus has a disability.\n\nThat sort of legislation falls under the broad umbrella of what Nash called \u201creason bans,\u201d which prohibit women from terminating a pregnancy based on things like sex or race. Anti-abortion legislators argue they\u2019re solely meant to prohibit discrimination, but reproductive rights advocates call BS. They say they\u2019re nothing more than an effort to further limit abortion access while fueling stigma by legally requiring doctors to question their patients\u2019 motives.\n\nLast year Ohio\u2019s governor signed a similar bill that would make it a felony for doctors to perform an abortion for any woman whose fetus has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. Some parents of children with Down syndrome have supported the measure, while others have criticized what they see as a bad faith effort from anti-abortion lawmakers. For now, it too is tied up in court.\n\n\u201cIf [legislators] really cared about making the community better for my daughter, they\u2019d provide more funding for programs that help her. They\u2019d help improve inclusion in schools. They\u2019d help educate parents that Down syndrome doesn\u2019t have to be scary,\u201d one woman told HuffPost last March. \u201cI have a whole bunch of issues I would love to have legislators\u2019 help with.\u201d\n\nThey used gruesome, imprecise language to paint a safe and common method of abortion as cruel and barbaric\n\nBans on dilation and evacuation procedures, one of the most common ways doctors perform second-trimester abortions, gained traction once again in 2018. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said D&Es, as they\u2019re often called, are a safe way to remove the contents of the uterus and can be done as an outpatient surgery with general or regional anesthesia \u2014 but legislators have used inflammatory language painting it as a barbarous act.\n\nFor example, in Kentucky, which passed a 2018 ban on D&E abortions, a bill didn\u2019t say \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d anywhere. Instead, it banned procedures that cause \u201cbodily dismemberment,\u201d \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201chuman vivisection.\u201d And that rhetoric, Nash said, represents a real shift.\n\n\u201cThe language isn\u2019t about protecting health or fetal rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe language is simply trying to paint the procedure as something dangerous, something terrible that no one would ever want to undergo. And oh, by the way, it would make it very hard if not impossible to access abortion after 15 weeks, so that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nThey wrote laws they knew would be challenged in court in a big and public way, with the goal of toppling Roe v. Wade\n\nFor Nash, perhaps the most worrisome shift of 2018 was the ramping up of likely unconstitutional legislation aimed at drawing lawsuits, with the hope those cases will eventually land in front of the Supreme Court and test Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said while campaigning for the presidency that he believed the landmark decision would be overturned \u201cautomatically\u201d because it was his intention to put several conservative judges on the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on abortion rights, retired in June, and now two of Trump\u2019s appointees sit on the court.\n\n\u201cYou have states across the country that are essentially lining up with prefiled abortion bans,\u201d Nash said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Trauma Is The Norm For Many New Orleans Kids.

Their creations line the walls of the art and electives room. In the adjacent hallway, bright blue plywood covers the spots where students punched or kicked holes in the drywall as they passed between classes.\n\nThis is the middle school campus for the New Orleans Center for Resilience, a nonprofit K\u20138 school with two locations in the city. The 27 kids enrolled in the center\u2019s program have some of the most extreme behavior needs in the city, often stemming from trauma or mental illness. A typical student may have exhibited verbal and physical aggression, caused property damage or refused to do classwork. It\u2019s a place for kids who have almost nowhere else to turn \u2014 when they\u2019ve been asked or told to leave their previous schools.\n\n\u201cA lot of the kids who are referred here have experienced significant complex trauma,\u201d said Liz Marcell Williams, the center\u2019s director. \u201cWhether they themselves have been victims of trauma or they\u2019re exposed to violence in the home or in the community or have experienced significant loss of a loved one due to long-term incarceration or death.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans, a high-poverty, high-crime city, has particularly pressing needs when it comes to trauma and behavioral health.\n\nA survey of about 1,200 New Orleans kids ages 10 to 16, released in 2015, found that nearly 40 percent had witnessed domestic violence, a shooting, a stabbing or a beating. About 18 percent reported witnessing a murder. And more than half said that someone close to them had been murdered.\n\nThe survey found that children in New Orleans displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at more than three times the national average.\n\nThe center, which was known as the Therapeutic Day Program until Dec. 1, is a rare lifeline to the few who get in. When it opened in 2015, it was the first school of its kind in New Orleans, offering a blend of traditional classes like math and English, as well as therapy and counseling. In a city where student mental health resources remain scant, there are few places like it today.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Misty Johnson does a warm-up activity with Jordan Coughlin, a math teacher at the Center for Resilience.\n\nKids who arrive at the center are usually three grade levels behind in math and reading, said Williams, who has a background in special education and designed the school\u2019s curriculum. Her goal is to get kids back into the mainstream school system. Students attend the center for an average of 15 months.\n\nNine-year-old Misty Johnson, who has ADHD and bipolar disorder, has been in the program for two years. Her mom, Dawn Johnson, said Misty is almost ready to return to a charter elementary school.\n\nJohnson admitted that she was worried when she first visited the center. \u201cThe other kids were just like Misty,\u201d she said, adding that she thought it might be overwhelming for her daughter.\n\nOver time, however, she saw improvements in Misty\u2019s behavior and academics. Many of the classes here are tiny; some have just two students. Misty was getting lots of one-on-one attention. The school called Johnson regularly to give updates.\n\nThis year the center started assigning students a home base room, where they begin their day with breakfast. The home base is meant to be a safe room, and students may return there during the day if they need to opt out of a class or activity. In a typical school, students don\u2019t usually have the option to walk out of class if they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Abel Thompson, a second-grader, displays his newly crafted Santa Claus beard. In addition to academic offerings, various activities \u2014 from sports to play to art \u2014 are integrated into a school day at the Center for Resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always thinking about how do we minimize power struggles,\u201d Williams said. The home base room really helped them with that, she added. From August to November last year, the center had 235 behavioral incidents requiring an adult crisis response, she said. This year in the same time frame, there were 77. The home base rooms were partly responsible for that, she said.\n\nDespite the high rate of turnover at the center, most kids who apply for a spot at the tiny school never get in.\n\nOnly 45 kids have attended since the school opened. Erin LaFleur wanted her 14-year-old son, Brady, to be one of them. He has bipolar disorder, autism and Down syndrome and spent time in a state-run facility that was several hours away by car. She fought long and hard to navigate the New Orleans public school system for him, and she said she thought the center\u2019s day program would be a perfect fit.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t get in.\n\nHe lacked the verbal communication and social skills necessary for the program, a rejection letter stated.\n\n\u201cIt would benefit children with intellectual disabilities who have behavior disorders if [the center] accepted them,\u201d LaFleur said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "He Hawks Young Blood As A New Miracle Treatment.

Teen donors, vampiric undertones, a serious-sounding study, an $8,000-per-person price tag and rumors that venture capitalist Peter Thiel might be interested earned Ambrosia more than 100 press mentions in just two years.\n\nThe effects of young plasma, Karmazin told reporters, were astounding. Just one infusion \u201cdramatically improves people\u2019s appearance, their memory and their strength,\u201d he told one reporter. \u201cI want to be clear, at this point, it works. It reverses aging,\u201d he told another. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality but I think it comes pretty close,\u201d he told a third, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like plastic surgery from the inside out.\u201d\n\nThe free publicity helped Ambrosia attract clients: One hundred and four people paid to receive plasma from 16- to 25-year-old donors as part of Ambrosia\u2019s participant-funded study, Karmazin told HuffPost.\n\nBut despite declaring the study a success and announcing plans this week to accept new clients, Karmazin never showed any proof that the transfusions actually helped people. In the media, he touted impressive results, but almost a year after his study officially concluded in January 2018, he hasn\u2019t released them. Scientists have criticized the study as flawed and the procedure as medically unnecessary and not without risk; in rare cases, transfusion complications can be fatal. One of the doctors Karmazin hired had previously been disciplined by a state medical board for unprofessional conduct. Karmazin himself cannot legally practice medicine in any state; he is explicitly prohibited from practicing in Massachusetts by authorities. Ambrosia\u2019s president and chief operating officer quietly left the company in late December, leaving Karmazin as the sole employee. And the only patient who spoke publicly about Ambrosia\u2019s transfusions \u2014 treatments he hoped would help him live healthier into old age \u2014 died at 65 after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nKarmazin couldn\u2019t comment on individual patients but said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment.\n\n[People] could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment. Phuoc Le, physician and global health specialist\n\nHuffPost found that at least some of Karmazin\u2019s young plasma came from a nonprofit blood bank in Texas that recruited teenage donors for \u201csaving lives,\u201d but noted on a consent form that their blood components could also be used for \u201cany other medical purpose.\u201d\n\nThe bank abruptly decided to stop selling young plasma after HuffPost reached out, according to an employee email.\n\nAmbrosia, which declined to comment on whether the company has any investors, is only one of many firms investigating how to help people feel younger for longer. But Ambrosia\u2019s ability to attract paying clients and years of positive press coverage \u2014 without providing scientific data to back up its claims \u2014 shows just how easy it can be for promises to outpace the research when Silicon Valley gold-chasing mixes with Americans\u2019 fear of death.\n\n\u201cYou can easily imagine a situation where somebody who\u2019s vulnerable, and not wealthy, and not healthy, and may be desperate ... would potentially feel like they have no option but to spend this money,\u201d said Phuoc Le, a physician and global health specialist who teaches at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThey could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctor Karmazin\n\nKarmazin was born in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and attended Princeton University, where he became a highly accomplished rower, going on to win a silver medal in the Paralympic Games in Beijing in 2008. He attended Stanford Medical School and participated in labs that focused on longevity and stem cell biology. His experience as an athlete \u2014 and feeling slower athletically after turning 30 \u2014 influenced his desire to work on aging as a treatable condition. After graduating in 2014, Karmazin started a residency at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston with a plan to eventually specialize in psychiatry. But as Karmazin tells it, he didn\u2019t like working the long hours and felt he didn\u2019t have time to pursue his other interests, transfusions and aging, in addition to general practice, so he left his residency in 2016 to start Ambrosia.\n\nThere is an asterisk to that story: On Feb. 29, 2016, Karmazin and his attorney signed a voluntary agreement with Massachusetts officials in which he promised to immediately stop practicing medicine in the state. Karmazin told HuffPost he signed the paperwork because he left his residency early, that doing so was \u201cpretty routine,\u201d there were no additional circumstances that he was aware of and that\u2019s all he knew. That account seems unlikely. Karmazin was practicing under a limited license; such a license terminates automatically if a physician leaves a residency program early for any reason, according to George Zachos, the executive director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine. The board wouldn\u2019t typically pursue such an agreement with a limited licensee for leaving a residency early, Zachos said. Such a public agreement is used to protect patient safety. Last year, only 12 physicians in Massachusetts reached similar deals.\n\nThe board\u2019s review is confidential, but a representative noted the circumstances that led to the agreement were unrelated to Karmazin\u2019s work with Ambrosia or xVitality Sciences, a separate \u201crejuvenation\u201d project he also worked on.\n\nKarmazin, who introduces himself as \u201cDr. Karmazin,\u201d moved forward with Ambrosia after signing that agreement. He said he got the idea for young plasma transfusions from several studies in which young and old mice were surgically conjoined in order to examine the effects of mixing their blood. In some cases, the older mice became temporarily stronger and showed slight improvements to their health. Karmazin believed those results could be replicated in humans.\n\nMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood, but there is no scientific evidence for that. Irina Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nScientists have questioned Karmazin\u2019s interpretation of the data. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who led conjoined-mice tests noticed small positive changes in older animals\u2019 muscles, livers and brains. But the more important finding was the significant decline in the health of the younger animals. For the older animals, the young blood was largely diluted by the old blood.\n\n\u201cThere was much more negative effect from the stuff in the old blood than there was positive effect from the stuff in the young blood,\u201d said Irina Conboy, an aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley, who compared young blood transfusions to taking \u201ca pile of rotten bananas\u201d and throwing \u201cone good one\u201d on top. \u201cMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is no scientific evidence for that.\u201d\n\nKarmazin went ahead anyway: In the summer of 2016, he announced that he would charge people ages 35 and older $8,000 each for about 2 liters of young plasma as part of what he called a \u201cclinical trial.\u201d Karmazin didn\u2019t feel the need to go through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug approval process, as plasma transfusions are already a well-established procedure. Most of the time, however, they are used to treat patients who have specific health issues, not carried out to potentially make people feel younger.\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial whipped up the flurry of press coverage that doubled as free advertising, and in some cases, suggested inaccurately that people were drinking young blood. But what really got people talking about Ambrosia was a report that Peter Thiel, the tech entrepreneur billionaire, was interested in young blood. Karmazin himself appears to have made the explicit connection to Ambrosia. In 2016, he told an Inc. magazine reporter that Jason Camm, chief medical officer at Thiel Capital, had contacted him to express interest in Ambrosia. It\u2019s not clear whether Camm was reaching out on Thiel\u2019s behalf, or how extensive the alleged contact was. But the story prompted a wave of Thiel-vampire insinuations in the media. Later, in an interview with TechCrunch, Karmazin completely denied having contact with anyone from Thiel Capital, raising questions about who wanted to quash the story.\n\nCamm and Thiel Capital did not respond to requests for comment. In November, Thiel said at the New York Times DealBook conference: \u201cOn the record. I\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d He also said he\u2019s never injected himself with young blood. Karmazin reiterated to HuffPost that he\u2019s not in any contact with Thiel. When asked why his story appears to have changed, Karmazin repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nSweet Little 16-Year-Old Plasma\n\nTo launch his study, Karmazin needed plasma, the liquid part of blood, from young people. He needed a lot of it \u2014 Ambrosia performed more than 150 roughly 2-liter transfusions (some clients reportedly returned for multiple treatments), according to Karmazin, which would have required at least 80 gallons of young plasma, hundreds of donations\u2019 worth. But he faced a hitch: Blood banks don\u2019t typically separate out blood plasma by age and sell it for rejuvenation purposes; their primary mission is to provide donated blood for hospital patients and save lives.\n\nWhen blood centers have unused plasma, they commonly provide it to different companies in order to make products to treat serious medical conditions such as hemophilia, according to a spokesperson for AABB, a nonprofit that accredits blood centers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to find a blood bank willing to supply a startup for Karmazin\u2019s purposes. In the beginning, Karmazin called some 20 blood banks, he said. It \u201ctook a while to find the right partner,\u201d he added. There was interest, he claimed, but banks didn\u2019t have a process in place to get him the plasma he needed. HuffPost contacted more than a dozen U.S. blood banks, many of which cited ethical concerns and raised questions about Ambrosia\u2019s study. The chief medical and scientific officer of Vitalant, a nonprofit that distributes blood to more than 1,000 U.S. hospitals, told HuffPost that Vitalant leadership contacted all its donation centers after hearing about Ambrosia to confirm none worked with the company. Ambrosia\u2019s study didn\u2019t seem to be a legitimate clinical trial, Dr. Ralph Vassallo said, so Vitalant shouldn\u2019t be selling to the startup.\n\nEventually, Karmazin said, he found two blood banks to provide the company with \u201cexcess\u201d young plasma that he could use for his study. Karmazin refused to say which ones they were.\n\nEmmanuel Polanco for HuffPost\n\nDeep In The Heart Of Texas\n\nOne of his partners for Ambrosia\u2019s trial was the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a subsidiary of BioBridge Global, a nonprofit headquartered in San Antonio.\n\nSTBTC has lamented \u201ccritical\u201d blood supply shortages and called on millennials to \u201cstep up and donate.\u201d It has sent blood collection buses to schools and asks students on its website: \u201cAre you up for saving lives?\u201d It holds a donation competition for local high schools called \u201cGeneration Give\u201d with $750 top prizes, and has offered incentives to donors such as free movie tickets and amusement park passes. Students who have donated six blood products or more \u201chave made the difference in the lives of over 18 hospital patients,\u201d STBTC states on its website. Honored students receive a special red cord to wear at their high school graduation ceremony.\n\nThe South Texas blood bank\u2019s main mission is to provide blood to approximately 100 hospitals and clinics, Elizabeth Waltman, STBTC\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. But \u201cafter community needs are met, and to ensure no donated blood is wasted, we provide blood where it is needed, including to support research that will advance medical care,\u201d she added. Ambrosia\u2019s study met STBTC\u2019s requirements for research-related use of their blood components, she said.\n\nSTBTC did not comment on whether it sold donations that came through Generation Give as young plasma. But its consent forms for blood donors \u201cclearly state\u201d that donations will be used to serve \u201cboth clinical and research purposes,\u201d Waltman said. HuffPost reviewed a copy of STBTC\u2019s 1,200-word student consent form, which requires kids and parents to acknowledge that donated blood may be used to help patients \u201cor for any other medical purpose.\u201d The form praises students for \u201cgiving the gift of life.\u201d\n\nThe Trial\n\nBy the fall of 2016, Karmazin was ready to launch his study.\n\nAmbrosia told trial participants that \u201cabundant data\u201d from mice studies suggested young plasma infusions could help with \u201crejuvenation,\u201d but the company said it couldn\u2019t guarantee participants any specific results, such as the treatment of a disease. Rather, it noted in its informed consent form that there are \u201cno known improvements\u201d directly related to young plasma infusions. In fact, the form contained \u201can appalling lack of detailed explanation of what the actual effects of this intervention are supposed to be,\u201d said Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who reviewed Ambrosia\u2019s form at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\nKarmazin contracted physicians to carry out the young plasma transfusions at clinics in San Francisco; Monterey, California; and Tampa, Florida. The Monterey-based doctor, David Wright, had been publicly reprimanded by the Medical Board of California in 2015 for charges that included gross negligence related to diagnosing a patient with a chronic tick-borne infection without an adequate basis, and then using a medically unsupported treatment \u2015 daily antibiotic infusion therapy \u2015 that led to significant side effects. Wright did not admit to wrongdoing in the agreement; the reprimand did not preclude him from practicing medicine.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said one director of transfusion medicine. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm.\u201d\n\nThen-New Scientist writer Sally Adee traveled to Monterey to cover Ambrosia\u2019s trial in 2017 and reported that a patient who came from Russia had an anaphylactic reaction after a transfusion. Wright was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d after the incident, Adee wrote.\n\nAmbrosia ultimately reported four adverse incidents during the trial, according to Barbara Krutchkoff, the executive director of the Institute of Regenerative and Cellular Medicine, a small nonprofit that houses an institutional review board that oversaw the study. They included a rash in March 2017, a runny nose and cold symptoms in April, hives and edema in June, and itchiness in December. All were considered mild allergic reactions and resolved, she said.\n\nAmbrosia was fortunate there weren\u2019t more adverse reactions, said Le, the physician and global health specialist.\n\n\u201cIn general, somebody who does not need a blood transfusion would be at great risk for all sorts of things, short term and long term,\u201d said Le, who was alarmed that Ambrosia claimed to give patients about 2 liters of plasma over just one to two days.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said Robertson Davenport, director of transfusion medicine at the University of Michigan. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the study, Karmazin and Wright had a falling-out. They disagreed over Karmazin\u2019s plans to transfuse smaller amounts of young plasma over a shorter period of time \u2014 a change Wright deemed risky, according to the New Scientist article. \u201cWe just had different ideas for what this treatment could become,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. Wright stopped working for Ambrosia before the study was complete.\n\nWright did not respond to several calls and emailed requests for comment. When HuffPost sent a reporter to his new office in Pacific Grove, his receptionist threatened to call the police.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s Still No Data\u2019\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial formally ended in January 2018. It was a great success, according to Karmazin, with about one-third of the participants returning to purchase additional treatments and around 150 treatments delivered in all. Some people continued to receive transfusions as late as this past summer, he said.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Ambrosia had been touting findings for months. Karmazin claimed to Canada\u2019s National Post, for example, that an early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patient showed improvements with one treatment and a person in their 60s saw their graying hair turn darker. He told New Scientist that he saw a 10 percent decrease in patients\u2019 blood cholesterol levels, and told Boss Magazine there were \u201creally dramatic improvements\u201d to biomarkers for inflammation.\n\n[Ambrosia] seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money. Michael Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nThe company said it tested patients\u2019 blood for more than 100 biomarkers before and after the transfusions, looking for improvements in markers for aging and disease. Ambrosia\u2019s study did not have a control group that received a placebo. And a change in a biomarker isn\u2019t necessarily proof of a change in actual health status, noted Charo, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor. Such changes must be matched to \u201creal health outcomes,\u201d which requires long-term follow-up. Karmazin said patients wrote diaries, and that some later volunteered additional health data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how Ambrosia\u2019s was set up as a clinical trial,\u201d said Michael Conboy, husband and research partner of Irina Conboy, the aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley. \u201cIt seemed to me that it was set up as more of a \u2018fee for service\u2019 type thing and the \u2018trial\u2019 part was slapped on to legitimize it. It seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still no public data. Karmazin shared some \u201cpreliminary results that he was excited about\u201d with his hired institutional review board, Krutchkoff said, but she hadn\u2019t seen the final results. Speaking to HuffPost with Karmazin\u2019s permission, Krutchkoff praised Karmazin\u2019s professionalism and brushed off criticisms of the study. \u201cAs controversial as this study was, there\u2019s a lot worse being done,\u201d she said.\n\nHoward Chipman, the doctor Ambrosia hired in Tampa, also said he hadn\u2019t seen the results. HuffPost could not find a participant who had.\n\nTom Casey, the CEO of NuPlasma, a company that sells young plasma to physicians in Texas \u2015 and is supplying another young plasma study in Houston \u2014 urged Karmazin to release the data. \u201cThe people who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you called this a trial and said you were collecting data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still no data.\u201d\n\nResults Not Guaranteed\n\nKarmazin and David Cavalier, Ambrosia\u2019s then-president and chief operating officer, said earlier this past fall that they had to be careful not to make any guarantees about the effects of Ambrosia\u2019s treatment. Companies generally need to get approval from the FDA before they can claim that a drug or medical product treats, cures or prevents a disease. Cavalier noted that Ambrosia transfused a Parkinson\u2019s patient who reported an improvement in a tremor, a patient with depleted testosterone levels who was soon \u201cenjoying morning erections again,\u201d and people who reported improvements with arthritis symptoms, sleep, memory and energy levels.\n\nSome of Ambrosia\u2019s claims to the media have been \u201cmaybe a little bit exuberant\u201d but still \u201c100 percent accurate,\u201d Karmazin said.\n\nKarmazin told HuffPost in the fall he temporarily paused transfusions to focus on opening a clinic in New York City by early 2019. Ambrosia is required to obtain a permit to transfuse a blood component in New York, but as of mid-December, the company had not applied for one, according to a New York State Department of Health spokesperson.\n\nHe initially claimed he planned to publish the findings of Ambrosia\u2019s study in a peer-reviewed journal after its clinic was open. He announced this week on his website that Ambrosia is scheduling clients again in San Francisco and Tampa. He brought back two doctors he worked with during the study, he told HuffPost. He said this week that he still hadn\u2019t submitted any data for peer review \u2014 a process that can take months. He was \u201ceager to do so,\u201d but didn\u2019t know precisely when he would.\n\nCavalier quietly left the company this week, right before Ambrosia announced it was offering treatments again. He would not comment on the circumstances of his exit, but noted in an email that he was only with the company for \u201ca very brief period.\u201d Karmazin declined to comment further on Cavalier\u2019s departure.\n\nAnd at least one of Ambrosia\u2019s blood bank partners no longer sells young plasma. Shortly after HuffPost reached out to the South Texas blood bank in October, it abruptly halted all sales of young plasma products, according to an employee email chain HuffPost obtained.\n\n\u201cWe have had a few developments internally due to some negative press,\u201d an employee wrote on Oct. 22. Waltman, the STBTC executive, told HuffPost the bank would not supply Ambrosia with plasma for a clinic rollout because doing so would interfere with their ability to fulfill local needs. The HuffPost inquiry had no bearing on that issue, she added.\n\nFor all its press coverage, Ambrosia did not have any investors as of April 2017, Karmazin said; in September 2018, Karmazin told HuffPost that Ambrosia hadn\u2019t yet raised any money. That same month, he advertised on his LinkedIn page that the company was looking for $3 million to open its first clinic. By November, Karmazin said the LinkedIn posts had been removed because the company had garnered a \u201clarge amount of interest,\u201d but Ambrosia would not comment on whether it had any investors.\n\nDespite Karmazin\u2019s insistence that many people are excited about the treatment, over the course of reporting this story, Ambrosia declined to put HuffPost in touch with a single patient. Initially, Karmazin said the patients are protective of their privacy and \u201cafter the hundredth reporter asked to talk, people were just getting a little tired of answering the same questions.\u201d After HuffPost noted that it could find only one trial participant who had spoken to the press, Karmazin said that in the beginning, he had asked about 10 to 15 patients if they wanted to speak to reporters, but they all declined.\n\nIt appears the only participant in Ambrosia\u2019s trial who spoke to the press was a man from Georgia. He told a German newspaper that he was one of Ambrosia\u2019s first patients and had perhaps received \u201cmore blood plasma than anyone else in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia man was \u201cthe most excited person about this treatment,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. He died after going into cardiac arrest in February 2018 at the age of 65.\n\nYoung plasma \u201cisn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d the man told New Scientist last year. But he had hoped he could \u201cjust get 10 more healthy years of living.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s family did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the circumstances of his death, and a doctor familiar with his case declined to comment without a family member\u2019s permission. Karmazin said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment. It is unclear when the man received his final treatment with Ambrosia.\n\nThese days, Karmazin won\u2019t even publicly admit whether he has tried the treatment Ambrosia is hawking. He told one news outlet in June 2017 he hadn\u2019t, claiming he was waiting until he\u2019d be \u201cold enough\u201d at 35. In a separate interview in December 2017, when he was still not yet 35, he said he\u2019d tried it \u201ca few times\u201d and it felt \u201cpretty phenomenal.\u201d Speaking to HuffPost, he refused to comment, citing privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to confirm that I\u2019ve done it for the purposes of this interview,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, spending $8,000 on a young plasma transfusion is a \u201creally good use of people\u2019s health care dollars,\u201d Karmazin said. Those with certain diseases \u201cshould be getting treatment right away,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to be treating as many people as possible.\u201d\n\nThis week, Karmazin announced Ambrosia has lowered its age limit and raised its prices. People as young as 30 are now eligible for treatment. And two liters of young plasma costs $12,000.\n\nGot tips?

The new rule would not factor in the harder-to-quantify benefits linked to preventing those health consequences, such as protecting fetuses whose intelligence could be affected in the long term by the amount of mercury their mothers ingested when they were pregnant with them.\n\n\u201cThe administrator has concluded that the identification of these benefits is not sufficient, in light of the gross imbalance of monetized costs,\u201d the EPA announcement read, bucking the Obama administration\u2019s conclusion that the mercury rule should be evaluated on factors beyond monetary costs.\n\nIf the change is finalized, the mercury rule could be opened up to clearer legal challenges in court, and other clean air regulations may also be put at risk.\n\nThe change would also be a financial windfall for the coal industry. The mercury rule costs the coal industry $9.6 billion a year \u2015 making it one of the most expensive regulations ever issued by the EPA.\n\nBut the proposal reverses a decades-old finding \u2015 reaffirmed twice by the EPA \u2015 that the agency was within its legal grounds to control emissions of power-plant mercury and other dangerous pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses, neurological damage and cancer.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed now is the administration\u2019s attitude towards public health, and towards the coal industry\u201d Ann Weeks, legal director of the nonpartisan Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement. \u201cEPA proposes to disregard many of the important public benefits that result from controlling all the toxic air emissions from this industry.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the EPA\u2019s own analysis determined that the rule would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths, 130,000 asthma attacks and 5,700 hospital visits every year, and save taxpayers $90 billion in health care costs annually.\n\n\u201cChildren are especially vulnerable to environmental changes as they are smaller in size, breathe faster than adults, and experience rapid and critical periods of growth and development,\u201d Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the EPA to maintain these critical standards, and call on Congress to protect the MATS rule so that all children, regardless of their ZIP code, can breathe clean air.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-30 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

At this time four years ago, many Republicans began preparing campaigns, wooing supporters and tacitly permitting fund-raising by allies in the wide-open race for the 2016 nomination, a contest that would ultimately attract more than a dozen candidates within months.\n\nAlready, at least two of the senators have nearly settled on close political lieutenants to serve as campaign managers, turning to male aides with whom they have deep and trusting personal relationships. Ms. Gillibrand is eyeing Jess Fassler, her current top aide, who is leaving his role in the Senate early in 2019, as a leading contender to manage her campaign. Ms. Harris is expected to name Juan Rodriguez, who helmed her campaign for the Senate in 2016, as her manager.\n\nIn a further sign of how developed her plans are, Ms. Harris\u2019s aides are close to selecting Baltimore or Atlanta for her headquarters, according to people who have met with her team. She is likely to maintain a sizable office on the West Coast, perhaps in her native Oakland, but her political advisers have concluded that for practical reasons it is essential that she have a base in the Eastern Time zone.\n\nMs. Warren is expected to install Dan Geldon, her former chief of staff who was once her student at Harvard Law School and left her Senate office to plan her likely campaign, in a senior role directing campaign strategy. She has a head start on staffing: During the midterm campaign, Ms. Warren deployed staff to the four early primary states and a number of general election battlegrounds to elect other Democrats.

When she first ran the House from 2007 to 2011, Ms. Pelosi oversaw a strongly top-down management structure as she worked with Mr. Obama and the Democratic Senate on economic recovery, the new health care law and a climate change measure that died in the Senate. Republicans were uniformly opposed to the Democratic efforts and had little role in the legislative process.\n\nMs. Pelosi is now under pressure from some in her own party to cede some authority, give committee leaders more leeway and bring more Democrats into House decision making. As she rounded up votes in her drive to return as speaker, Ms. Pelosi also agreed to demands to enact rules changes intended to make the House more bipartisan and empower the rank and file. As a result, Republicans could have a chance to get proposals considered in committee and by the House provided they can secure some level of Democratic buy-in.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the place is going to breathe a little bit more,\u201d Mr. Cole said.\n\nOne huge difference from the last time Democrats swung back into power is inescapable \u2014 President Trump. While Democrats had their differences with President George W. Bush, particularly over the war in Iraq, the volatile conflicts with Mr. Trump are at another level entirely. Democrats are already digging in for a series of investigations that will provide a unique challenge for House Republicans if they choose to take up the president\u2019s cause.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be a lot of investigations,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cWe have to be ready to be on defense when the investigations go too far.\u201d\n\nAll of the Republicans said there was still a possibility, even in this hyper-polarized congressional era, for the two parties to find some consensus on a few issues, notably infrastructure. But given that the new Congress is kicking off with a shutdown caused by a deep partisan stalemate, it is hard to see much room for big compromises.\n\nRepublicans say they must adapt and try for a comeback.\n\n\u201cEverything changes rapidly,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cTwo years is not an eternity. You can get through these things.

Many voted to do so in 2013 as part of a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration overhaul. But they view a wall like the one Mr. Trump advocates as an ineffective and costly response to an immigration system in disrepair.\n\nLawmakers in the party have offered Mr. Trump $1.3 billion for border security. Democratic leaders say they see little incentive to negotiate with the president after he repeatedly reversed himself on border funding, or to allocate more than $1.3 billion since the administration has spent only a small fraction of the money Congress approved last year for barriers along the border.\n\nWhite House officials say that the president, who is concerned about the collapse of his own political support, feels good about his stance on the shutdown and sees no urgency toward making a deal with the incoming Democratic majority. And Mr. Trump has indicated to people that he believes the shutdown will slow down the Democrats in other pursuits, such as oversight investigations into his administration.\n\nThe children\u2019s deaths have prompted a wave of criticism of Customs and Border Protection practices.

But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.\n\nAt any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.\n\nAlmost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.\n\nMost belong to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed.
