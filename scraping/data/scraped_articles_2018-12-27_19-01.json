The agency also is reviewing other custody options to relieve capacity issues in the El Paso, Texas, sector, such as working with nongovernmental organizations or local partners for temporary housing.\n\n\u2022 Nielsen said she has asked that Centers for Disease Control experts investigate the increase in sick migrant children in order to identify steps hospitals along the border can take to treat them.\n\n\u2022 The US Coast Guard Medical Corps has been asked to assess CBP's medical programs and recommend improvements. The Defense Department has been asked to provide additional medical professionals.\n\n\u2022 Finally, CBP is reviewing its policies, with a focus on the care and custody of children under 10 -- both at intake and beyond 24 hours in custody, the agency said.\n\nWhat happened to the 8-year-old boy\n\nCBP released a timeline of the days before the boy's death .

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Fifty-seven years later, Gabriel Bach still pauses to compose himself when he tells the story of the girl in the red coat. Bach took time to speak with me last week about his experience as one of three Israeli prosecutors who tried the notorious Nazi logistics director Adolf Eichmann for war crimes in Jerusalem in 1961.\n\nBach, now 91, still remembers the testimony of one particular Holocaust survivor. Responding to Bach's questioning, the survivor, Dr. Martin Foldi, described how he was transported in a cattle car from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944 with his wife, son and daughter. Upon arrival, two lines formed. A Nazi guard signaled for Foldi to go right and Foldi's wife, son and daughter to go left.\n\nFoldi had recently bought a red coat for his daughter, who was 2\u00bd years old. When Foldi looked up a few moments after being separated from his family, he could no longer see his wife or son in the distance. But, Bach recalls, Foldi testified he could see \"that little red dot getting smaller and smaller -- this is how my family disappeared from my life.\"\n\nLike any good prosecutor, Bach tried to maintain an unflappable demeanor. However, even in a trial recounting countless colossal horrors, Bach said the testimony about the red coat was the \"only minute of the trial ... I suddenly couldn't utter a sound.\" Aware that the judges were waiting for him to continue and that television cameras were rolling, Bach pretended to shuffle papers on his desk to allow himself a moment to recover.\n\nBach's life story is particularly relevant today given the rising tide of ethnic and racial intolerance -- and extremist attacks borne of such hatred -- in the United States and across the globe. More than five decades ago, as the whole world watched, Bach faced down Eichmann, an infamous Nazi officer who perpetrated genocide on a nearly unthinkable scale, in a courtroom in Israel. The lessons from the Eichmann trial -- about the rule of law, the quest for justice and the dangers posed by ethnic hatred -- still resonate today.\n\nEichmann was known as the \" architect \" of the Holocaust because he was responsible for identifying, gathering and transporting millions of Jews and others to concentration camps across Europe. Bach refers to Eichmann as the \"director of the Holocaust\" because of his central role in planning and carrying out the execution of millions of innocents.\n\nProsecuting the architect of the Holocaust\n\nAmerican forces captured Eichmann at the end of World War II, but he escaped from a prison camp in 1946. He remained in hiding while an international manhunt ensued. Fourteen years after Eichmann's escape, Israeli intelligence agents captured him in Argentina in 1960 (as depicted in several books and movies, including 2018's \" Operation Finale \") and then transported him to Jerusalem for trial.\n\nThe trial began in April 1961. Bach led the prosecution team's investigation, gathering witnesses, documents, film and other evidence from around the globe. He presented testimony from numerous witnesses, including survivors with remarkable stories; one had been a young child who was let out of a locked gas chamber just before execution to help unload a delivery of potatoes that had arrived at the camp. Bach felt it was important that the court hear from at least one survivor from every Nazi-occupied country.\n\nAdolf Eichmann, the Holocaust's \"architect,\" goes on trial in Jerusalem in 1961 after Israel captured him.\n\nOver four months, the world watched as Bach and his colleagues methodically laid out the proof of Eichmann's crimes. During the trial, Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass box. Bach sat just feet away at counsel's table. Bach recalls that, throughout the trial, Eichmann was stoic and unemotional.\n\nEichmann and his court-appointed attorney maintained during the trial that he merely followed orders from his Nazi superiors. Hannah Arendt, who covered the trial for The New Yorker, later contended in her controversial book \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" that Eichmann embodied the \"banality of evil.\" Arendt wrote, \"Eichmann was not Iago and not Macbeth. ... Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement, he had no motives at all. ... He merely, to put the matter colloquially, never realized what he was doing.\"\n\nBach responds to Arendt's conclusion first with visceral disgust -- he calls her view \"rubbish\" -- and then with the methodical precision of a skilled prosecutor. Bach notes that Eichmann declared after the Holocaust (but before the 1961 trial) that he regretted not having done more to kill Jews. Bach then reels off examples where Eichmann took pains to prevent any person from being spared or shown mercy.\n\nIn one instance, a German general requested that a French Jewish man who was an expert in radar technology be spared so his knowledge could be utilized; Eichmann rejected the request and ordered the man deported to a concentration camp. Bach also notes that Eichmann believed it was imperative to kill children, to prevent the maturation of future generations of Jews. Arendt can have her theorizing; Bach is secure resting on the hard facts.\n\nEichmann stands in a protective glass booth flanked by Israeli police during his 1961 war crimes trial.\n\nAt the end of the trial, a three-judge panel convicted Eichmann of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other offenses, and sentenced him to death. Eichmann appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, where Bach successfully defended the verdict and sentence. Eichmann was executed by hanging on June 1, 1962. Bach was offered the opportunity to witness the execution but declined.\n\nBach does not seek to cast himself in an angelic glow, candidly acknowledging that \"I was so much full of hatred for this man (Eichmann).\" Bach takes pride, however, that despite the intense emotion surrounding the case, Eichmann was tried in accordance with established rule of law and principles of fairness. Bach, who tried many cases as prosecutor and defense attorney before the Eichmann trial, notes that \"we wanted to handle this case like we handled any other case.\"\n\nIndeed, Eichmann, the most notorious of all criminals, was afforded the same rights as other defendants in Israel at the time (which also are familiar to the American criminal justice system): the right to competent defense counsel, paid for by the state; the right to see the evidence against him in advance; the right to evidence that might be helpful to the defense; the right to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses and to call his own witnesses; and the right to appeal. Bach understood that \"it was important for history's sake that every point of legal decency had to be followed.\"\n\n'Always sort of just one step ahead'\n\nAt 91, Bach sees that he has lived an almost impossibly charmed life. Bach grew up in Berlin, where he attended the 1936 Olympics and sat so close to Adolf Hitler that he says he saw Hitler leave his private box in anger after Jesse Owens sprinted to a gold medal. Bach's Jewish family fled from Germany for the Netherlands just weeks before Kristallnacht -- when the rising Nazi party destroyed Jewish homes and properties and killed dozens of German Jews -- in November 1938.\n\nHis family then left the Netherlands one month before the Nazis invaded in 1940 and moved to the territory that would later become Israel. Bach was bar mitzvahed while in transit, on board the ship Patria -- which, on its next journey, was sunk by a bomb placed on board by Zionists -- claiming the lives of more than 250 people. Bach reflects that he and his family were \"always sort of just one step ahead.\"\n\nBach holds a photo as he tours the 2011 exhibit \"Facing Justice -- Adolf Eichmann on Trial\" in Berlin.\n\nAfter the Eichmann trial, Bach went on to a distinguished legal career, including 15 years as a justice on the Israeli Supreme Court. He now lives a quiet, happy life with his wife in Jerusalem. They have three grown children (one of whom has passed) and eight grandchildren. In his advanced age, Bach still has a sparkle in his eye, an easy laugh and a natural warmth. He has a steel trap memory for the details of the Eichmann trial and a deep faith in and respect for the rule of law.\n\nBach has spoken about his life and the Eichmann trial countless times on five continents, in countries as disparate as Brazil, Japan, South Africa and the Philippines. He has spoken many times in Germany, including in Berlin at the Parliament, where he was moved by the warm reception he received. In Israel, he is a national hero and was greeted at a recent speaking appearance with a thunderous standing ovation from a sellout crowd.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Nor can he fathom why so many people know little or nothing about the Holocaust or doubt that it ever happened.\n\nHe does, however, hold out hope that the Eichmann trial will stand through history as an unambiguous condemnation of ethnic hatred and violence. \"The fact that this terrible thing happened should never be forgotten,\" Bach says. \"And everything should be done to teach young people and older people to prevent something like that from happening in the future.

The agency also is reviewing other custody options to relieve capacity issues in the El Paso, Texas, sector, such as working with nongovernmental organizations or local partners for temporary housing.\n\n\u2022 Nielsen said she has asked that Centers for Disease Control experts investigate the increase in sick migrant children in order to identify steps hospitals along the border can take to treat them.\n\n\u2022 The US Coast Guard Medical Corps has been asked to assess CBP's medical programs and recommend improvements. The Defense Department has been asked to provide additional medical professionals.\n\n\u2022 Finally, CBP is reviewing its policies, with a focus on the care and custody of children under 10 -- both at intake and beyond 24 hours in custody, the agency said.\n\nWhat happened to the 8-year-old boy\n\nCBP released a timeline of the days before the boy's death . On Monday, the boy was taken to a hospital, diagnosed with a cold, released with medication, then taken back to the hospital before dying about 12 minutes before Christmas.\n\nThe cause of the boy's death is not clear. But an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday in Albuquerque, according to the University of New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator\n\nCastro called for a congressional investigation into the boy's death.\n\n\"While the CBP notified Congress within 24 hours as mandated by law, we must ensure that we treat migrants and asylum-seekers with human dignity and provide the necessary medical care to anyone in the custody of the United States government,\" the congressman said Tuesday.\n\nAsylum A protected status that allows people fleeing persecution to live legally in another country.\n\nMany people wonder why asylum-seekers cross illegally rather than at a legal point of entry.

Before this month, there were six deaths in CBP custody in 2018, and none of those were children, DHS officials said.\n\nBefore Jakelin's death, no child had died in CBP custody in more than a decade, a Department of Homeland Security official said.\n\nIn the last two months alone, the Border Patrol has apprehended 139,817 undocumented migrants on the Southwest Border, compared to 74,946 during the same time in fiscal 2018, Nielsen said.\n\n\"It is now clear that migrants, particularly children, are increasingly facing medical challenges and harboring illness caused by their long and dangerous journey,\" said Nielsen, who announced that she will travel to the border later this week to review medical screenings and Border Patrol stations.\n\nStill, the death of a child in custody is \"an extraordinarily rare occurrence,\" McAleenan told CBS.\n\nBut now, as more children cross the border, \"We're doing dozens of hospital trips every single day with children that have fevers or manifest other medical conditions,\" McAleenan said Wednesday.\n\n\"We've asked for help.

The White House hasn't provided any further details about the claim, which Trump first made on Twitter on Christmas Eve.\n\nHe said he would go to the new stretch of the wall in January.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Doctors question medical care given to migrant boy who died Christmas Eve", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Kp55Y23SzZo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Days after a Guatemalan boy died in US custody on Christmas Eve, infectious disease experts say it appears Felipe Alonzo-Gomez likely had the flu, a potentially deadly illness that can often be treated if caught early enough.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection issued a statement Tuesday saying the boy had \"possible influenza symptoms\" on Monday and was taken to a local hospital.\n\ndetailed account of the child's care released by the federal agency does not mention a flu test being administered to Felipe.

She shoots heroin up to 10 times per day, she says.\n\nAbout 50 yards away, a man injects another woman in the neck with a needle. She puts her thumb in her mouth and blows on it to make her vein more visible. Her right arm is caked with dried blood.\n\nCNN obscured parts of this photo to protect the identity of the subjects.\n\nThis San Francisco neighborhood is home to the headquarters of Uber, Twitter and Salesforce. But stroll around here, and you're also likely to find used drug paraphernalia, trash, and human excrement on the sidewalks, and people lying in various states of consciousness.\n\nPublic drug usage and homelessness are not new problems for the city of San Francisco. But residents say the situation has gotten worse in recent years. As of October, 7,500 complaints about discarded needles have been made this year, compared with 6,363 last year. In 2015, the number was less than 3,000.\n\nIt's moved some locals -- so-called \"video vigilantes\" -- to document the mess they see, in an attempt to get the city's attention.\n\nAdam Mesnick, a restaurateur who lives and works in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, started posting daily photos and videos of people using drugs in public, urinating near his restaurant, or lying passed out on the sidewalk.\n\n\"More mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco,\" Mesnick wrote in one post, accompanied by photos of angry sores on people's backs, hands and legs.\n\nmore mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco, homeless addicts.

In another, human feces lies nestled in front of a doorway. In a video apparently taken from inside Mesnick's restaurant, a man can be seen urinating in a doorway across the street.\n\nMesnick isn't trying to shame homeless people with his Twitter posts, he says, but \"to actually find help for these people.\" He's been giving leftover food from his restaurant to the homeless for the past ten years, he said.\n\nOver the past five or six years, Mesnick says, visible homelessness and drug use on the streets have seemed to spread from areas of San Francisco where they were once concentrated, like the Tenderloin.\n\nThis has been like this since Friday. Yes today is Monday. pic.twitter.com/d91e9MU2VY \u2014 bettersoma (@bettersoma) October 29, 2018\n\n\"It's like third world squalor,\" Mesnick said. \"I'm a small business (owner) trying to exist, and basically surrounded by decay that continues to get worse and worse and worse.\"\n\nOthers fear that the situation will impact tourism. \"If we can't find a solution to this problem,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, CEO of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, \"it will tarnish the city's brand.\"\n\nAnother longtime resident tweets about the state of the neighborhood using the handle @cleanupwestsoma. He asked to remain anonymous because his friends don't know he runs the account, and says he's lived in San Francisco for 21 years, 12 of them in SoMa.\n\n\"I post as I go to work. I'll sometimes come home from lunch and see a giant drug deal going on,\" he said. \"I'll leave and go back to work and see someone going to the bathroom in the street. It blows me away that this continues to happen in the city.\"\n\nMesnick and @cleanupwestsoma want to send a message to city officials about what's happening in their neighborhoods. They often tweet at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who took office in a special election in July after the death of Mayor Ed Lee.\n\n\"You know what? I already had the message, as a native San Franciscan, as someone who's been here all my life,\" Breed told CNN. \"It isn't acceptable.\"\n\nBreed, 44, made tackling homelessness and drug addiction a signature of her campaign platform. She says the city has been making changes since she took office, and that they're slowly starting to have an impact. \"It's not an unsolvable problem,\" she said.\n\nLast week, the mayor announced a detailed plan to direct a $181 million cash windfall the city received from the state to homelessness, affordable housing and related problems. The proposal includes nearly $20 million to be spent on beds for patients who have addiction and mental health problems. An additional $4 million would go toward expanding street cleaning.\n\nAnd Breed says visible progress has already been made.\n\n\"If you walk with me right now, you will see the difference,\" she said. \"You'll see more police officers. You'll see the homeless outreach team. You'll see people power-washing on a regular basis and picking up trash.\" Tent encampments are down by 27% since she took office, she said.\n\nKevin Schwing, who works in SoMa, said that despite the city's efforts, he doesn't see a change in the numbers of people on the streets.\n\n\"I don't really know what the city can do,\" he said. \"The city cleans up sidewalks every day. But I don't see any difference in terms of the amount of people.\"\n\n\"I see human waste. Injections. Probably 10 times per day,\" he said. \"Sometimes people look like they're dead.\"\n\nBreed says the city is cracking down on drug dealing, and aims to open at least 1,000 new shelter beds by the end of 2020.\n\nAnd she's looking at new ways to approach these entrenched problems, she says. Breed supports safe injection sites -- facilities where people can inject heroin in a private setting and under the supervision of health care workers. The sites would \"not only be a way to get people off the streets and get the needles off the streets, but to get people into treatment,\" Breed said. California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have allowed safe injection sites in the state.\n\nShe also supports conservatorship programs for the severely mentally ill, which would allow the state to \"make decisions for them in order to place them into mental health stabilization beds, instead of our criminal justice system.\" Gov. Brown recently signed a bill that would allow such action to take place.\n\nBreed says she hopes the \"video vigilantes\" tag 311, the city's non-emergency complaint service center, in their posts. The information they're putting out helps the city address challenges in specific neighborhoods, she said.\n\nThe city's Department of Public Health recently partnered with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, essentially hiring contract workers to fan the streets and collect used needles.\n\nCrisis intervention teams have also stepped up their efforts to provide addicts with the drug buprenorphine, a narcotic to help reduce a person's addiction to heroin and other opioids.\n\n\"We go to people that are using drugs and offer them treatment instead of the traditional model which has people coming into a clinic,\" said Dr. Naveena Bobba, the department's deputy director of health.\n\nThe city has also launched the so-called \"poop patrol,\" a team that responds to complaints of feces on city streets.\n\nSoMa resident Alesia Panajota said she sees an impact. \"They're doing the best they can,\" she said. \"I think things are getting better under London Breed.\"\n\nSan Francisco may also see an influx of cash to help solve the crisis, after a controversial ballot measure passed in November. Known as \"Prop C,\" the measure is viewed as a \"homeless tax\" -- it aims to raise $300 million a year to spend on homeless services by taxing big businesses.\n\nSalesforce Chairman and Co-CEO Marc Benioff spent at least $7 million of his own money to help ensure Prop C's passage. \"We have to say enough is enough,\" he recently told CNN.\n\nBut legal challenges could prevent the city from receiving the funds for several years.\n\nIn the meantime, Mesnick keeps posting. He recently put up a video interview with a homeless man talking about how difficult it is to find a place to go to the bathroom after dark.\n\n\"Help this guy,\" Mesnick wrote. \"Keep the restrooms open at night? Perhaps we change usage of our space and make it a bathroom share? Better than on our front stoop...\"\n\n\"We are in a severe epidemic here,\" he told CNN. \"My angle may seem to be a little rough around the edges, but it's really about compassion.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "One city's answer to preventing teen e-cigarette use: Sell in adult-only stores", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/a0oHJ8rqllg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Attempting to beat back the rise of vaping among teens, the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, voted this month to limit e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes to the shelves of tobacco stores open only to customers 21 and older.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Massachusetts raising the legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21, which goes into effect on December 31.\n\nSomerville's move, the first of its kind in the state and possibly the nation, goes further by taking menthol and e-cigarettes out of shops, like convenience stores, that teens can enter.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad. It's very bad.\"\n\nBailey's story\n\nBailey was a healthy little girl until October 28, 2014, when she suddenly couldn't move her neck or her right shoulder or leg.\n\nA rehabilitation expert at a children's hospital said Bailey wasn't really paralyzed, according to her mother, Mikell Sheehan.\n\nThe doctor said the paralysis was an emotional reaction to her sister's birth four months earlier. He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Iceland crash: Three British people including child killed", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46695431", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Adolf Ingi Erlingsson\n\nThree British tourists, including a young child, have died after their vehicle crashed while crossing a bridge in Iceland.\n\nThe vehicle - a 4x4 - was carrying seven British people when the accident happened at around 9:30 GMT on Thursday, Icelandic Police said.\n\nThe other four passengers in the car were critically injured and airlifted to hospital, police said.\n\nTwo of those seriously injured are children aged between seven and nine.\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser crashed through a railing on a one-lane bridge in southern Iceland.\n\nIt then fell around eight metres onto a sandy river bank.\n\nThe accident happened in an area called N\u00fapsv\u00f6tn on Iceland's ring road between the town of Kirkjub\u00e6jarklaustur and area of Skaftafell, which is part of the Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park beauty spot.\n\nSveinn Kristjan Runarsson, Chief Superintendent of south Iceland Police said police have not yet been able to talk to the injured passengers - who are now in hospital in Iceland's capital Reykjavik - about what happened.\n\nHe said it was not clear whether the seven people were related.\n\nPolice said it is not thought the road was icy, but humidity could have made the bridge's surface - which is made of steel - slippery.\n\n'Horrible'\n\nOne of the first people on the scene was tour guide Adolf Erlingsson, who told BBC News he believed the driver had lost control.\n\nImage copyright Adolf Ingi Erlingsson Image caption The accident took place on a 200-300 metre bridge over the area of N\u00fapsv\u00f6tn on Iceland's ring road\n\nMr Erlingsson said the car \"went through the railing and crashed down onto the bank\".\n\n\"It's kind of sandy, there's no rivers so it wasn't submerged in water.

senior police officer has said.\n\nMet Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad.\n\nShe told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed.\n\nParliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it.\n\nThe prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc.\n\nAfter Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects.\n\nThe agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations.\n\nThe EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome.\n\n'Slower and costlier'\n\nMs Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit.\n\nWhile she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\".\n\n\"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can.\n\n\"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\"\n\nThe Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit.\n\nShe also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary.\n\n\"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\"\n\n'Mutually beneficial'\n\nMs Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU.\n\nBut campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.\n\nThe organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.\n\n\"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.\n\nThe Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.\n\n\"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this.\n\nIn the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers.\n\nShe said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".\n\nThe authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the private sector and the military to ensure there was no repeat."}, {"site": "bbc", "category":

A team, the magazine pointed out, which would usually have their identities protected.\n\nMalcolm Nance, a former US Navy intelligence specialist, told the magazine it would be a very unusual decision to picture them so clearly while on duty because, if any of them were captured, \"there would be no denying who you are and what you do\".\n\nMr Trump also took a selfie with US Navy Lt Cmdr Kyu Lee, who told him he was with Seal Team Five - a fact later reported by the pool of reporters travelling with the president.\n\nThe White House has not commented on why they decided against taking such precautions, as some of his predecessors did.\n\nFiction: What was the pay rise figure?\n\nThe president also announced that he had secured a sizable pay increase for troops.\n\nSome of his advisers had suggested 2, 3 or 4%, he said, adding that he had made clear that this was not enough: \"I said: 'No. Make it 10%.

Within seven years, that should reach 203,000.\n\nShe said the army was now made up of 12% women and this year alone one in three people applying to be an officer was a woman.\n\nWhat does the defence chief propose?\n\nGen Zorn told the Funke newspaper group that \"of course the Bundeswehr needs personnel\" and the army had to \"push hard for a suitable new generation\", although EU citizens in uniform were \"an option\" to be examined only in specialist fields.\n\nThe media group said the government had already consulted EU partners and that most had reacted cautiously, particularly in Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder post-World War Two laws, soldiers in the German military have to be German.\n\nParliament's commissioner for the armed forces, Hans-Peter Bartels, said recruiting EU citizens was already a \"kind of normality\" as many soldiers already had dual nationality or an immigrant background.\n\nAccording to the Funke group, more than 900 foreign citizens are already employed by the military in civilian roles.\n\nLast month the UK said more foreign nationals would be able to join its armed forces without having lived in the country in a bid to meet a shortfall of 8,200 soldiers, sailors and air personnel.\n\nHow unprepared is the German army?\n\nGermany aims to have 70% of its fighting capacity ready for combat at any time, but recent reports show it is falling short:\n\nOnly about a third of 97 newly manufactured tanks, fighter jets and helicopters was combat-ready, Die Zeit reported in October (in German)\n\nNo submarines or large transport planes were available for deployment at the end of last year, a military report said in February\n\nThe same report said existing fighter planes, tanks, helicopters and ships were in \"dramatically bad\" condition\n\nAbout 21,000 officer posts remained unfilled, Deutsche Welle reported\n\nHow did shortages hit Merkel's G20 trip?\n\nThe spotlight fell on military shortages late last month when Chancellor Angela Merkel had to fly to the G20 summit in Argentina by passenger plane because of a technical failure involving one of the military's two long-haul planes.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Chancellor Merkel's plane lost radio control as it flew over the Netherlands on 29 November and had to land in Cologne\n\nMs Von der Leyen said one or two new long-haul planes would be bought, as the two existing planes aged 18 and 19 were too few.\n\nThe technical failure involving Mrs Merkel's government plane has been blamed on German airline Lufthansa, according to a report in Der Spiegel.\n\nWhen the pilots tried to reboot the A340's electronics during an in-flight power failure they were unable to restart the radio.\n\nAccording to a confidential report cited by Spiegel, the pilots had not been informed of new instructions to restart the radio after Lufthansa's technical subsidiary installed a digital communications system in 2009.\n\nWhy is the military underfunded?\n\nFor such a big country it may appear strange to have a relatively ill-equipped army.\n\nBut after reunification the Bundeswehr gradually shrank in size from 486,000 in 1990 to 168,000 in 2015.\n\nThere was no perceived military threat after the Cold War and cuts to defence spending continued until 2014.\n\nGerman forces played key but limited Nato roles in Kosovo and Afghanistan, but that was before two key developments: a resurgent Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and so-called Islamic State seized territory in Syria in 2013.\n\nThe culture of underfunding changed and last month an opinion poll suggested 43% of Germans agreed on the need for greater defence spending, up from 32% in 2017.\n\nHow big should Germany's army be?\n\nThe defence minister says that all depends on the security situation.\n\nGermany pledged hundreds of troops for a Nato presence in the Baltics and Poland this year, but it faces other threats too.\n\nA month ago the army was targeted by cyber-attackers, possibly emanating from Russia, and some of the new spending will go on cyber security."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link":

member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal

variety of technical issues to be overcome.\n\n'Slower and costlier'\n\nMs Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit.\n\nWhile she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\".\n\n\"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people,

UK left.\n\n\"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.\n\nThe Home Office said it had proposed an

shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers.\n\nShe said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".\n\nThe authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working

environment secretary.\n\nThe change is contained in a government consultation aimed at further reducing the plastic used by consumers and could come into effect in January 2020.\n\nSmaller retailers, who are exempt from the current levy, supply an estimated 3.6 billion single-use bags annually.\n\nSchools in England are also being told to eliminate unnecessary plastic.\n\nEducation Secretary

do even more to protect our precious planet and today's announcement will accelerate further behaviour change and build on the success of the existing charge.\"\n\nSince the 5p fee was introduced in 2015 for retailers with at least 250 employees, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation.\n\nTrade bodies representing about 40,000 small retailers have launched a voluntary approach to a 5p charge, but this accounts for less than one-fifth of companies likely to be affected by the proposed changes.\n\nAnalysis\n\nby Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst\n\nThe government wavered for years before imposing a plastic bag tax for England - but the result of the policy eventually introduced is crystal clear: taxes change behaviour.\n\nPeople who previously thought nothing of carting home their supermarket shopping in half a dozen flimsy plastic bags seem appalled by the prospect of a 30p charge, and dig into their handbags for nylon bags instead.\n\nA similar shift in behaviour will surely be seen now in local stores, although the change may be less marked because people tend to buy smaller quantities from corner shops, so may be willing to pay an extra 10p for convenience.\n\nIt's also possible that these convenience store bags disproportionately harm the environment because they're used by people picking up snacks while visiting beauty spots or beaches.\n\nThe announcement of a consultation on an increased charge is part of a broader move towards environmental taxation - an issue which can easily cause governments trouble if they don't protect the poorest from the impact of the taxes.\n\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags.\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society says the levies have had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea.\n\nOceanographer Laura Foster, head of Clean Seas at the MCS, said: \"We are able to measure the impact of legislation and we've seen that since the introduction of the plastic bag charge in the UK the amount we find on the beaches has gone down.\n\n\"That's also been replicated by studies that have been done offshore. They've also seen a reduction in the amount of plastic bags they find.\"\n\nWhile retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money consumers pay for plastic bags, they are expected to give it to good causes. According to Defra, an estimated \u00a351m was donated in 2017-18.\n\nThe Association of Convenience Stores, which is backing Defra's plans, says about half of the small shops it represents in England are currently charging for plastic bags.\n\nACS chief executive James Lowman said: \"This has been shown to be highly effective at reducing waste, whilst also raising money for local, national and environmental charities.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Huawei: 'Deep concerns' over firm's role in UK 5G upgrade", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46690627", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters\n\nThe Defence Secretary has reportedly said he has \"very deep concerns\" about Chinese firm Huawei being involved in upgrading the UK's mobile network.\n\nGavin Williamson's comments - reported by the Times - came after some nations restricted use of the firm's products in 5G networks over security concerns.\n\nMI6's head recently said Britain faced decisions on Chinese ownership of tech.\n\nThe UK says China is behind hackers targeting commercial secrets.

Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

Researchers had argued that keeping within this limit was necessary to avoid the most damaging effects of global warming.\n\nBut some have been pushing for an even lower target of 1.5C. In October, climate scientists released a major report detailing what would be involved in keeping the temperature rise to within that tougher limit.\n\nThis would result in millions fewer people losing their homes to rising seas, fewer species at risk of extinction and a drastic reduction in the numbers of people experiencing water scarcity.\n\nBut it would also be hugely expensive and require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to society. The report didn't tell governments what to do, but set out a range of approaches including heavy cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes.\n\nOther climate change stories from 2018\n\nThe earliest animals\n\nImage copyright ANU\n\nThe one-million-plus animal species alive today are staggeringly diverse, from the giant oceanic blue whale to the wriggly earthworms beneath our feet. But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the \"Ediacaran biota\" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.\n\nBut their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.\n\nIn September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish. Cholesterol is one of the molecular hallmarks of animal life, clearly demonstrating that the Ediacaran biota were animals.\n\nOther palaeontology stories from 2018\n\nGiant plastic berg\n\nThe world's plastic waste crisis was one of the big themes of 2018. The problem had been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet 2 series, presented by David Attenborough, which contained shocking footage of the devastation wrought on the oceans and marine life by our addiction to plastic.\n\nIn April, our Science Editor, David Shukman, visited Indonesia to report on a morass of plastic waste that had clogged rivers and canals in Bandung, on the Indonesian island of Java. The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.\n\nWorryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.\n\nOther plastic waste stories from 2018\n\nGhost particle busters\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: Blazars are powered by massive black holes\n\nNeutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.\n\nMany neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle \"ray\" straight at the Earth.\n\nThis type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.\n\nThe IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.\n\nOther astronomy stories from 2018\n\nA watery Mars - and Moon\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems Image caption The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars\n\nWe know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.\n\n\"We are not closer to actually detecting life,\" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, \"but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.\"\n\nMars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.\n\nData from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles. This ancient water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon.\n\nOther planetary science stories from 2018\n\nWhat happened to the Stonehenge builders?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Stonehenge builders were largely replaced by the Beaker people, but pockets may have lingered\n\nThe field of ancient DNA - which involves extracting and analysing genetic material from long-dead people - has provided us with unprecedented insights into the past. One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.\n\nIn a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to a girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.\n\nOther ancient DNA stories from 2018\n\nIcy impact\n\nImage copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nIn November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nThe bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.\n\nThere is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.\n\nOther earth science stories from 2018:\n\nAn earlier exodus\n\nImage copyright Israel Hershkovitz, Tel Aviv Uni Image caption The jawbone from Mislya cave in Israel dates to 185,000 years ago\n\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.\n\nIn January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.\n\nBut the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.\n\nOther human evolution stories from 2018\n\nRocks from Mars\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth\n\nAfter years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.\n\nIn April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first \"round trip\" to another planet.\n\nThe venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.\n\nUS missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.\n\nThere's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.\n\nOther space exploration stories from 2018\n\nPlastic in our water\n\nImage copyright Alice Trevail Image caption Some of the fragments are very small\n\nPlastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water.

Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.\n\nOur planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.\n\nThe number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean.

They've also seen a reduction in the amount of plastic bags they find.\"\n\nWhile retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money consumers pay for plastic bags, they are expected to give it to good causes. According to Defra, an estimated \u00a351m was donated in 2017-18.\n\nThe Association of Convenience Stores, which is backing Defra's plans, says about half of the small shops it represents in England are currently charging for plastic bags.\n\nACS chief executive James Lowman said: \"This has been shown to be highly effective at reducing waste, whilst also raising money for local, national and environmental charities.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "The Most Indifferent Animals At The Petting Zoo This Year", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/the-most-indifferent-animals-at-the-petting-zoo-this-ye-1831303137", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "The Big Sheep: It\u2019s frustrating being told to \u201cwatch your fingers,\u201d but what\u2019s even more frustrating is offering them and not getting so much as a nibble.\n\nRabbit: We don\u2019t know what it looks like when a rabbit is excited, but that wasn\u2019t it.\n\nLlama: It was kinda cool to see a Llama, but it wanted nothing to do with us.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Both in the past have denied that their products are used to spy.\n\nRural operators in the United States are among the biggest customers of Huawei and ZTE, and worry that they may also have to rip out existing Chinese-made equipment without compensation. Industry officials are divided on whether the administration could legally compel operators to do that.\n\nThe executive order, which has been under consideration for more than eight months, could be issued as early as January and would direct the Commerce Department to block U.S. companies from buying equipment from foreign telecommunications makers that pose significant national security risks, sources from the telecoms industry and the administration said.\n\nWhile the order is unlikely to name Huawei or ZTE, a source said it is expected that Commerce officials would interpret it as authorization to limit the spread of equipment made by the two companies. The sources said the text for the order has not been finalized.\n\nThe United States and China are locked in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.\n\nThe executive order would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States.\n\nThe issue has new urgency as U.S. wireless carriers look for partners as they prepare to adopt next generation 5G wireless networks.\n\nIn August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nA White House official said the United States was \u201cworking across government and with our allies and like-minded partners to mitigate risk in the deployment of 5G and other communications infrastructure,\u201d but stated that the White House had nothing further to announce.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported in May that the order was under consideration, but it was never issued.\n\nHIT TO RURAL NETWORKS\n\nWhile the big U.S. wireless companies have cut ties with Huawei in particular, small rural carriers have relied on Huawei and ZTE switches and other equipment because they tend to be less expensive.\n\nHuawei is so central to small carriers that William Levy, vice president for sales of Huawei Tech USA, is on the board of directors of the Rural Wireless Association.\n\nThe RWA represents carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. It estimates that 25 percent of its members had Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks, it said in a filing to the Federal Communications Commission earlier this month.\n\nThe RWA is concerned that an executive order could force its members to remove ZTE and Huawei equipment and also bar future purchases, said Caressa Bennet, RWA general counsel.\n\nIt would cost $800 million to $1 billion for all RWA members to replace their Huawei and ZTE equipment, Bennet said.\n\nSeparately, the FCC in April granted initial approval to a regulation that bars giving federal funding to help pay for telecommunication infrastructure to companies that purchase equipment from firms deemed threats to U.S. national security, which analysts have said is aimed at Huawei and ZTE.\n\nThe FCC is also considering whether to require carriers to remove and replace equipment from firms deemed a national security risk.\n\nIn March, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said \u201chidden \u2018back doors\u2019 to our networks in routers, switches \u2014 and virtually any other type of telecommunications equipment - can provide an avenue for hostile governments to inject viruses, launch denial-of-service attacks, steal data, and more.\u201d\n\nIn the December filing, Pine Belt Communications in Alabama estimated it would cost $7 million to $13 million to replace its Chinese-made equipment, while Sagebrush in Montana said replacement would cost $57 million and take two years.\n\nSagebrush has noted that Huawei products are significantly cheaper. When looking for bids in 2010 for its network, it found the cost of Ericsson equipment to be nearly four times the cost of Huawei."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Poll: Michelle Obama is World's Most Admired Woman", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/poll-michelle-obama-is-world-s-most-admired-woman/4718419.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Former first lady Michelle Obama is the world's most admired woman in the eyes of Americans, the first woman other than Hillary Clinton to be designated as such in 17 years, according to a new Gallup poll.\n\nObama won by a wide margin in this year's poll after finishing second to the former secretary of state and former first lady in three previous surveys.\n\nBillionaire media mogul Oprah Winfrey came in second, followed by Clinton, and current first lady Melania Trump.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth ranked fifth, followed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama was first on the list of most admired men for the 11th straight year, topping his successor, President Donald Trump, who came in second for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nFormer President George W.

The insurgent group, however, continues to reject calls for engaging in negotiations with Afghan envoys. The group dismisses the Afghan government as puppets installed by the U.S. and considers Washington as its main adversary in the conflict.\n\nAlso Thursday, the Taliban demanded the U.S. withdraw from Afghanistan. The renewed demand was made following the anniversary of the 1979 military invasion of Afghanistan by the-then Soviet Union. The insurgent group claimed U.S.-led foreign forces are \u201cfacing the exact same fate\u201d that Soviet troops suffered in the shape of a forced withdrawal.\n\n\u201cIt [Taliban] advises the American invaders to adopt rational and understanding by withdrawing from Afghanistan and maintaining any future relations based on sound diplomatic and economic principles instead of testing might,\u201d the insurgent statement said.\n\nThe reported withdrawal plans have worried Afghan military officials, prompting Gen. Miller earlier this week to assure them of continued U.S. support.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have seen the same rumors I have, from the newspapers, but all I would assure you is first of all I have no orders, so nothing changed. But if I do get orders, I think it is important for you to know that we are still with the security forces,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Afghan authorities Wednesday said they are considering postponing for several months the presidential elections that were originally scheduled for April 20. The announcement has triggered speculation the delay would support the U.S.-led effort to strike a peace deal with the Taliban that would lay the groundwork for a credible non-controversial Afghan election process."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Medical Screenings Ordered After 2nd Migrant Child Dies in US Custody", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/medical-screenings-ordered-after-2nd-migrant-child-dies-in-us-custody-/4718184.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has ordered medical checks on all children in its custody after an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala died.

Funding for wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border remains a sticking point.\n\nThe standoff comes during the waning days of unified Republican control of the elective branches of government. Congress will see divided political control beginning Jan. 3, when the new Democratic majority in the House is sworn in.\n\n\u201cThe incentive for either party to cooperate across the aisle [bipartisanship] will be a little bit lower because both parties will be looking increasingly to blame the other side for not getting things done,\u201d said political analyst Molly Reynolds of the Washington-based Brookings Institution.\n\nReynolds added that there are \u201csome possible prospects for bipartisanship on things like [improving America\u2019s] infrastructure or [reducing the price of] prescription drugs, but by and large we\u2019ll see relatively little legislative progress in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe year 2010 saw the mirror image of the 2018 midterm election results. In 2010, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives and used it as a check on then-president Barack Obama, a Democrat, as well as what was then a Democratically led Senate.

Some things, like an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, could be out of reach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to enter the 2020 presidential campaign [cycle], and that will affect how Congress spends its time, what issues it\u2019s active on. I don\u2019t want to dismiss the possibility of immigration reform in the next two years outright, but I do think it will be an uphill battle for Congress,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\n\u201cWe have a divided country, we\u2019ll have divided government,\u201d John Fortier of the Bipartisan Policy Center said. \u201cThere are a few opportunities [for bipartisanship]. The trick in divided government is not to think that we\u2019re going to do everything together, but to find some discreet larger initiatives that both sides might find some interest in.\u201d\n\nChanges in party control of one or both houses of Congress occurred in 2007, 2011 and 2015, and will occur again in 2019. Throughout it all, Congress has suffered low approval ratings from the American people, a situation that is unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have sharper partisan edges in the body, a lot of partisan and ideological combat, tribal combat, in the coming years,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine that Americans are going to feel better about things.\u201d\n\nReynolds agreed. \u201cGridlock is likely to keep most Americans not terribly happy with how Washington works,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Race Plays Huge Role in Cleft Lip/Palate Deformities", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/race-plays-huge-role-in-cleft-lip-palate-deformities/4718458.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "A cleft lip or cleft palate is one of the most common birth defects worldwide. Before birth, babies can have a split, or cleft, in their lip and the roof of the mouth. This split normally closes between the 6th to 11th week of pregnancy. If this doesn't happen, and the baby is born with this split, doctors can usually fix it. But if the cleft isn't fixed, the baby can have serious health problems and a shortened life.\n\nIn the U.S. and other developed countries, corrective surgery is done when a baby is between three months and 18 months old. Surgical intervention is less common in less developed nations.\n\nDr. Albert Oh, a pediatric plastic surgeon, said he performs one or two corrective surgeries a week at Children's National hospital in Washington.\n\n\"We\u2019re one of the busiest centers in the United States, and so my partner and I, we average over a hundred primary cases per year.\"\n\n\n\nAbout one out of every 1,500 babies in the U.S. is born with a cleft palate. One out of every 900 babies is born with cleft lip. Babies of African descent have lower odds \u2014 one out of every 1,200 births.\n\nDr. Yang Chai at the University of Southern California said Asians are most at risk.\n\n\"If you look at a patient population worldwide, if you are Asian, the prevalence is about 1 out of 700.\"\n\nThese children are often stigmatized because of the way they look. But complications from a cleft lip and cleft palate go beyond the cosmetic. They impact speech and cause dental problems. A baby with a cleft palate cannot suck and is at risk of being malnourished. Malnutrition, in turn, causes stunted growth.\n\nDr. Ben Gitterman, a pediatrician who has worked as a volunteer in low-income countries to help these children, said the experience was life-changing.\n\n\"Seeing these kids and thinking, 'What a cute little 3 or 4 year old,' and finding that 3 or 4 year old was 7, 8 or 9. And because of the fact that they couldn\u2019t process food, they couldn\u2019t eat well. They had been so stunted ... by malnutrition. Not malnutrition from the lack of food in the community, but because they couldn\u2019t feed properly because of the cleft lip and palate situation. These were tiny little kids, and I was in shock.\"\n\nGitterman has volunteered numerous times with Operation Smile, one of the charities that organizes surgical missions to help these children. In a Skype interview with Dr. Bill Magee, Operation Smile's founder, Magee said his organization's mission has expanded in the more than 35 years of its existence.\n\n\"Up until about 1999, all of our volunteers pretty much came out of the United States. Today, 70 to 80 percent of our missions are done by local people in their countries that we have trained.\"\n\nCharitable organizations perform more than 80 percent of cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries in Vietnam, according to a 2016 study issued by Dr. William Magee III and his colleagues at the University of Southern California. Magee III is the son of the founder of Operation Smile.\n\nThe report showed how difficult it is for parents to get the surgery their children need in low and middle income countries. It's common in these countries for medical care to be paid in advance, which many families cannot afford.\n\nOperation Smile is working to change that.\n\n\"It\u2019s given us this incredible opportunity to understand how the infrastructure of surgery is so important ... and how to advance that infrastructure in countries all over the world,\" Magee said.\n\nAs for what causes this condition, genetic factors account for about 30 percent of cleft conditions. The mother's health is a contributing factor, but scientists are still searching for other causes with the hope of one day being able to prevent children from being born with cleft lips or palates."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Aid Group: 10 Worst Climate-Linked Disasters of 2018 Caused $85B in Damage", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/worst-climate-linked-disasters-of-2018-caused-85b-in-damage/4718180.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "From floods to extreme heat, 10 of the worst climate-linked disasters in 2018 caused at least $84.8 billion worth of damage, said a study released by the charity Christian Aid on Thursday.\n\nExtreme weather driven by climate change hit every populated continent this year, the British relief organization said, warning urgent action was needed to combat global warming.\n\n\"This report shows that for many people, climate change is having devastating impacts on their lives and livelihoods right now,\" said Kat Kramer, who heads Christian Aid's work on climate issues, in a statement.\n\nExperts say a warming world will lead to sweltering heatwaves, more extreme rainfall, shrinking harvests and worsening water shortages, causing both monetary losses and human misery.\n\nAlmost 200 nations are aiming to limit the rise in average world temperatures under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, though some warn progress to meet targets has been slow.\n\nThe 20 warmest years on record have been within the last 22 years, the United Nations said last month, with 2018 on track to be the fourth hottest.\n\nThe most expensive climate-linked weather events of 2018 were Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which caused at least $32 billion worth of damage as they slammed into the United States, the Caribbean and parts of Central America, the report said.\n\nThe United States also suffered at least $9 billion of losses from wildfires that caused dozens of deaths and destroyed thousands of homes in California.\n\nJapan was badly hit by severe floods over the summer, followed by the powerful Typhoon Jebi in autumn, which together caused more than $9.3 billion in damages, said the report.\n\nIt also cited droughts in Europe, floods in southern India and Typhoon Mangkhut in the Philippines and China among the most expensive climate-linked disasters of 2018.\n\nThe report's authors collated total cost figures using data from sources including governments, banks and insurance firms, though in some cases the figures only covered insured losses and also failed to take account of the human costs of such events.\n\nThey added that rising temperatures would continue to drive extreme weather events as they urged action to prevent further global warming which would impact the poorest and most vulnerable communities hardest.\n\n\"The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,\" said Michael Mann, professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State University, in a statement on the study.\n\n\"The world's weather is becoming more extreme before our eyes - the only thing that can stop this destructive trend from escalating is a rapid fall in carbon emissions.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "US Legal Marijuana Industry Had Banner Year in 2018", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-legal-marijuana-industry-had-banner-year-in-2018/4718174.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The last year was a 12-month champagne toast for the legal marijuana industry as the global market exploded and cannabis pushed its way further into the financial and cultural mainstream.\n\nLiberal California became the largest legal U.S. marketplace, while conservative Utah and Oklahoma embraced medical marijuana. Canada ushered in broad legalization , and Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court set the stage for that country to follow.\n\nU.S. drug regulators approved the first marijuana-based pharmaceutical to treat kids with a form of epilepsy, and billions of investment dollars poured into cannabis companies. Even main street brands like Coca-Cola said they are considering joining the party.\n\n\u201cI have been working on this for decades, and this was the year that the movement crested,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat working to overturn the federal ban on pot. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is all coming to a head.\u201d\n\nWith buzz building across the globe, the momentum will continue into 2019.\n\nLuxembourg is poised to become the first European country to legalize recreational marijuana, and South Africa is moving in that direction. Thailand legalized medicinal use of marijuana on Tuesday, and other Southeastern Asian countries may follow South Korea\u2019s lead in legalizing cannabidiol, or CBD. It\u2019s a non-psychoactive compound found in marijuana and hemp plants and used for treatment of certain medical problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the U.S. now. It\u2019s spreading,\u201d said Ben Curren, CEO of Green Bits, a San Jose, California, company that develops software for marijuana retailers and businesses.\n\nCurren\u2019s firm is one of many that blossomed as the industry grew. He started the company in 2014 with two friends. Now, he has 85 employees, and the company\u2019s software processes $2.5 billion in sales transactions a year for more than 1,000 U.S. retail stores and dispensaries.\n\nGreen Bits raised $17 million in April, pulling in money from investment firms including Snoop Dogg\u2019s Casa Verde Capital. Curren hopes to expand internationally by 2020.\n\n\u201cA lot of the problem is keeping up with growth,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal marijuana was a $10.4 billion industry in the U.S. in 2018 with a quarter-million jobs devoted just to the handling of marijuana plants, said Beau Whitney, vice president and senior economist at New Frontier Data, a leading cannabis market research and data analysis firm. There are many other jobs that don\u2019t involve direct work with the plants but they are harder to quantify, Whitney said.\n\nInvestors poured $10 billion into cannabis in North America in 2018, twice what was invested in the last three years combined, he said, and the combined North American market is expected to reach more than $16 billion in 2019.\n\n\u201cInvestors are getting much savvier when it comes to this space because even just a couple of years ago, you\u2019d throw money at it and hope that something would stick,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now investors are much more discerning.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, U.S. lawmakers see that success and want it for their states.\n\nNearly two-thirds of U.S. states now have legalized some form of medical marijuana.\n\nVoters in November made Michigan the 10th state \u2014 and first in the Midwest \u2014 to legalize recreational marijuana. Governors in New York and New Jersey are pushing for a similar law in their states next year, and momentum for broad legalization is building in Pennsylvania and Illinois.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s legalize the adult use of recreational marijuana once and for all,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week.\n\nState lawmakers in Nebraska just formed a campaign committee to put a medical cannabis initiative to voters in 2020. Nebraska shares a border with Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana, and Iowa, which recently started a limited medical marijuana program.\n\n\u201cAttitudes have been rapidly evolving and changing. I know that my attitude toward it has also changed,\u201d said Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat. \u201cSeeing the medical benefits and seeing other states implement it ... has convinced me that it\u2019s not the dangerous drug it\u2019s made out to be.\u201d\n\nWith all its success, the U.S. marijuana industry continues to be undercut by a robust black market and federal law that treats marijuana as a controlled substance like heroin. Financial institutions are skittish about cannabis businesses, even in U.S. states where they are legal, and investors until recently have been reluctant to put their money behind pot.\n\nMarijuana businesses can\u2019t deduct their business expenses on their federal taxes and face huge challenges getting insurance and finding real estate for their brick-and-mortar operations.\n\n\u201cUntil you have complete federal legalization, you\u2019re going to be living with that structure,\u201d said Marc Press, a New Jersey attorney who advises cannabis businesses.\n\nAt the start of the year, the industry was chilled when then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded a policy shielding state-licensed medical marijuana operators from federal drug prosecutions. Ultimately the move had minimal impact because federal prosecutors showed little interest in going after legal operators.\n\nSessions, a staunch marijuana opponent, later lost his job while President Donald Trump said he was inclined to support an effort by U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, to relax the federal prohibition.\n\nIn November, Democrats won control of the U.S. House and want to use it next year to pass legislation that eases federal restrictions on the legal marijuana industry without removing it from the controlled substances list.\n\nGardner and Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren have proposed legislation allowing state-approved commercial cannabis activity under federal law. The bill also would let states and Indian tribes determine how best to regulate marijuana commerce within their boundaries without fear of federal intervention.\n\nIf those provisions become law, they could open up banking for the marijuana industry nationwide and make it easier for cannabis companies to secure capital.\n\nBlumenauer\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d to legalize marijuana also calls for the federal government to provide medical marijuana for veterans, more equitable taxation for marijuana businesses and rolling back federal prohibitions on marijuana research, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe have elected the most pro-cannabis Congress in history and more important, some of the people who were roadblocks to our work ... are gone,\u201d Blumenauer said. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to jump-start it in the House, I think there will be support in the Senate, particularly if we deal with things that are important, like veterans\u2019 access and banking.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Japan to Leave International Whaling Commission; Resume Commercial Whaling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-to-leave-international-whaling-commission-resume-commercial-whaling/4717431.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Japan will withdraw from the International Whaling Commission and resume commercial whaling in July.

That's what makes this deep-freeze target so enticing; it's a preserved relic dating all the way back to our solar system's origin 4.5 billion years ago. No spacecraft has visited anything so primitive.\n\n\n\n\"What could be more exciting than that?\" said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University, part of the New Horizons team.\n\n\n\nLead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, expects the New Year's encounter to be riskier and more difficult than the rendezvous with Pluto: The spacecraft is older, the target is smaller, the flyby is closer and the distance from us is greater.\n\n\n\nNew horizons\n\n\n\nNASA launched the spacecraft in 2006; it's about the size of a baby grand piano. It flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the dwarf planet. With the wildly successful flyby behind them, mission planners won an extension from NASA and set their sights on a destination deep inside the Kuiper Belt. As distant as it is, Pluto is barely in the Kuiper Belt, the so-called Twilight Zone stretching beyond Neptune. Ultima Thule is in the Twilight Zone's heart.\n\n\n\nUltima Thule\n\n\n\nThis Kuiper Belt object was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014. Officially known as 2014 MU69, it got the nickname Ultima Thule in an online vote. In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world. When New Horizons first glimpsed the rocky iceball in August it was just a dot. Good close-up pictures should be available the day after the flyby.\n\nAre we there yet ?\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will make its closest approach in the wee hours of Jan. 1 \u2014 12:33 a.m. EST. The spacecraft will zoom within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Ultima Thule, its seven science instruments going full blast. The coast should be clear: Scientists have yet to find any rings or moons around it that could batter the spacecraft. New Horizons hurtles through space at 31,500 mph (50,700 kph), and even something as minuscule as a grain of rice could demolish it. \"There's some danger and some suspense,\" Stern said at a fall meeting of astronomers. It will take about 10 hours to get confirmation that the spacecraft completed \u2014 and survived \u2014 the encounter.\n\n\n\nPossibly twins\n\n\n\nScientists speculate Ultima Thule could be two objects closely orbiting one another. If a solo act, it's likely 20 miles (32 kilometers) long at most. Envision a baked potato. \"Cucumber, whatever. Pick your favorite vegetable,\" said astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins. It could even be two bodies connected by a neck. If twins, each could be 9 miles to 12 miles (15 kilometers to 20 kilometers) in diameter.\n\n\n\nMapping mission\n\n\n\nScientists will map Ultima Thule every possible way. They anticipate impact craters, possibly also pits and sinkholes, but its surface also could prove to be smooth. As for color, Ultima Thule should be darker than coal, burned by eons of cosmic rays, with a reddish hue. Nothing is certain, though, including its orbit, so big that it takes almost 300 of our Earth years to circle the sun. Scientists say they know just enough about the orbit to intercept it.\n\n\n\nComparing flybys\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will get considerably closer to Ultima Thule than it did to Pluto: 2,220 miles versus 7,770 miles (3,500 kilometers vs. 12,500 kilometers). At the same time, Ultima Thule is 100 times smaller than Pluto and therefore harder to track, making everything more challenging. It took 4 { hours, each way, for flight controllers at Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, to get a message to or from New Horizons at Pluto. Compare that with more than six hours at Ultima Thule.\n\n\n\nWhat's next\n\n\n\nIt will take almost two years for New Horizons to beam back all its data on Ultima Thule. A flyby of an even more distant world could be in the offing in the 2020s, if NASA approves another mission extension and the spacecraft remains healthy. At the very least, the nuclear-powered New Horizons will continue to observe objects from afar, as it pushes deeper into the Kuiper Belt. There are countless objects out there, waiting to be explored."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Source: Foxconn to Begin Assembling Top-End Apple iPhones in India in 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/foxconn-to-begin-assembling-top-end-apple-iphones-in-india-in-2019-source/4718218.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Apple Inc will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India through the local unit of Foxconn as early as 2019, the first time the Taiwanese contract manufacturer will have made the product in the country, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nImportantly, Foxconn will be assembling the most expensive models, such as devices in the flagship iPhone X family, the source said, potentially taking Apple's business in India to a new level.\n\nThe work will take place at Foxconn's plant in Sriperumbudur town in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the source, who is not authorized to speak to the media and so declined to be named.\n\nFoxconn, which already makes phones for Xiaomi Corp in India, will invest 25 billion Indian rupees ($356 million) to expand the plant, including investment in iPhone production, Tamil Nadu's Industries Minister M C Sampath told Reuters.\n\nThe investment may create as many as 25,000 jobs, he added. Another source also said Foxconn planned to assemble iPhones in India, in a move that could help both it and Apple to limit the impact of a trade war between the United States and China.\n\nThe Hindu newspaper first reported on Dec. 24 that the Foxconn plant would begin manufacturing various models of the iPhone.

If that goes ahead, it will be one of the biggest recent steps by a major company to secure an additional production base outside of China.\n\nFoxconn has previously admitted the China-U.S. trade spat was its biggest challenge and that its senior executives were making plans to counter the impact.\n\n\"Widening iPhone manufacturing in India through Foxconn will allow Apple to hedge the risk of any new U.S. trade policies,\" said Navkendar Singh, an associate research director at International Data Corporation.\n\nIndian taxes on import of devices and components have also heightened Apple's headache in a market where it has only a 1 percent share by smartphone shipments.\n\nMaking more phones locally will help Apple save costly duties and boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship drive to make India a manufacturing hub, Singh said.\n\nApple shocked investors last month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.\n\nFoxconn has previously expressed concern over demand for Apple's flagship devices."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "'Tech Addicts' Seek Solace in 12 Steps and Rehab", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-addicts-seek-solace-in-twelve-steps-and-rehab/4716812.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "We like to say we're addicted to our phones or an app or some new show on a streaming video service.\n\nBut for some people, tech gets in the way of daily functioning and self-care.

By early elementary school, he got his first Super Nintendo system and spent hours playing Yoshi's Story, a game where the main character searched for \"lucky fruit.\"\n\nAs he grew, so did one of the world's major tech hubs. Led by Microsoft, it rose from the nondescript suburban landscape and farm fields here, just a short drive from the home he still shares with his mom, who split from her husband when their only child was 11.\n\nAs a teen, he took an interest in music and acting but recalls how playing games increasingly became a way to escape life. \"I go online instead of dealing with my feelings,\" he says.\n\nHe'd been seeing a therapist for depression and severe social anxiety. But attending college out of state allowed more freedom and less structure, so he spent even more time online. His grades plummeted, forcing him to change majors, from engineering to business.\n\nAfter graduating in 2016 and moving home, he'd go to a nearby restaurant or the library to use the Wi-Fi, claiming he was looking for a job but having no luck.\n\nInstead, he was spending hours on Reddit, an online forum where people share news and comments, or viewing YouTube videos.

Clients \"detox\" from tech at a secluded ranch and move on to a group home.\n\nThey commit to eating well and regular sleep and exercise. They find jobs, and many eventually return to college.

Both councils are headed by the king\u2019s son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose powers, including roles as deputy prime minister and defense minister, were untouched in the overhaul.\n\nThe changes appear to further consolidate the crown prince\u2019s grip on power by appointing advisers and members of the royal family seen as close to him.\n\nAdel al-Jubeir, the soft-spoken foreign minister who took over the post in 2015 from the late Prince Saud al-Faisal , was replaced by Ibrahim al-Assaf, formerly a longtime finance minister. Al-Jubeir was appointed to the rank of minister of state for foreign affairs.\n\nAl-Assaf had been serving as a minister of state prior to being named foreign minister. He holds a seat on the boards of state-owned oil-giant Saudi Aramco and the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. The crown prince oversees both entities.\n\nAl-Assaf\u2019s biography on Aramco\u2019s website says he holds a Ph.D. in economics from Colorado State University, a master\u2019s degree in economics from the University of Denver and a bachelor\u2019s degree from King Saud University.\n\nThe changes, which impact several key ministries, come as the king and his son, the crown prince, were looking to announce a major reshuffle following Khashoggi\u2019s killing by Saudi agents in Istanbul.\n\nThe king issued a number of other royal decrees, which were read on state TV, that replaced the ministers of media and education.\n\nTurki Shabbaneh, a Saudi TV presenter, was named minister of media. Hamad al-Sheikh was appointed minister of education.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Abdullah bin Bandar\u2014 the son of Prince Bandar Al Saud who once served as Saudi ambassador to Washington\u2014 was named head of the National Guard. The force is tasked primarily with the protection of the Al Saud ruling family. Prince Abdullah had been deputy governor of Mecca.\n\nOne significant change impacts a close aide of the crown prince, Turki al-Sheikh, who was named as head of the kingdom\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, a body created in recent years to help organize and promote concerts and other events that had long been banned in the conservative country.\n\nAl-Sheikh, who is known to be close to the crown prince, was replaced as head of the Sports Authority by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal.\n\nAl-Sheikh\u2019s appointment as head of entertainment means he no longer oversees a cybersecurity and programming body that was led by Saud al-Qahtani, a close aid to the crown prince who was fired from his post and sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for helping to mastermind the plot in Istanbul that led to Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nKhashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, was killed and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nSaudi Arabia denies the crown prince knew of the plot. He\u2019s been supported by President Donald Trump who has touted U.S.-Saudi ties. The U.S. Senate, however, passed a unanimous resolution saying it believes the crown prince is to blame for the murder. His critics point to U.S. intelligence reports and say an operation like this could not have happened without his knowledge."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Indonesia Widens Danger Zone Around Anak Krakatau Volcano Following Tsunami", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesia-widens-danger-zone-around-island-volcano_us_5c24cb44e4b08aaf7a8e1045", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "CARITA, Indonesia (AP) \u2015 Indonesia raised the danger level for an island volcano that triggered a tsunami on the weekend, killing at least 430 people in Sumatra and Java, and widened its no-go zone.\n\nThe country\u2019s volcanology agency said Thursday that the Anak Krakatau volcano\u2019s alert status had been raised to the second-highest level and the exclusion zone more than doubled to a 3-mile radius.\n\nThe eruption on Saturday evening caused part of the island in the Sunda Strait to collapse into the sea, apparently generating tsunami waves of more than 6.5 feet.

The system, in any case, has not operated for years because the buoys have been vandalized or not maintained because of low funding.\n\nHeavy rains and high seas have hampered the search for victims.

Rents are likely to rise to market levels when these projects pay off loans and exit a federal rural housing program.\n\nBy Jan Pytalski\n\nRural America faces an affordable-housing crisis that, if left unchecked, could raise rents for low-income residents and contribute to rural population loss in coming years, said a national nonprofit organization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning that in rural housing, there is a crisis and people think that it\u2019s different than urban America,\u201d said Stephen Sugg, government relations manager at the Housing Assistance Council (HAC), which sounded the alarm during its biannual conference in Washington, D.C. earlier this month. \u201cIt looks different, but very high percentages of rural renters are paying over half their income in rent.\u201d\n\nHAC officials are worried about the future of an affordable housing program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that provides loans for buying or renovating buildings for affordable housing.\n\nUSDA\u2019s Section 515 Rural Rental Housing is among the few rental housing programs specifically for rural communities. The program started in 1963 and has financed more than 533,000 apartment units in nearly 28,000 different multifamily developments. HAC\u2019s data shows that 87 percent of all counties in the United States have at least one USDA property.\n\nBut the USDA program doesn\u2019t have enough funding to entice property owners to keep their properties in the subsidized rental market as the Section 515 mortgages mature. That means hundreds of thousands of rental units are scheduled to leave the USDA affordable housing program in the next 25 years. The result is likely to be steep rent increases for rural residents who can least afford it.\n\n\u201cThere are about 415,000 units still in existence in this program,\u201d HAC\u2019s CEO, David Lipsetz told the Daily Yonder at the conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cEvery single one of those units is on a time clock. Every single one of those units without some action to recapitalize the property is going to deteriorate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have these units, we have this stock,\u201d Lipsetz said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t fund it well enough to even keep what we have, we\u2019re going to continue to depopulate rural places.\u201d\n\nThe program supports mortgages for the builders of rental housing for low- and moderate-income families, elderly persons and persons with disabilities. After owners pay off the loans, they are generally no longer required to participate in rental programs for low- or moderate-income families. More than 90 percent of USDA\u2019s Section 515 portfolio is more than 20 years old.\n\nSource: Housing Assistance Council Nine out of 10 counties in the United States have rental units built through the USDA 515 rental housing program.\n\n\u201cWhen a USDA Section 515 loan ends for any reason, the property also loses its Section 521 Rental Assistance. Some properties are restricted to low-income use for a period of time after they leave the program. In instances where there is no restrictive use provision, owners may increase rents to levels their low-income tenants may not be able to afford,\u201d according to a HAC report.\n\nAbout 15,000 rental units will leave the program in 2028, if no changes are made in funding. That number will continue to grow through 2040, when more than 30,000 units will leave the program if property owners do not renew their participation.\n\nThe impact will likely be worst in the poorest counties, the HAC report says. Ninety percent of the nation\u2019s 395 persistently poor counties (defined as having poverty rates over 20 percent for the past 30 years or more) have Section 515 rentals. Subsidized rental units make up a greater share of the housing stock in those counties, as well.\n\nProtecting the housing stock for low- and moderate-income residents should be a priority for policy makers, Lipsetz said.\n\n\u201cThe leading edge social science research now tells us that housing is one of the most powerful predictors of your wealth, of your economic mobility, your educational outcomes and very importantly your health outcomes,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Brags To Troops About A Fictional Giant Pay Raise He Got Them", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lies-military-pay-raise-iraq_us_5c2441a0e4b0407e907fbc2b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "During his first visit to a combat zone since assuming office nearly two years ago, President Donald Trump couldn\u2019t help but take personal credit for a very generous and fictional pay raise for U.S. troops.\n\nThe president told service members at al-Asad air base in Iraq that he was proud to secure them a much-needed pay bump of \u201cmore than 10 percent\u201d after years of stagnant wages.

More than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one.\u201d\n\nIn fact, military members have seen a pay raise in each of the last 10 years, ranging from 1 percent to 3.9 percent, according to the Defense Department. They even saw pay bumps when other federal workers were subjected to a three-year pay freeze in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe pay increase for 2019 passed by Congress and signed by the president in August will be 2.6 percent, the largest since 2010. It is not far above last year\u2019s raise for troops, which was 2.4 percent.\n\nTrump told the troops that other people wanted their raise to be smaller, but he fought for a double-digit boost.\n\n\u201cWe had plenty of people that came up. They said, \u2018You know, we can make it smaller. We can make it 3 percent. We can make it 2 percent. We can make it 4 percent.\u2019 I said, \u2018No. Make it 10 percent.

As Politifact reported in May, the president claimed that the last pay increase, for fiscal year 2018, was also the \u201cfirst time in 10 years.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump used the phrase \u201cin more than 10 years\u201d four times.\n\nThe fact-checking site noted that the last single year without a military pay raise was 1983, and that was only because the date of the raise was shifted from Oct. 1 to Jan. 1.\n\nTrump headed to Iraq late on Christmas night to make his surprise appearance in front of the troops.

In 2013, Lystra sued her OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he had sexually harassed her.\n\nBy Barbara Feder Ostrov and Harriet Blair Rowan\n\nThe doctor instructed his patient to stand in front of him. He cupped her crotch and inserted his fingers into her vagina through her clothes, moving his hand repeatedly to her rectal area. Then he squeezed her breasts, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of California.\n\nThe patient, accompanied to the appointment by her 4-year-old granddaughter, asked why that was necessary to diagnose a urinary tract infection, according to the documents. He told her to let him do his job.\n\nIn three other cases, the board alleged that the family doctor, Ramon Fakhoury of California\u2019s Inland Empire, touched patients\u2019 genitals for no medical reason. In 2016, the board handed him 35 months of administrative probation, requiring him, among other things, to have a chaperone when treating females.\n\nFakhoury did not admit to the allegations, according to his attorney, and criminal charges against him were dropped. If he successfully completes probation next year, he\u2019ll be able to practice without restriction.\n\nWith a mission of patient protection and doctor rehabilitation \u2014 not punishment \u2014 California\u2019s medical board and those in other states make decisions under laws and norms that can seem discordant in the #MeToo era.\n\nCalifornia is often cited as one of the more rigorous states in overseeing doctors. But, according to the medical board, very few sexual misconduct complaints are reported to the board in the first place, historically under 200 a year. Even fewer result in a formal accusation against a doctor. And when discipline is found to be warranted \u2014 typically in fewer than 20 cases a year \u2014 the board tends toward leniency, sometimes granting a few years of probation even in instances of severe misconduct, according to a KHN analysis of medical board records.\n\nMore than a third of doctors sanctioned by California\u2019s board in cases that alleged sexual misconduct received probation in the past 10 years \u2014 some more than once. The terms of probation \u2014 which is not a criminal court action but places conditions on a physician\u2019s license \u2014 often required temporary chaperones, as well as psychotherapy and courses in \u201cprofessional boundaries\u201d and ethics. (Through probation, the medical board can only place conditions or restrictions on a doctor\u2019s license in civil proceedings; it does not take criminal court actions.)\n\n\u201cThey love giving second chances\u201d to physicians, said Marian Hollingsworth of San Diego, a frequent critic of the California medical board. \u201cIt makes you wonder where their priorities are \u2026 Their first loyalty is supposed to be patient safety and that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nThe recent, shocking reports about years of abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar and University of Southern California gynecologist George Tyndall \u2014 as well as national expos\u00e9s about physician misconduct by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Associated Press \u2014have only intensified concerns about whether sexual abuse is taken seriously enough in medicine.\n\nNassar, accused of abuse by scores of girls and women under the guise of medical treatment, is now serving what amounts to a life sentence. Prosecutors are considering criminal charges against Tyndall in more than 50 cases, and the state medical board has suspended his license while seeking revocation. He has denied the allegations.\n\nAnd just last week, 17 women sued Columbia University and its affiliated hospitals, alleging that the facilities engaged in covering up decades of sexual abuse by one of its OB-GYNs.\n\nResearch has shown that many doctors who sexually exploit patients, like other perpetrators of abuse, don\u2019t stop with one victim. They \u201cperpetrate such behavior for years before being stopped,\u201d said the authors of one study.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, California Gov. Jerry Brown in September signed landmark patient protection legislation requiring doctors who are on probation for sexual and other serious misconduct to notify patients of their status and the terms under which they must practice. It will take effect next July. The bill had failed twice before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said the bill\u2019s lead author, Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo). \u201cThe #Me Too movement has really made it very clear that there are individuals even in the most respected professions who abuse their authority.\u201d\n\nEven as sexual abuse complaints filed with the medical board rose significantly in the past year to coincide with the rise of #MeToo, board officials say they plan no major changes in how the board dispenses discipline in sexual misconduct cases.\n\nThe #MeToo movement \u201chas not changed us,\u201d said the board\u2019s executive director, Kimberly Kirchmeyer. Cracking down on sexual misconduct has always been \u201cone of the board\u2019s top priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nDigging into the records\n\nKHN examined all 135 cases of alleged sexual abuse investigated by the board that resulted in sanctions from July 2008 through June 2018. (The analysis did not include discipline based on proceedings in other states.)\n\nMore than a third of sanctions were for sexual misconduct with more than one victim, and the vast majority of alleged perpetrators were men accused of exploiting women.\n\nDoctors\u2019 licenses were revoked in 39 cases and voluntarily surrendered in 38. Several doctors received public reprimands \u2014 a minor sanction.\n\nThe largest share of sanctions \u2014 49 cases, or more than a third \u2014 were for probation.\n\nAccording to the board\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, the minimum probation period is seven years for a doctor found to have engaged in sexual misconduct \u2014 whether it is a sexual relationship with a patient, sexualized touching during exams or inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nBut those \u201cminimums\u201d were not applied in more than half of the probation cases, according to the KHN analysis. The guidelines allow exceptions based on \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d the age of cases, the quality of evidence and other factors.\n\nKirchmeyer noted that the board treats every case as unique and places a high value on a doctor\u2019s remorse and acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nIn eight cases, KHN found, a doctor sanctioned for sexual misconduct had previously been sanctioned for similar misconduct.\n\nDr. Patrick Mark Sutton, a Pasadena obstetrician-gynecologist, received probation twice \u2014 the first time for four years after investigators alleged sexual misconduct in 2002. In 2011, he was placed on probation again \u2014 this time for three years \u2014 following allegations that he improperly rubbed a patient\u2019s thigh and engaged in inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nHe denied all sexual misconduct allegations in 2002 and 2011, admitting only to medical record-keeping violations in both cases.\n\nThis September, after he had completed mandated ethics and \u201cboundaries\u201d courses, the medical board filed a new accusation against Sutton, saying that he had called a patient \u201chairy\u201d and asked the patient, who was naked from the waist down under a drape and in stirrups exposing her genitals: \u201cDo you enjoy orgasms? You are a very beautiful woman,\u201d according to the documents. That case is pending.\n\nSutton\u2019s lawyer, Gary Wittenberg, said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe allegations in the pending accusation are untrue and we will prove that in court.\u201d\n\nIn several cases, the board granted probation knowing the doctor had been convicted of misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse investigations.\n\nFakhoury, the Inland Empire doctor, had faced felony sexual abuse-related charges but was not convicted due to a hung jury, according to San Bernardino County Superior Court records.\n\nHis lawyer, Courtney Pilchman, told Kaiser Health News that the criminal charges were dismissed afterward and that the doctor \u201cdid not stipulate\u201d to \u2014 or admit to \u2014 the medical board accusation.\n\nBy contrast, Ohio\u2019s medical board, upon learning of California\u2019s sanction, in 2012 revoked his state license.\n\nThe number of disciplinary actions taken over the decade is strikingly small given the size of California\u2019s practicing physician population of more than 100,000. Alleged victims of sexual abuse by physicians are significantly less likely to come forward than sexual abuse victims in general, some research indicates.\n\nHowever, numbers provided by the medical board suggest that many of the complaints that are filed \u2014 whether by victims themselves or other sources \u2014 do not result in formal accusations against doctors. From October 2013 through June 2018, 838 complaints were designated by the board as possible sexual misconduct. During that same period, 74 accusations were filed. (Multiple complaints could be filed about one doctor.)\n\nExperts and lawyers familiar with the board offered various explanations: Some complaints may be false. Doctor sexual misconduct can be hard to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as required in medical board cases. Accused physicians often hire experienced lawyers who aggressively fight back, leading to delays and deals. Victims may decline to testify or present poorly as witnesses.\n\nSome victims, for instance, have psychiatric disorders or believe that they were engaging in a \u201cconsensual\u201d relationship, according to medical board documents.\n\nBoard staff have worked hard to treat alleged victims sensitively, Kirchmeyer said. Expert reviewers are instructed to read complaints as if the person is telling the truth, she said, and the board plans weeklong training sessions to help investigators work better with alleged victims and prepare them for testifying.\n\nThe cases often drag on. It can take years for victims to come forward in the first place \u2014 and more time for cases to wind their way through the state\u2019s complex bureaucracy. Evidence can go stale.\n\n\u201cPhysicians have to have due process,\u201d Kirchmeyer said. \u201cAnyone can make a complaint about anyone at any time.\u201d\n\nHeidi de Marco/KHN Tracy Lystra at her home in Aguanga, Calif.\n\n\u2018Slap in my face\u2019\n\nFacing what they see as an uphill battle, lawyers from the state Department of Justice, who handle administrative hearings, will sometimes pre-emptively recommend probation \u2014 even in serious sexual misconduct accusations \u2014 to avoid the possibility a doctor will get no sanction at all from a judge, said Laura Sweet, a former deputy director who retired in 2015.\n\nSweet, who worked for the medical board for 23 years, said the legal process focuses on the doctors and does not always give sufficient weight to the pain of alleged victims. \u201cYou\u2019re sending a message that\u2019s potentially minimizing what the victim endured.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Tracy Lystra sees it, too. In 2013, Lystra sued her Fallbrook, California OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he harassed her with comments about her body and how she aroused him, whispering into her ear as she lay on a gurney before surgery that she looked like a \u201csexy librarian.\u201d She said the case, which also alleged medical negligence, was settled for $150,000 in 2016. Bianchi, who could not be reached for comment, denied the allegations in court documents.\n\nThrough her attorney, Lystra filed a complaint to the medical board shortly after settling with Bianchi. This past July, she received a letter from the board saying it would not be able \u201cestablish grounds for discipline\u201d against Bianchi in her case, \u201cconsidering all the evidence and mitigating factors.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she learned that the board had received complaints from other women.\n\nIn 2014, Bianchi had been put on five years\u2019 probation after the board accused him of making inappropriate sexual remarks to two patients, telling one he dreamed of having oral sex with her and couldn\u2019t stop staring at her breasts. After learning of these cases, another woman came forward, alleging Bianchi several years earlier had blocked his office door with a chair, inserted his fingers into her vagina, exposed his penis and asked her for sex.\n\nThe board\u2019s penalty was another five years\u2019 probation. But the two probation terms overlap \u2014 and Bianchi, who agreed not to contest the allegations as part of the settlements in each case, could go back to work as an OB-GYN without restrictions in 2021. In the meantime, he is not allowed to treat female patients.\n\nLearning that Bianchi received such a light punishment \u2014 and that the board would not take action on her own complaint \u2014 was crushing, Lystra said, noting that it had been so difficult to get anyone, including her family, to believe her.\n\n\u201cI really wanted him stopped. It was so disappointing when medical board responded the way it did,\u201d Lystra said.\u201cIt was a slap in my face.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nIn its analysis, KHN requested every sanction for sexual misconduct issued by the Medical Board of California over the past 10 years, the name of each doctor involved and his or her license number. The board responded with 181 actions against 175 doctors from fiscal year 2008-09, beginning in July, through fiscal year 2017-2018, ending in June. (The records were designated by the board as primarily for sexual misconduct but often included other allegations.)\n\nKHN used the board\u2019s document lookup search on its website to review its available public records on each doctor. KHN mentioned sanctions outside the 10-year period when records showed the doctors were repeat offenders.\n\nThe analysis excluded cases in which the board took action in response to sanctions issued by other states\u2019 medical boards for sexual misconduct outside California.\n\nFor each sanction, KHN determined the number of alleged victims identified in the board\u2019s accusations, their gender, type of sanction, length and terms of probation, type of alleged sexual misconduct and whether the board took note of any previous or concurrent criminal proceedings.\n\nKHN also requested the number of complaints the board received alleging sexual misconduct, and how many formal accusations the board filed each year after the allegations were investigated and merited disciplinary action. The board did not have data for all 10 years, but provided the number of complaints received and the number of accusations filed from October 2013 through the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.
