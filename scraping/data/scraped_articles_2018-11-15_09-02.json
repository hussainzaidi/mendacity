The bad news is that the challenges and threats that are making his mood so dark are likely to get worse before they get better.\n\nThe President is angry at his rebuke from voters in the midterm elections. The oppressive prospect of action by special counsel Robert Mueller hangs like an immovable cloud over his White House. Staff chaos in the West Wing is producing lurid palace intrigue stories in the media that the President hates\n\nAbroad, he feuds with allied world leaders, and he's been so effective in implementing his \"America First\" policy that he's the odd man out at summits.\n\nAnd things are unlikely to improve quickly. Many legal observers expect new indictments to come soon in the Mueller probe, potentially bringing the investigation closer to Trump's inner circle in its final stages.\n\nDemocrats are prepping a barrage of investigations that will make life in his White House a misery -- from attempts to seize his tax returns and probe his business dealings to investigations into key policy areas like immigration.\n\n\"He's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is letting off steam where he can. He's feuding with a former friend, Emmanuel Macron, mocking the French President's approval rating (at 29%, it is lower than Trump's) and the French jobless rate of over 9%.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday, the President betrayed his disturbed equilibrium, claiming that voter fraud had cost Republicans key races\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again,\" Trump claimed, without evidence.\n\nNot the first President to feel this way\n\nTrump is not the first President to feel isolated, angry, rejected by voters or down in the dumps. Everyone who sits in the Oval Office feels that way sooner or later, though Trump's temperament is more volcanic than most.\n\nThe question for Trump is, what can he do -- other than a few restorative weekends on the golf course in Florida -- to improve his position ahead of a crucial period that will define opening chapters of his re-election campaign?\n\nOften when they are in trouble, Presidents engineer staff shakeups to bring in new ideas and energy. They go looking for wins in foreign policy, an area that pesky congressional foes can do little to disrupt.\n\nMore fundamentally, Trump could examine his entire political approach. While his strategy of division and tearing at cultural and racial divides helped him win the White House, it seemed to backfire in key House races. Failure to win back the suburbs could harm his hopes of winning a second term in 2020.\n\nIf Trump never gave another angry news conference or swore off explosive tweets, it's possible that his political situation -- and his 39% approval rating in the latest CNN poll -- would improve.\n\nAfter all he's kept many of his campaign promises. Unemployment is at its lowest point in half a century and economic growth is going gangbusters.\n\nAnd conservatives will thank Trump for decades for his two successful Supreme Court nominations.\n\nBut the President is so identified with convention-tearing tactics that it's probably impossible for him to change his style. It's probably too late as well, since he's made no effort to broaden his support base since taking office.\n\nTrump's tempestuous personality and unwillingness to be constrained also likely mean that another remedy available to other Presidents -- a hotshot new staffer to shake up operations in the West Wing -- is unlikely to work.\n\nHis first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, failed to impose order on Trump and was soon out the door. His successor, John Kelly, who is rumored to be on his way out, was soon drowned out by chaos.\n\nThe idea that Trump will look at election results, have some kind of political conversion and become a kinder, gentler President is also unthinkable.\n\nHe almost never admits he's wrong and he's been looking for people to blame for the GOP loss in the House.\n\nFor instance, the President listed GOP candidates who refused to accept his support -- or what he called \"the embrace\" -- at a post-midterm election news conference.\n\nA boost on the horizon?\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? 02:21\n\nSo what about a win on the world stage to boost the President's spirits?\n\nThere's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. US Middle East policy is in uproar since it's anchored on Saudi Arabia, which is being ostracized over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nStill, a breakthrough in a joint US and British diplomatic bid to end the war in Yemen would not just boost Trump's political prospects, it also would be a significant victory for humanity.\n\nTrump's hopes of a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have taken a dent, with Pyongyang angry at the lack of concessions by the US and new indications that it is pressing ahead with its missile program.\n\nLater this month, Trump will head to the G20 summit. Progress in defusing his trade war with China at his talks there with President Xi Jinping -- or even a ceasefire -- could be spun as a foreign policy victory.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet with Vladimir Putin at the summit in Argentina. But that's a potential political landmine, given allegations of Russian election interference that have produced unflattering media coverage of his chats with the Russian leader, which has infuriated the President.\n\nThe chances of significant wins at home also seem slim, given the gridlock that will descend on Washington when Democrats take the House gavel.\n\nBut Trump mused after the midterm elections that the new arrangements might be more conducive to deal-making than had a thin GOP majority materialized.\n\n\"This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't,\" he said.\n\nTrump seemed like someone trying to convince himself as much as the reporters in the room. But it's possible there is common ground on issues like prescription drug prices or infrastructure.\n\nThere was actually a ray of light on Wednesday when Trump had Democrats and Republicans to the White House to sign a bill that represents a small step toward criminal justice reform.\n\n\"Did I hear the word bipartisan?\" Trump quipped at the signing ceremony.\n\nOnce the Democratic subpoenas start flying, however, the room for compromise might shrivel.\n\nSo Trump will have one final option -- elevate an enemy -- a device he has effectively used throughout his political and business career.\n\nHe could choose to stage a showdown over a year-end spending bill to wring more financing for his border wall out of Congress. Though it's not clear that the possible government shutdown that could result would help him politically.\n\nThere is an argument that Trump will actually profit from lining up against a Democratic-led House next year -- especially if Nancy Pelosi, whose approval ratings are worse than his, gets her old job back as speaker.\n\nWhen 2019 dawns, a flurry of Democrats are likely to begin launching presidential campaigns, giving him an excuse to head out to the place where he always feels best: among his adoring throngs on the campaign trail."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump's mood takes a foul turn: 'He's pissed -- at damn near everyone'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TnNBKONJPPI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A political clobbering, bickering aides and now a public grenade launched across the White House by the first lady have placed President Donald Trump in a position he loathes: backed into a corner.\n\nA week after standing in the East Room and declaring victory in the midterm elections, the President is isolated and growing more furious by the day. He's openly speculating about replacing more members of his Cabinet , though so far has stopped short of executing the dismissals , leaving those aides in a career purgatory.\n\nAt an election night party at the White House, Trump left attendees guessing when he was spotted in a huddle with a potential replacement for his chief of staff, John Kelly, who himself stood awkwardly in a corner.\n\n\"Yes, he's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official said, noting the mood in the Oval Office is darker than normal this week. After nearly a month straight of campaigning before adoring crowds, the applause has gone silent and the President has retreated. The tempest has led to rampant speculation inside the building about the fates of other senior staffers, some of whom are beginning to plan their exits.\n\nFriends of the President describe him as embittered by the election losses and troubled by the Mueller investigation. He met Monday with his lawyers to go over a series of written questions from the special counsel. Some of his longtime confidants are worried for his health, believing he's gained weight and looks unwell.\n\nThe timing for the President's fury couldn't be worse, considering the White House is heading into uncharted territory with Democrats assuming control of the House. Trump has told some advisers he's itching for the fight, believing it can provide him a political foil. Meanwhile, special counsel Robert Mueller is inching closer to issuing his report on the Russia investigation.\n\n\"He knows it's winding up. So, it's unsettling,\" another person close to the President said.\n\nIt was a 24-word statement from the East Wing, where the first lady and her small staff work, about a presidential adviser that revealed how the dysfunction inside the White House is deeper and more tangled than previously known.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" a spokeswoman for Melania Trump said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nYet a day after that extraordinarily public rebuke, Mira Ricardel reported to work in the suite of offices in the National Security Council . After Ricardel was not even given the dignity of being named in the statement -- which referred to her only as \"she\" -- everyone in the West Wing was saying her name on Wednesday as anxiety intensified about what this latest feud would mean for the President's mood. Later Wednesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIn the last week, the President's frayed and fraught relationships have been laid bare for all to see: He's furious at Kelly for a Paris trip that ended in a public relations debacle. He's blaming his political advisers for losing the winning narrative of the midterms. And he was caught off guard by his wife's shot across the bow at one of the top advisers in the West Wing -- a sign that their private conversations clearly aren't functional.\n\nAfter his wife ordered the astounding statement to be released Tuesday afternoon, Trump was furious that what had been an internal staffing matter was now thrust into public view, leaving him to look like a bossed-around husband. The President's mood was dark and intense after what officials said was a blindsiding by aides who do not report to him.\n\nIf the sudden public interest in Ricardel, a behind-the-scenes operator, came as a surprise to the President, however, the underlying issues between her and the first lady's office were not new.\n\nThe Ricardel affair\n\nTwo sources said the first lady's office believed Ricardel accused members of their staff of inappropriate behavior as part of her trip to Africa last month, and asked for the White House counsel's office to investigate. The counsel's office declined, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's on top of concerns that Ricardel treated the trip dismissively and interfered with seating arrangements on the first lady's plane.\n\nIt became \"very personal\" to the first lady, one person familiar with the matter said, because she \"ran over Melania's staff.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said the first lady and her aides sought to take issue with Ricardel through \"appropriate channels\" for weeks, including Kelly, but nothing came of their concerns.\n\nOther officials said tensions between the first lady and Ricardel stemmed from more than just the deputy national security adviser's handling of her Africa trip, noting friction had developed over how Ricardel treated administration staff in general.\n\n\"It's true there was infighting between Mira and the first lady's staff. And it's true that the Africa trip was a big part of the tension,\" one person familiar with the matter said. \"But the reason the first lady asked for Mira to be fired was that the first lady believed she was a bully.\"\n\nThe episode came against the backdrop of broader tensions between the National Security Council and others in the West Wing who have bristled at the way national security adviser John Bolton has run his team. One senior White House official said some had viewed Bolton as more interested in serving as a personal adviser to the President than in running the day-to-day operations of the National Security Council.\n\nRicardel was Bolton's highest-ranking aide at the National Security Council, and her gruff style matches that of her boss. Both have made enemies within the administration for appearing to discard opposing opinions while advancing their own.\n\nBut when the first lady's office delivered its broadside against his top aide, Bolton was 10,000 miles away in Singapore on a trip with Vice President Mike Pence. Working against a 12-hour time difference, aides traveling with the national security adviser made furious calls to their colleagues back in Washington in an attempt to figure out what was going on and potentially stall Ricardel's firing. Bolton kept his head down, an official traveling with him said, and did not mention the drama publicly.\n\nMost viewed Bolton's efforts to preserve Ricardel's job as futile and just delaying the inevitable, which Bolton apparently realized after seeing the drama unfold from half a world away. But Trump had surprised staffers in the past, and there had been some speculation earlier Wednesday that Ricardel would end up in another position in the administration outside the National Security Council. The first lady does not offer the President staffing advice on a regular basis, but one former White House official said that when she does, it carries significant weight.\n\nPervasive dysfunction\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match 02:12\n\nThe episode underscored the dysfunction that continues to pervade West Wing staffing matters almost two years into the Trump presidency. It lays bare the continued factionalism pitting aides against each other, often in convoluted and unpredictable configurations. And it reflects the deep unease within the White House as Democrats prepare to launch an assault of investigations into all manner of administration business.\n\nStaffers are still coming to grips with the new political reality while responding to a freshly enraged President. The prospects for wide-ranging investigations launched by the new Democratic-led House have concerned aides, who worry about legal bills and the potential impact on their careers.\n\nA slow-rolling staff shake-up is far from over, with Kelly again the subject of rampant speculation, despite his proclamation earlier this year he would remain at Trump's side until 2020 . While the President has strongly considered Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff and an ally of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as a replacement for Kelly, there has been \"aggressive pushback\" against him, one senior official said. Some senior aides have even threatened to resign if Ayers is tapped for the job, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother name discussed inside the White House as a potential Kelly successor is Johnny DeStefano, a senior aide to Trump who has quietly taken over a growing portfolio. DeStefano, a former top adviser to then-House Speaker John Boehner, has a solid relationship with the President and is generally well-liked among the staff.\n\nBut the President, who detests the narrative that his White House is chaotic, could ultimately decide not to ax Kelly -- if only to spite the press.\n\n\"The more the press writes that John Kelly is gone, the more Trump is emboldened to keep him just to prove them wrong,\" one source close to the White House said.\n\nFraught workplace\n\nTrump's foul mood, meanwhile, has rendered the White House a tumultuous workplace where outbursts are becoming more common. The decision to scrap a planned visit to an American cemetery in France because of rain over the weekend only deepened the President's conviction that he's being misserved by some of his staffers.\n\nTrump was advised by deputy chief of staff Zach Fuentes, a close aide of Kelly's, just ahead of his tense meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron that he would not be able to fly his helicopter to the Aisne-Marne cemetery, situated 50 miles from Paris. A drive, Fuentes said, would cause traffic havoc around Paris, and would also make Trump late to the event -- something he detests.\n\nSome aides told the President that he should not worry about missing the event because he had other opportunities to pay respects on the trip, including another cemetery visit scheduled for the following day, according to people familiar with the conversations. Neither they nor the President expected the massive backlash the decision prompted, which sank in over the course of the following hours. As he watched the onslaught of headlines criticizing him for skipping the trip with no backup plan, the President took his anger out on Fuentes personally.\n\nWhiling away the empty hours at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, Trump complained the entire trip to France was poorly conceived and executed, according to people familiar with the matter. He'd long discovered the events on Sunday would not include a grand military parade like the one he witnessed a year ago on Bastille Day, leading him to wonder what the point of the trip was.\n\nInstead, Trump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nAs they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing. And they worked to set up phone calls with officials back home in the hopes of keeping him occupied.\n\nA brewing presidential tempest\n\nThe clouds started gathering on election night, people familiar with the matter said. Surrounded by his wealthy friends, three oldest children and select senior staffers, Trump entered a White House watch party a week ago in a cheerful mood. But as he huddled over pizza and tiny hotdogs with some of his billionaire friends, the President began to see things shift. His mood went south. And the blame began flying.\n\nHe did everything his political team asked him to do, Trump protested to his friends. He did his job while others clearly had not.\n\nKelly, the beleaguered chief of staff, attended early in the evening with his wife. Long viewed by the President as lacking political acumen, Kelly appeared out of his realm, according to two sources familiar with the scene. He remained in a corner sipping a drink with his deputy.\n\nAn hour before midnight, the President -- visibly annoyed -- announced he was done. The rooms, which had been set up with large televisions for viewing results, began to empty. As attendees began trickling out, some saw an intriguing sight.\n\nHuddled in a corner, intense in conversation, were the President, his wife and Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, who has been speculated about as a leading contender to replace Kelly.\n\nTo those still there who saw, and others who later heard about it, it was a moment the President appeared to stage."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "GOP senator: Protect Mueller or I'll stop Trump's judges", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ASG_jvbxSdI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Retiring Republican Sen.

Even as the meeting drew to a close, rumors swirled in Westminster that May could face a vote of no-confidence from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.\n\nDifficult decisions made\n\nBut on the steps of Downing Street, May seized the upper hand.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said in a statement on Wednesday that the party's \"desire for a deal will not be superseded by a willingness to accept any deal.\"\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in a tweet that he was \"pleased\" that a deal had been reached but that his government \"regrets\" the UK's decision to leave the bloc.\n\n\"I am pleased an agreement has been reached between EU and UK negotiators on a draft Brexit Withdrawal Treaty. While I welcome these developments, Brexit is not our policy and is something we regret. However, we respect the vote of the people of the UK.\"\n\nBut May insisted that she felt the draft withdrawal agreement was \"the best that could be negotiated.\"\n\nShe also made it clear that if Brexit-supporting MPs in her own party conspired to kill the deal, they could end up destroying their ultimate goal of leaving the EU.\n\nThe choice, she said, was stark: \"This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings us back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union; or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThat line was intended as a warning to rebels that if they vote down her deal, they risked precipitating a political crisis that could end with a second referendum.

The coming years will allow us to evaluate where we stand.\"\n\nThe excavations started in the area in 2013 and were centered on the rich Hellenistic and Roman burial sites surrounding the city, where archaeologists discovered nine new tombs this year.\n\nFindings from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the vicinity of Chiliomodi Credit: Greek Culture Ministry\n\nThe team, however, also excavated extensive building facilities in a 672-meter square area for the first time this year, which are believed to be remnants of the ancient city itself.\n\nKorka said that her team found key clues of the city's presence, including children buried in the foundations of walls. \"We found child burials; during the Roman times it was very strict where you bury the dead, and only babies were allowed to be kept inside buildings in the city -- all the rest had to be buried outside,\" she said.\n\nThe team also excavated a series of buildings, where they found organized rooms with housing facilities and door openings.\n\nInside the buildings, archaeologists found portions of clay, marble and stone floors, along with well-crafted walls, some of which were covered in mortar.\n\nBronze Age discovery: Is this Britain's Pompeii?\n\nThey also discovered a large storage jar, a pythamphorae, along with a 3.5-meter section of a long clay pipeline, believed to have been used for sewage.\n\nKorka said that researchers may have also uncovered the presence of an atrium, with architraves, columns and other architectural features located in the interior of the structures. The lead archaeologist described the city's construction as \"luxurious\" and noted that the buildings were \"very strong and very well done.\"\n\nThe ancient city of Tenea was founded approximately 9 miles south-east of Corinth and 12 miles north-east of Mycenae shortly after the Trojan war. The first inhabitants of the city are believed to have been Trojan prisoners of war, who were permitted to build their own town by Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, in the aftermath of the battle.\n\nKorka explained that the team discovered indications of the city's significant wealth, including 200 rare coins dating from early Hellenistic to the late Roman times.\n\nSeveral of these coins belong to the Emperor Septimius Severus (193-211 BC), which indicate that the settlement likely experienced particular economic growth during his dynasty.\n\nKorka said that her team will continue to excavate areas surrounding the current finds, and aim to slowly develop a topographical map of the city. The archaeologists will also focus on new branches of research, including exploring the effects of endemic diseases on ancient populations."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Death of 13-year-old fuels debate over Muay Thai kickboxing competitions", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/7U_wADNO--M/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Samutprakarn, Thailand (CNN) Anucha Tasako was just 13 years old when he stepped into the Muay Thai ring to fight a boy just two years older for prize money of around 2,000 Thai Baht ($60).\n\nHe'd done it almost 200 times before, but Saturday's fight was his last.\n\nAnucha died after being knocked unconscious and suffering a hemorrhage at his brain stem, according to Sub. Lt.

Tasako added the teen was \"very talented.\"\n\nHe first fought in the ring when he was eight years old, his uncle told CNN, winning his first match that came with a prize of 300 Thai Baht ($9). The prize money for his match on Saturday was 2,000 Thai Baht ($60).\n\nAnucha died as a result of a hemorrhage at the brain stem.\n\nAnucha wanted to train in Muay Thai because he wanted to earn money to buys things, said Tasako. To date, Anucha has taken part in an estimated 170 fights.\n\n\"His dream was he always wanted to be a champion at Lumpini Stadium or Ratchadamneon Stadium,\" he said, referring to the two main Muay Thai venues in Bangkok. \"Also, if he could he wanted to enter military cadet school.\"\n\nWhen asked about Anucha's death, his uncle said he didn't blame anyone. \"He died like a warrior. He was a fighter.\"\n\nA religious ceremony in honor of the teenager took place Wednesday in Samutprakarn Province, in central Thailand, where his final fight took place. His is body will be cremated Thursday.\n\nDamrong said that they had met his opponent, a boy two years older than Anucha, who paid his respects at the temple where the 13-year-old's body had been laid in repose.\n\nThe older boy had started boxing even earlier, at age 6. He told CNN he had his first paid fight just a year after that.\n\nAfter Anucha's death, he says he received a lot of vitriol on social media, but also enormous support.\n\nTo honor Anucha's memory, he's participating in the boy's cremation ceremony as a novice monk; Thais can temporarily join a monastery.\n\nHowever the death of his opponent has not deterred him from stepping into the ring.\n\n\"I want to continue on this road as a Muay Thai boxer, and see how far I can go,\" he said.\n\nShining light on the issue\n\nActivists and doctors have tried several times to amend the child boxing bill, but their attempts have never been successful, said Dr. Witaya Sungkarat, chief of the Thai Child Boxers Research Project at Mahidol University, adding that the news of Anucha's death has just shone a big light on this issue again.\n\n\"We have never recommended a total ban of Muay Thai boxing,\" said Sungkarat. \"But we want them to avoid hitting the head of the child until they are at least 15 years old.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHis institute has carried out research scanning the brains of children who take part in Muay Thai and comparing them against children who don't.\n\nThe result has clearly shown that brain development of kids who don't compete in Muay Thai are different from kids whose heads were hit in matches, said Sungkarat.

That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation,\" Zwingli said Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether a sensor on the outside of the plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.\n\nThe airline's claims come after Boeing was similarly accused Tuesday by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) of withholding information about the potential danger of the plane's new features.\n\nJUST WATCHED Families grieve at airport after plane crash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Families grieve at airport after plane crash 02:19\n\nLion Air Flight 610 crashed shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on October 29. Investigators believe the MAX 8 plane may have experienced problems with several sensors.\n\nBoeing said last week that a safety bulletin issued to aircraft operators in the wake of the crash was merely meant to reinforce existing procedures. Both Lion Air and the APA have now rejected the company's assertion.\n\n\"They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft,\" Capt. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the APA group, told CNN on Tuesday. \"The bulletin is not reaffirming, it's enlightening and adding new info.\"\n\nZwingli added that Boeing's safety bulletin did not suggest additional training for pilots operating that aircraft. \"We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" he said.\n\nZwingli said that if the result of the ongoing investigation -- conducted by Indonesia's National Transportation Commission, the US National Transportation Safety Board, and Boeing -- found that additional training was necessary, Lion Air pilots would undertake it.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Boeing spokesperson said in an email that it could not \"discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation\" and that the company had \"provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DOAAO) at the Indonesian Transportation Ministry told CNN that the agency was in the process of intensive discussions about additional training for the pilots who fly the MAX 8 planes, but did not elaborate on what any additional training would involve.\n\nOn Tuesday, the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the MAX 8 planes, \"the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft.\"\n\n\"What seems to have happened here is that a new version or a modified anti-stall capacity was added which pushes the nose down automatically. If it's true, it is beyond comprehension that Boeing did not tell the airline and pilots about this,\" said CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest.\n\nHe added that if important information hadn't been communicated to pilots, it would be a matter for aviation regulators, rather than individual airlines.\n\n\"The issue is how much information to give the pilots about the systems on board so they can respond in an emergency,\" Quest said, adding that pilots are often overloaded with readouts and signals from multiple devices and monitors that can risk distracting them at the worst possible moment.\n\nLion Air sensor replaced\n\nBoeing's operational bulletin, released last week, pointed airlines to \"existing flight crew procedures\" to address any erroneous readings related to \"angle-of-attack\" (AOA) sensors.\n\nAn AOA sensor is an instrument, similar to a small wind vane, that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later issued its own directive that advised pilots about how to respond to similar problems.\n\nLast week, investigators said the AOA sensor on board the aircraft had been replaced the day before the incident, but problems persisted.\n\nIndonesian authorities confirmed last Wednesday that the AOA sensor was replaced after a flight from Manado, in North Sulawesi, to Denpasar, Bali, on October 28. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 then made another flight to Jakarta that same day, and the pilots reported further problems.\n\nInvestigators said the jet experienced problems on its last four flights -- including, crucially, the flight that crashed, according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT).\n\nThe FAA's directive affects 246 Boeing 737 Max aircraft worldwide, with 45 of these operated by US carriers that include Southwest, American and United Airlines.\n\nVoice recorder still missing\n\nMore than two weeks after the crash, authorities are still searching for the plane's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which is believed to be buried under deep mud. If found, it should reveal what happened in the cockpit in the final seconds of the flight.\n\nInvestigators are already examining the flight data recorder (FDR) that was pulled off the seabed, some 30 meters under water, on November 1. Preliminary findings suggested there were problems with the airspeed indicator on the past three flights before the crash.\n\nThe airspeed indicator is like a speedometer and tells the pilot how fast the plane is moving through the air. It does this by gathering data from the plane's pitot tube and the static port, which essentially compare differentials in the air pressure to arrive at the plane's speed and altitude.\n\nAfter problems were reported with the airspeed indicator, the AOA sensor was replaced by a Lion Air technician in Bali before the plane departed for Jakarta on its penultimate flight.\n\nPassengers on that flight told CNN that the plane experienced a significant drop in altitude shortly after takeoff. \"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" passenger Robbi Gaharu said.\n\nOnce in Jakarta, a Lion Air technician checked the plane again and gave it the green light to fly on its final flight, from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "More than 100 missing -- most of them senior citizens -- in California's Camp Fire", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/ZMdjnvfjQuA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Paradise, California (CNN) Hundreds of people poured Wednesday into the Northern California communities ravaged by the deadly Camp Fire, searching for human remains while authorities tried to track down 130 people who are unaccounted for after the blaze.\n\nThe staggering death toll from the fire increased to 56 as eight sets of remains were found.\n\nMost of the people on the partial list of the missing posted earlier Wednesday on the Butte County website are senior citizens.\n\nThe majority of the missing live in Paradise, which is a town of 27,000 residents, many of them retirees.

But if its equipment is found to be responsible for it, PG&E \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" and that this could have \"a material impact\" on its financial results.\n\nThe utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, the company said in the SEC filing\n\nBut the fire is far from being under control, which means more damage is likely. PG&E said in the filing that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimates the fire won't be fully contained until November 30.\n\nThe damages alone could cost up to $6.8 billion. according to a report from Moody's this week.\n\nPG&E may not have enough to cover the cost that, let alone any legal fees or fines it might have to pay. The utility said in its filing that it currently has $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nShares of PG&E ( PCG ) plunged more than 30% Wednesday following this disclosure and were briefly halted for volatility.

Those bonds would help pay for damages tied to deadly California wildfires in October 2017 caused by faulty PG&E equipment.\n\nThe bill allows for the possibility that utilities could issue similar bonds for future fires, but that is not guaranteed.\n\nPG&E already faces one lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Camp Fire.\n\nA group of law firms that has dubbed itself the Northern California Fire Lawyers filed a suit Tuesday on behalf of Camp Fire survivors.\n\nThe firms allege in the suit that \"PG&E was negligent in failing to maintain its infrastructure and properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines.\"\n\nA spokesperson for PG&E told CNN Business that \"it's important to remember that the cause has yet to be determined.\"\n\n\"We are aware of lawsuits regarding the Camp Fire.

Kevin McCarthy was elected House minority leader Wednesday in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, putting the California Republican in position to lead House GOP members after Speaker Paul Ryan leaves Capitol Hill at the end of his term in January.\n\nThe vote was 159-43. McCarthy had faced a long-shot challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the co-founder of the conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nWith Ryan headed for the exit s, McCarthy, the current No. 2 House Republican, had long been viewed as the heavy favorite to become minority leader in the new Congress, the highest-ranking GOP leadership post with Republicans in the minority after losing control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.\n\nRyan announced in April that he would not seek re-election and had endorsed McCarthy , the House majority leader for the past four years, to be his successor.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the current No. 3 House Republican, was elected to the No. 2 Republican leadership position in the new Congress, where he will serve as minority whip. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was elected to the third-ranking position in the GOP hierarchy and will be the next Republican conference chair.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, McCarthy vowed to help the GOP win back the majority in the House and said Republicans will oppose Democrats if they target President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We will work with anybody across that aisle if they are there to work to move America forward. But let me be very clear, if their agenda is simply investigations, impeachment, and not focused on the hardworking American public, we will be there to defend the American public,\" McCarthy said.\n\nTrump and McCarthy have spoken about leadership races recently, territory that Presidents usually avoid so not as to seem like they're alienating members of their own party. In private conversations, the President pushed for Jordan and another close conservative ally -- Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina -- to have the top Republican positions on key committees, according to a source familiar. McCarthy doesn't dole out those positions -- that's for the House GOP Steering Committee -- but plenty of people on the Steering Committee are loyal to McCarthy and would heed his word. As of Wednesday afternoon it was not clear where Jordan or Meadows would land.\n\nMeadows told reporters on Wednesday that he believes Jordan has \"earned\" the spot of ranking member on the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"I think Jim has earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary, but that's not my call. That's going to be the Steering Committee's call, and certainly as we look at that they will be making those decisions after Thanksgiving,\" he said.\n\nPolitico first reported Wednesday that Trump has privately pushed McCarthy to make a deal with Jordan.\n\nA separate source confirmed to CNN that Jordan is interested in the ranking member position on the Judiciary Committee in order to check Democratic investigations that will be led by Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York.\n\nIn his race for minority leader, McCarthy positioned himself as a close ally of Trump. In a letter announcing his bid , he wrote, \"We need to lay the groundwork to regain the majority so that we can continue working alongside President Trump to fulfill our promise to fundamentally change Washington. I helped build a majority from a deeper hole than this and I have what it takes to do it again.\"\n\nAs minority leader, McCarthy will become the most visible face of opposition to the incoming Democratic majority. The next minority leader will have to decide whether and when the GOP minority might work to find common ground with Democrats and could also come under increased scrutiny from the President as the administration itself goes under a microscope in the new Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe leadership election comes as incoming freshmen lawmakers are in town for orientation.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, McCarthy said he does not believe that the President is to blame for House Republicans losing their majority, but he conceded that the party has work to do to improve its standing with voters, particularly in suburban areas.\n\n\"History is against us,\" he said. \"Any President in their first off-year election, on average, loses more than 30 seats.\"\n\nBut McCarthy added, \"We took a beating inside the suburban areas. We're going to have to work harder. I think our message is going to have to be clearer. Our ideas are going to have to be stronger. We realize that, and we will work toward that effort.\"\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump's mood takes a foul turn: 'He's pissed -- at damn near everyone'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/TnNBKONJPPI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A political clobbering, bickering aides and now a public grenade launched across the White House by the first lady have placed President Donald Trump in a position he loathes: backed into a corner.\n\nA week after standing in the East Room and declaring victory in the midterm elections, the President is isolated and growing more furious by the day.

After Ricardel was not even given the dignity of being named in the statement -- which referred to her only as \"she\" -- everyone in the West Wing was saying her name on Wednesday as anxiety intensified about what this latest feud would mean for the President's mood. Later Wednesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIn the last week, the President's frayed and fraught relationships have been laid bare for all to see: He's furious at Kelly for a Paris trip that ended in a public relations debacle. He's blaming his political advisers for losing the winning narrative of the midterms. And he was caught off guard by his wife's shot across the bow at one of the top advisers in the West Wing -- a sign that their private conversations clearly aren't functional.\n\nAfter his wife ordered the astounding statement to be released Tuesday afternoon, Trump was furious that what had been an internal staffing matter was now thrust into public view, leaving him to look like a bossed-around husband. The President's mood was dark and intense after what officials said was a blindsiding by aides who do not report to him.\n\nIf the sudden public interest in Ricardel, a behind-the-scenes operator, came as a surprise to the President, however, the underlying issues between her and the first lady's office were not new.\n\nThe Ricardel affair\n\nTwo sources said the first lady's office believed Ricardel accused members of their staff of inappropriate behavior as part of her trip to Africa last month, and asked for the White House counsel's office to investigate. The counsel's office declined, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's on top of concerns that Ricardel treated the trip dismissively and interfered with seating arrangements on the first lady's plane.\n\nIt became \"very personal\" to the first lady, one person familiar with the matter said, because she \"ran over Melania's staff.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said the first lady and her aides sought to take issue with Ricardel through \"appropriate channels\" for weeks, including Kelly, but nothing came of their concerns.\n\nOther officials said tensions between the first lady and Ricardel stemmed from more than just the deputy national security adviser's handling of her Africa trip, noting friction had developed over how Ricardel treated administration staff in general.\n\n\"It's true there was infighting between Mira and the first lady's staff. And it's true that the Africa trip was a big part of the tension,\" one person familiar with the matter said. \"But the reason the first lady asked for Mira to be fired was that the first lady believed she was a bully.\"\n\nThe episode came against the backdrop of broader tensions between the National Security Council and others in the West Wing who have bristled at the way national security adviser John Bolton has run his team. One senior White House official said some had viewed Bolton as more interested in serving as a personal adviser to the President than in running the day-to-day operations of the National Security Council.\n\nRicardel was Bolton's highest-ranking aide at the National Security Council, and her gruff style matches that of her boss. Both have made enemies within the administration for appearing to discard opposing opinions while advancing their own.\n\nBut when the first lady's office delivered its broadside against his top aide, Bolton was 10,000 miles away in Singapore on a trip with Vice President Mike Pence. Working against a 12-hour time difference, aides traveling with the national security adviser made furious calls to their colleagues back in Washington in an attempt to figure out what was going on and potentially stall Ricardel's firing. Bolton kept his head down, an official traveling with him said, and did not mention the drama publicly.\n\nMost viewed Bolton's efforts to preserve Ricardel's job as futile and just delaying the inevitable, which Bolton apparently realized after seeing the drama unfold from half a world away. But Trump had surprised staffers in the past, and there had been some speculation earlier Wednesday that Ricardel would end up in another position in the administration outside the National Security Council. The first lady does not offer the President staffing advice on a regular basis, but one former White House official said that when she does, it carries significant weight.\n\nPervasive dysfunction\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match 02:12\n\nThe episode underscored the dysfunction that continues to pervade West Wing staffing matters almost two years into the Trump presidency. It lays bare the continued factionalism pitting aides against each other, often in convoluted and unpredictable configurations. And it reflects the deep unease within the White House as Democrats prepare to launch an assault of investigations into all manner of administration business.\n\nStaffers are still coming to grips with the new political reality while responding to a freshly enraged President. The prospects for wide-ranging investigations launched by the new Democratic-led House have concerned aides, who worry about legal bills and the potential impact on their careers.\n\nA slow-rolling staff shake-up is far from over, with Kelly again the subject of rampant speculation, despite his proclamation earlier this year he would remain at Trump's side until 2020 . While the President has strongly considered Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff and an ally of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as a replacement for Kelly, there has been \"aggressive pushback\" against him, one senior official said. Some senior aides have even threatened to resign if Ayers is tapped for the job, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother name discussed inside the White House as a potential Kelly successor is Johnny DeStefano, a senior aide to Trump who has quietly taken over a growing portfolio. DeStefano, a former top adviser to then-House Speaker John Boehner, has a solid relationship with the President and is generally well-liked among the staff.\n\nBut the President, who detests the narrative that his White House is chaotic, could ultimately decide not to ax Kelly -- if only to spite the press.\n\n\"The more the press writes that John Kelly is gone, the more Trump is emboldened to keep him just to prove them wrong,\" one source close to the White House said.\n\nFraught workplace\n\nTrump's foul mood, meanwhile, has rendered the White House a tumultuous workplace where outbursts are becoming more common. The decision to scrap a planned visit to an American cemetery in France because of rain over the weekend only deepened the President's conviction that he's being misserved by some of his staffers.\n\nTrump was advised by deputy chief of staff Zach Fuentes, a close aide of Kelly's, just ahead of his tense meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron that he would not be able to fly his helicopter to the Aisne-Marne cemetery, situated 50 miles from Paris. A drive, Fuentes said, would cause traffic havoc around Paris, and would also make Trump late to the event -- something he detests.\n\nSome aides told the President that he should not worry about missing the event because he had other opportunities to pay respects on the trip, including another cemetery visit scheduled for the following day, according to people familiar with the conversations. Neither they nor the President expected the massive backlash the decision prompted, which sank in over the course of the following hours. As he watched the onslaught of headlines criticizing him for skipping the trip with no backup plan, the President took his anger out on Fuentes personally.\n\nWhiling away the empty hours at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, Trump complained the entire trip to France was poorly conceived and executed, according to people familiar with the matter. He'd long discovered the events on Sunday would not include a grand military parade like the one he witnessed a year ago on Bastille Day, leading him to wonder what the point of the trip was.\n\nInstead, Trump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nAs they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing. And they worked to set up phone calls with officials back home in the hopes of keeping him occupied.\n\nA brewing presidential tempest\n\nThe clouds started gathering on election night, people familiar with the matter said. Surrounded by his wealthy friends, three oldest children and select senior staffers, Trump entered a White House watch party a week ago in a cheerful mood. But as he huddled over pizza and tiny hotdogs with some of his billionaire friends, the President began to see things shift. His mood went south. And the blame began flying.\n\nHe did everything his political team asked him to do, Trump protested to his friends. He did his job while others clearly had not.\n\nKelly, the beleaguered chief of staff, attended early in the evening with his wife. Long viewed by the President as lacking political acumen, Kelly appeared out of his realm, according to two sources familiar with the scene. He remained in a corner sipping a drink with his deputy.\n\nAn hour before midnight, the President -- visibly annoyed -- announced he was done. The rooms, which had been set up with large televisions for viewing results, began to empty. As attendees began trickling out, some saw an intriguing sight.\n\nHuddled in a corner, intense in conversation, were the President, his wife and Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, who has been speculated about as a leading contender to replace Kelly.\n\nTo those still there who saw, and others who later heard about it, it was a moment the President appeared to stage."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Less than half of Democrats want Pelosi as the party's leader", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/XR1YaFQ3S6Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Almost three in five Americans said they'd prefer another Democrat as speaker of the House over past party leader Nancy Pelosi, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nAs Pelosi campaigns in the House to regain her title as speaker, Republicans and even some Democrats on Capitol Hill have mobilized against her.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at Jefferson Hospital in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Parents accuse CDC of not reporting children's deaths from polio-like AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/o2QBtMJhUpM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Moseley, Virginia (CNN) Parents of children who had a horrifying polio-like illness are accusing the Centers for Disease Control of hiding the deaths of two children who suffered from the condition.\n\nThe parents say by not publicly acknowledging the two deaths, the agency is intentionally downplaying the severity of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a disease that paralyzes healthy children in a matter of hours.\n\n\"I feel like they're just sugar-coating this,\" said Katie Bustamante, whose son Alex, age 6, died in May. \"It eliminates my trust in the CDC.\"\n\nTheir accusations come amid a wave of criticism from parents of children with AFM and from some of the CDC's own medical advisers. In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness, and 162 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "As more cases confirmed, CDC says evidence suggests 'viral association' for AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/E9Lz63t48Sg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There are 10 more confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis, a polio-like illness that mostly affects children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 in 27 states this year.\n\nThere are also 162 possible cases under investigation, 23 more than last week.\n\nAFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month, the CDC said that more than 90% of the 414 patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4, although adults can also develop AFM.\n\nThe agency released a report Tuesday that said 99% of children with confirmed AFM had experienced a viral illness with symptoms such as fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis.\n\nThe CDC also seems to be getting closer to determining a cause of the disease. According to the new report, \"Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic evidence to date suggest a viral association.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that the agency is \"not ruling anything out.\"\n\nIn the past two weeks, the agency has come under criticism from its own medical advisers for not zeroing in on a virus as a cause and instead also considering causes such as genetic disorders and environmental toxins.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany of the CDC's outside medical consultants have long thought that a virus -- specifically an enterovirus -- was most likely at the root of AFM.\n\nEnteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Though they're around all year long, they're most common in the summer and fall, which is also when AFM peaks.\n\nTypically, enteroviruses cause people to have cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and recovery is easy.\n\nSome of the patients whose cases are detailed in the new report tested positive for an enterovirus, but others have not, although it's not clear whether the testing was done in time to catch the presence of the virus.\n\nIt's unclear why a relatively small number of people develop paralysis after an enterovirus infection. Even within the same family, several siblings can develop the cold-like symptoms, but only one may become paralyzed.\n\nTwo weeks ago , four of the CDC's outside medical advisers on AFM expressed frustration to CNN that the agency insisted on casting its net wide, looking at genetic causes and possible environmental causes.\n\nThe experts felt that the agency shouldn't waste its time on those causes, which they said were highly unlikely, and instead should focus on a virus as the most likely reason behind AFM.\n\n\"I'm breathing a sigh of relief that they've acknowledged this,\" Dr. Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said of the CDC's new report. \"It's great.\"\n\nVan Haren said now the agency can move faster to figure out exactly which virus is causing the problem and how best to treat it.\n\nDr. Kenneth Tyler, a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM, agreed. \"I'm glad to see they're moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nBoth neurologists praised the CDC for becoming more communicative and responsive about AFM with doctors and patients over the past two weeks.\n\nJeremy Wilcox, a Virginia man whose son was diagnosed with AFM in September, also praised the agency for becoming more open.\n\nParents of children with AFM say that for years, their emails to the CDC went unanswered. Last week, Wilcox arranged a meeting between Dr. Anne Schuchat, the agency's principal deputy director, and more than a dozen parents of children with AFM. That meeting is taking place on Tuesday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Freakshakes contain \"grotesque\" levels of sugar, say campaigners", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/gt9K3m_NJAI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) It will come as no surprise that milkshakes loaded with sweets, chocolate bars, cream and cake, known as freakshakes, contain \"grotesque levels\" of sugar.\n\nBut now one campaign group wants them to be labeled with a nutrition warning and the worst offenders banned.\n\nAction on Sugar, based at Queen Mary University of London in the UK, conducted a survey of 140 drinks at UK fast-food chains and restaurants and found they contained \"alarming\" levels of sugar and calories.\n\nThe \"Unicorn Freakshake\" sold by UK restaurant chain Toby Carvery was the worst of those surveyed, containing more than six times the recommended daily amount of sugar for children between the ages of 7 and 10.\n\nAt 1,280 kilocalories it contains more than half the recommended 2500 calorie intake for an adult.\n\n\"An average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories!\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe drinks are popular on Instagram, where the general rule is that the bigger the tower of sugary items, the more delicious the drink.\n\nThe perfect cool down... pic.twitter.com/MegaWgyGE6 \u2014 Toby Carvery (@tobycarvery) August 22, 2018\n\nThe next worst offender on Action on Sugar's list was Five Guys' banana and chocolate shake with 1,073 calories -- the equivalent of more than four cans of cola. The fast-food chain also took third position for its cherry milkshake, which has 975 calories.\n\nResearchers considered products from 14 chains of restaurants and fast-food outlets. Others that were surveyed included Handmade Burger Company and TGI Fridays, both of which were among several companies that do not publish nutrition information about their shakes.\n\nBattling obesity\n\nThe UK has been battling the rising tide of childhood obesity, with almost a third of children aged 12-15 overweight or obese. This is not only associated with social and psychological problems but also a host of serious diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer.\n\nIn August 2016, Public Health England (PHE) set out its approach to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by launching a structured sugar reduction program to remove sugar from everyday products. All sectors of the food and drinks industry were challenged to cut sugar content by at least 20% by 2020.\n\n\"Despite milkshakes being incorporated into Public Health England's sugar reduction program as part of the government's childhood obesity plan, it is clear from our survey that much more needs to be done than a 20% reduction, said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar. \"These very high-calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffer from tooth decay -- that is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe group is urging health authorities to go further by calling for mandatory traffic light colored nutrition labeling across all menus. In addition, the group has called for an outright ban on the sale of milkshakes containing more than 300 calories per serving.\n\nAccording to the charity's research, nine out of 10 milkshakes sold in UK supermarkets would be eligible for a red label for the excessive level of sugar they contain. Nevertheless, these products contained far less sugar than the freakshakes sold in fast-food outlets.\n\n\"Milkshakes can contain significant amounts of sugar,\" said Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE in response to the report. \"The food and drink industry -- including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers -- has a key role in helping to tackle this by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nA spokesman for Toby Carvery said: \"Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children.\"\n\nThe chain is \"very mindful of our role in helping guests make informed decisions\" and makes public the nutrition information for its menu, the spokesperson said. The company has also committed to PHE's sugar reduction program.\n\nSpokespersons for Five Guys weren't immediately available for comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "US has highest rate of drug overdoses, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/heqqq5WGIE0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The United States has more than double the rate of premature overdose deaths of at least 12 other countries, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, says that there were an estimated 63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016 in the US.\n\n\"The U.S. has the highest death rate due to drug overdoses for both men and women (35 deaths in 100,000 men and 20 deaths in 100,000 women) in 2015, more than double those of any other country in our study,\" Yingxi Chen, one of the researchers and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute , wrote in an email.\n\nMexico had the lowest rates: 1 death per 100,000 men and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 women.\n\nThe researchers also found that the United States had the second-highest increase in drug overdose deaths: 4.3% per year in men and 5.3% per year in women, Chen said.

Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti arrested", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46217085", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:18", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Michael Avenatti rose to prominence as lawyer to porn actor and director Stormy Daniels\n\nMichael Avenatti, lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels in her suit against President Donald Trump, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, police in Los Angeles say.\n\nCelebrity news website TMZ said this followed a physical confrontation between the lawyer and a woman.\n\nHe denied the claim, and was later released on $50,000 (\u00a338,500) bail.\n\nThe lawyer represents Ms Daniels, who alleges she and President Trump had a brief relationship - a claim he denies.\n\nMs Daniels has sought to free herself from a non-disclosure agreement she signed before the 2016 election.\n\nIn a statement issued by his office, Mr Avenatti said: \"I have never struck a woman.

What happens now?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. A deal has been agreed by negotiators and the UK cabinet - it now has to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWhat has the cabinet agreed to?\n\nA draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the UK. It is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. Ministers have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.\n\nHave they solved the Irish border issue?\n\nThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nSo they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThat will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.\n\nThe backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nBut this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish sea.\n\nThe role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.\n\nTheresa May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nThey could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.\n\nWhat else is in the agreement?\n\nCommitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members\n\nA proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure\n\nA \"fair financial settlement\" from the UK - also known as the \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\"\n\nProtection for 3,000 \"geographical indications\" including Parma ham, feta cheese, champagne and Welsh lamb\n\nWhat about a trade deal?\n\nAlongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is a five page \"political declaration\" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like. This is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.\n\nThe political declaration envisages a \"a free trade area and deep cooperation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas\".\n\nThere would be \"ambitious customs arrangements\" that \"build on\" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nAn emergency EU summit will be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.\n\nAfter that, Theresa May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it - something the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December.\n\nMrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, have already said they are likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs have also said they will vote against it.\n\nThere has been talk of backbench Tories calling for the prime minister to stand down, and there could yet be resignations from the cabinet, with several known to have voiced concerns during their five-hour meeting in Downing Street. Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara, saying the agreement could lock the UK into the EU rules \"indefinitely\".\n\nWhen it comes to the crunch Commons vote, if the only choice presented to MPs is Mrs May's version of Brexit or no-deal, it could frighten enough waverers into backing her. That's what Downing Street will be hoping. Labour and some Tories are trying to ensure other options are put to the vote as well.\n\nIf she loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope she will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46209354", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright HoC\n\nTheresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons.

He ended with his first question - would MPs be presented with a choice between her \"half-baked deal\" or \"no deal\"?\n\nMrs May ignored this in favour of her customary swipe at Labour's economic policies and a defence of her Brexit agreement.\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford also went on Brexit, calling for Scotland to stay in the customs union.\n\nTory Brexiteer Peter Bone accused the PM of failing to deliver the Brexit people had voted for.\n\nThe prime minister hinted that a planned crackdown on betting machines in bookmakers shops could be brought forward - after protests from MPs on all sides and the resignation of Sports Minister Tracey Crouch.\n\nLabour's Rosena Allin-Khan called for another EU referendum.\n\nLabour's Wes Streeting called for stricter controls on the sale of crossbows.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nJeremy Corbyn was on fire today. A series of pointed, well-delivered questions, including one on whether the UK could unilaterally leave the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement, which the PM danced around but didn't answer.\n\nThe prime minister was in the awkward position of discussing an as yet unpublished and unagreed document, and she looked uncomfortable and, at times, cornered.\n\nShe endured a very tough three quarters of an hour against opponents whose position was far more fluid than her's could be. I think we saw Jeremy Corbyn's position evolving a bit, before our very eyes.\n\nHis warning that Labour would not accept a choice between the PM's Brexit deal or a no-deal Brexit opens up the prospect of an attempt to present some further option. But what? A new round of negotiation?\n\nPerhaps accompanied by an extension to the Article 50 deadline for Brexit?\n\nHis aside that Labour respected the referendum verdict would seem to rule out a call for a second referendum. A number of his senior colleagues are attempting to waft him towards a very soft Brexit position, and maybe more; today they got some Remain body language.\n\nEven more ominous was the intervention that followed from Conservative Brexiteer backbencher Peter Bone.\n\nHe normally wraps his political messages in a joke - this time he delivered a blunt, to-her-face warning that the PM's deal was unacceptable. It's the kind of attack from the benches behind that has failed to materialise at previous PMQs that may be a feature of future ones.\n\nThe prime minister fielded questions about other issues - the horrible crossbow murder in Ilford, rolling stock in Elmet and Rothwell, viaducts in Eddisbury, disabled veterans and many more, but the Brexit questions kept coming.\n\nSeveral MPs quoted departed transport minister Jo Johnson at her, and the questions he raised will not go away.\n\nThe PM could swat away outright calls for another referendum, but the SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, zeroed in on the idea that Scotland should have a similar customs union deal to that offered for Northern Ireland, an idea which alarms Scottish Tories, while Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts used a Brexit question to take a swipe at the Labour-led Welsh government in Cardiff.\n\nAnd at the end of it all a series of points of order established that the PM will probably be back tomorrow (Thursday) for a full-dress Commons statement on the deal - if it gets through Cabinet.\n\nThis was a mere appetiser for what promises to be a gruelling \"til they drop\" ordeal."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: DUP MP Sammy Wilson hits out at 'poor deal'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-46202568", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:00:43", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson reacted angrily to the government's Brexit text\n\nThe DUP has described the government's Brexit text as a \"poor deal\" after Prime Minister Theresa May announced the cabinet had voted to support it.\n\nEast Antrim MP Sammy Wilson reacted angrily to the news saying it was \"a deal she (Mrs May) said she would never accept\".\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds met the prime minister on Wednesday night.\n\nMrs Foster described the meeting as \"frank\" on a Twitter post.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @DUPleader We had a frank meeting tonight with the Prime Minister lasting almost an hour.

to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations.\n\nThe backstop within the agreed draft would avoid a return to a \"hard border\" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.\n\nThis has proven to be the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work.\n\nBut EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said agreement on the backstop would protect the Good Friday Agreement and respect the integrity of the UK as a whole.\n\nHe said the backstop would only kick in if there was no better solution by the end of the transition period

Mundell arrived in Downing Street for a cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell has backed the draft Brexit deal despite concerns about its impact on the fishing

in 2020.\n\nEarlier he was among 13 Scottish Tory MPs who wrote to the prime minister seeking assurances on fishing.\n\nAfter a much longer than expected meeting, Theresa May's cabinet collectively backed the withdrawal agreement, and the 585-page document has now been published along with a shorter document setting out the UK's future relations with the EU.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon described it as \"bad deal\" for Scotland and predicted she would struggle to get it passed in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Mundell told the BBC there had been a \"full and frank\" discussion at cabinet and they had agreed to move to the \"next stage\".\n\nHe said there would be a special EU council meeting, hopefully later this month, and the cabinet would then decide if to recommend the deal to parliament.\n\nAsked about rumours of a leadership challenge to Mrs May, he urged fellow Conservatives to back the prime minister.\n\nHe said: \"We need to support her going forward with the agreement, that's potentially been reached because the alternative to reaching this agreement is no deal, and no deal is an absolutely appalling outcome, not just for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Scotland's fishermen largely backed Brexit ahead of the referendum\n\nThe earlier letter to Theresa May from Scottish Conservative MPs came amid speculation that the UK's departure from the Common Fisheries Polices (CFP) could be delayed or watered down.\n\nThe CFP is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen who want the UK to be negotiating as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020.\n\nThe letter reminded the prime minister she had promised this would happen and that anything less than this would be a \"betrayal of Scotland\".\n\nIt went on to say: \"This has raised expectations in the fishing industry that Brexit will lead to complete control and full sovereignty over domestic waters that we must deliver on.\n\n\"In order to deliver on these expectations, we could not support an agreement with the EU that would prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares.\n\n\"That would mean that we would not be leaving the CFP in practice, and would become an independent coastal state in name only\".\n\nEU fishing vessels\n\nFollowing publication of the draft agreement the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) said it was seeking assurances that EU vessels will not be guaranteed continued access to UK waters in return for favourable trade terms.\n\nOn Wednesday evening the EU negotiator Michel Barnier said: \"An essential condition for the single customs territory to cover fisheries... will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nThe declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU makes clear that a new fisheries agreement will need to be negotiated.\n\nSFF president Bertie Armstrong said: \"Any linkage between access and trade contravenes all international norms and practice and is simply unacceptable in principle.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland 'concerns'\n\nMr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is on maternity leave, have previously written to Mrs May warning they would not support any deal that gave Northern Ireland a different arrangement to the rest of the UK on the single market and customs union.\n\nThey fear that making a special case for Northern Ireland while rejecting calls to do the same for Scotland would be a political gift to the SNP, and could fuel the case for independence.\n\nAsked about Northern Ireland, Mr Mundell said they continued to have concerns.\n\nHe said: \"We want to ensure that Northern Ireland remains fully part of our United Kingdom.\n\n\"We've always been very clear about that and we want to be satisfied that those arrangements in place for Northern Ireland that also respect the Good Friday Agreement and existing all-Ireland arrangements don't do anything to undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link":

It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that.\n\nAction on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough.\n\n\"These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving.\"\n\nRegistered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was \"shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it\".\n\nShe said it was \"time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products\".\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: \"The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFreakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon.\n\nToby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester.\n\nBoth companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes.\n\nA Toby Carvery spokesperson added: \"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes.\"\n\nAnd a Harvester spokesperson said: \"We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests.\"\n\nSupermarkets\n\nAction on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars.\n\nThe top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour.\n\nA spokesperson for Muller said: \"We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste.

It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table', so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been found under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

For many years now, one of the principal transit routes has been the dangerous sea crossing over the Mediterranean between Libya and Italy.\n\nImages of anxious people crammed into small and manifestly unsafe boats run by human traffickers have become sadly familiar around the world, as have the stories of sinkings and drownings that tragically are regularly attendant on these journeys.\n\nAs a result, and against a background of hardening anti-migrant sentiment in Europe, the problem of how to best respond to and control this phenomenon - and reduce the number of fatalities - has become ever more hotly debated.\n\nFor the last five years, EU navies have maintained a presence in the area to discourage people from making the journey. And since 2017, the Libyan coastguard, with the active support of the Italian government, has also become more active, mounting aggressive patrols off its long coastline.\n\nBoth the EU and Libyan authorities insist their actions save lives and disrupt the criminal networks that feed off the migrants' desperation. But their methods, focused mainly on deterrence, policing and security are increasingly at odds with those of other groups operating in the area since 2014 - NGOs running maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions to aid migrants in peril.\n\nIn August 2017, Italy asked all NGOs working in the area to sign a code of conduct, which in effect put strict legal and logistical constraints on their ability to operate.\n\nAs a result, by mid-2018, only four NGOs were left pursuing SAR missions in the Mediterranean and there had been a number of highly charged stand-offs with the authorities.\n\nIn March for example, after a tense altercation between Libyan coastguards and a vessel from Proactiva Open Arms involving 218 migrants and refugees, the NGO's ship was impounded in a Sicilian port for a month, with the crew held under investigation by the Italian authorities for allegedly \"conspiring to facilitate illegal immigration\".\n\nThen in June 2018, Italy refused to let the Aquarius - a ship run by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF (MSF) - disembark 600 rescued migrants in Italian ports. When Malta also declined to accept them it became a Europe-wide dispute.\n\nEventually, the migrants were off-loaded in Spain, but this and other incidents had a chilling effect on NGOs and for a time left the Libyan coastguard as almost the only rescue option in Central Mediterranean waters.\n\nMuch of the opposition to the NGOs' activities seem to stem from a belief that their presence encourages migrants to embark on journeys they would otherwise avoid, or even, in the words of Italy's controversial new Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, that they act as a \"taxi service\".\n\nThe NGOs reject this claim entirely, but it highlights the fundamental differences between humanitarian groups seeking to save lives on the open seas and those focused on trying to dissuade people from making the treacherous crossing in the first place. It also raises serious questions about the way that long-standing international maritime norms on nautical rescue are allegedly being ignored - with sometimes fatal consequences.\n\nWhat is clear is that when no one is available to help those in peril, lives will be lost.\n\nIn November 2018, the UNHCR said that more than 2,000 refugees and migrants have died on the Mediterranean route this year and that the number of drownings has escalated sharply.\n\nIn September alone, the refugee agency said one of every eight people making the dangerous journey towards Italy had been killed. This, it said, was due in part to the \"legal and logistical restrictions that have been placed on a number of NGOs wishing to conduct search and rescue (SAR) operations.\"\n\nWhile the agency acknowledged the efforts of the Libyan coastguard in saving lives where it could, it added that any vessel with the capability should be allowed to come to the aid of those in need. Moreover, anyone rescued in international waters should not be taken back to Libya where conditions are not safe.\n\nWith access to both sides, we sent filmmaker Paula Palacios to investigate the background to this complex debate and what may happen next.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Rohingya will not be forced back to Myanmar: Bangladesh", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/mounting-confusion-forced-rohingya-repatriation-myanmar-181115013128968.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled Myanmar, citing rape, murder and arson, will not be forcibly repatriated, Bangladesh's Rohingya Relief and Repatriation Commissioner has said.\n\n\"No one will be forced back to Myanmar,\" Abul Kalam told Al Jazeera.\n\nBangladesh is scheduled to send back an initial group of 2,260 Rohingya from 485 families on Thursday, in line with a bilateral plan agreed by the two governments in October.\n\nBut the move has been opposed by the United Nations' refugee agency and aid groups who say the Muslim minority can't be forced back, causing confusion over whether the repatriations will go ahead.\n\n\"They survived atrocities so it's natural they fear to go back,\" Kalam said.\n\nWhen asked whether the Rohingya would be guaranteed a \"safe and dignified\" return, Kalam said: \"Everything is done as per the agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar.

collective decision of the government was that the cabinet should agree to the draft agreement and the outlying political declaration,\" May said on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is a decisive step, which

Vietnam - Pham Doan Trang strums softly on an acoustic guitar. She's performing the Vietnamese folk song Water Ferns Drift Clouds Float Far. It's a song permitted by Vietnam's government. The authorities keep a close eye on any public performance.\n\nTrang, 39, now suffers when she plays the song. Not because of its moving lyrics or melody but because she can barely strum the chords. Last August, Trang was arrested along with 50 others at a concert in a Ho Chi Minh City teashop.\n\n\"They raided the concert. They said the singer was singing unpermitted songs,\" Trang said.\n\n\"They have a law that stipulates that every songwriter must register to perform and disseminate a song. That means if you compose a song and perform it somewhere without asking for permission, you are doing something illegal.\"\n\nWitnesses watched as police physically assaulted Trang who was seated in the audience. While in police custody, she sustained injuries to both hands. Many weeks later, bruises still cover her knuckles.\n\nShe was never charged with a crime but had her passport, phone and laptop confiscated.\n\nIt was not the first time Trang was arrested or assaulted. In 2015, she was participating in a protest against the felling of trees in the capital, Hanoi. Police descended on protesters and both her knees were broken.\n\nThis has left her with a debilitating limp.\n\n\"Since I became an activist, I [have been] attacked, physically attacked, many times by the police. Now I am disabled,\" Trang said, looking down at her hands, knees and mobility aid by her side.\n\n\"Once you learn about freedom, it's very hard for you to stop.\"\n\nCommunist mindset\n\nTrang is one of Vietnam's most prolific dissident writers. Her most recent book Politics for the Masses got her briefly detained earlier this year. It's a political primer for pro-democracy activists.\n\n\"Many people say this book can give me a prison sentence of 20 years. This book may give me a death sentence. It's a logical deduction,\" Trang said. \"I don't know what is their strategy or plan. I mean [a] status on Facebook may attract several likes, not hundreds or thousands, but people are still given 20 years [in prison]. I can't understand the mindset of communists.\"\n\nVietnamese environmentalist Le Dinh Luong had his 20-year prison sentence upheld last month - one of the longest handed down to an activist. He was convicted of \"attempting to overthrow the state\".\n\nVietnamese blogger Mother Mushroom - Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh - was released and sent into exile in the United States after serving two years of a 10-year prison sentence. She was convicted in 2016 of writing \"anti-state propaganda\".\n\nAmnesty International says there are at least 97 prisoners of conscience in Vietnam. Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson puts the total at more than 130.\n\nThis year alone, 55 Vietnamese activists, bloggers and Facebook users have been jailed, according to an AFP news agency investigation.\n\nMany Vietnamese believe the government uses political prisoners such as Mother Mushroom as bargaining chips to gain concessions from the US and, most recently, to improve trade relations with the European Union.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Le Cong Dinh served five years in prison and was released in 2014 because of pressure placed on Hanoi.\n\n\"After that the US agreed not to protest against Vietnam's involvement in the UN Human Rights Council. That's why I got out of jail. They tried to force me out of the country at the time but I rejected and decided to stay and keep fighting,\" he said.\n\nFacebook overthrow?\n\nFrom Facebook down to the Streets is a 2016 samizdat book by Pham Doan Trang. It raised the attention of Vietnamese authorities as it documented the country's nascent environmental movement.\n\nTrang is extremely careful with her online activity. She knows any comment she posts to Facebook could be used to prosecute her and send her to prison like many of her peers.\n\nVietnam's government has stated it employs a 10,000-strong cyber \"task force\" to monitor activists.\n\n\"What are they thinking? Do they actually think that people writing on Facebook can overthrow the administration?\" Trang asked.\n\nSince last June, nationwide protests against Vietnam's proposed Special Economic Zones and cybersecurity law have caught Hanoi off guard. Hundreds were arrested.\n\n\"Vietnamese Facebook users are close to 60 million,\" said Vi Tran, co-director of Legal Initiatives for Vietnam. \"Many large protests [against the government] around the country have started on Facebook.\"\n\nInside Vietnam, historically information flowed from the top down via state-run media, but with the rise of blogging and social media platforms now the news flows horizontally with bloggers and journalists writing and sharing news independently.\n\nReporters Without Borders' 2018 World Press Freedom Index ranks Vietnam 175 out of 180 countries - one point ahead of China. Freedom House says Vietnam is not free.\n\nBut unlike in China, access to Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter in Vietnam isn't blocked. Under its new cybersecurity law, the Vietnamese government requested these US tech companies to open offices inside the country to store its data locally.\n\nA song for freedom\n\nThe law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. Tech giants Facebook and Google have been given one year from this date to comply. Human Rights Watch has called it disastrous for freedom of expression in Vietnam.\n\n\"Observers are saying that the new cybersecurity law will give the government a tool to arrest more activists,\" lawyer Le Cong Dinh said.\n\nVietnamese civil society groups are concerned Facebook has begun to block or shut down accounts requested by the authorities. This move could silence many dissidents currently using the platform to share independent news and opinions.\n\n\"I just feel worried for other people. I'm so familiar with violent suppression and political repression,\" Trang said. \"But for other people, it's a real danger because now they can be arrested and given lengthy prison terms for a post.\"\n\nTrang is extremely worried about the deteriorating human rights situation in Vietnam. But she's optimistic about the peaceful, non-violent, methods used by her compatriots to express their dissatisfaction with the regime in Hanoi.\n\nIn the meantime, she'll continue her work offline.\n\n\"My hands are hurt but I can still type. I'm working on a new book. It's a legal handbook for people with imprisoned family members,\" Trang said. \"I may even write a song.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:14", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

The Miyun factory, covering about 100,000 square meters, has become a large production base for exports.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

But the novelty has generated more dislikes than likes online among Chinese netizens, with many calling the new virtual host \u201ca news-reading device without a soul.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the latest creation has showcased China\u2019s short-term progress in voice recognition, text mining and semantic analysis, but challenges remain ahead for its long-term ambition of becoming an AI superpower by 2030.\n\nNonhuman anchors\n\nCollaborating with Chinese search engine Sogou, Xinhua introduced two AI anchors, one for English broadcasts and the other for Chinese, both of which are based on images of the agency\u2019s real newscasters, Zhang Zhao and Qiu Hao respectively.\n\nIn its inaugural broadcast last week, the English-speaking anchor was more tech cheerleader than newshound, rattling off lines few anchors would be caught dead reading, such as: \u201cthe development of the media industry calls for continuous innovation and deep integration with the international advanced technologies.\u201d\n\nIt also promised \u201cto work tirelessly to keep you [audience] informed as texts will be typed into my system uninterrupted\u201d 24/7 across multiple platforms simultaneously if necessary, according to the news agency.\n\nNo soul\n\nLocal audiences appear to be unimpressed, critiquing the news bots\u2019 not so human touch and synthesized voices.\n\nOn Weibo, China\u2019s Twitterlike microblogging platform, more than one user wrote that such anchors have \u201cno soul,\u201d in response to Xinhua\u2019s announcement. And one user joked: \u201cwhat if we have an AI [country] leader?\u201d while another questioned what it stands for in terms of journalistic values by saying \u201cWhat a nutcase. Fake news is on every day.\u201d\n\nOthers pondered the implication AI news bots might have on employment and workers.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to production costs, which will determine if [we] lose jobs,\u201d one Weibo user wrote. Some argued that only low-end labor-intensive jobs will be easily replaced by intelligent robots while others gloated about the possibility of employers utilizing an army of low-cost robots to make a fortune.\n\nA simple use case\n\nIndustry experts said the digital anchor system is based on images of real people and possibly animated parts of their mouths and faces, with machine-learning technology recreating humanlike speech patterns and facial movements. It then uses a synthesized voice for the delivery of the news broadcast.\n\nThe creation showcases China\u2019s progress in voice recognition, text mining and semantic analysis, all of which is covered by natural language processing, according to Liu Chien-chih, secretary-general of Asia IoT Alliance (AIOTA).\n\nBut that\u2019s just one of many aspects of AI technologies, he wrote in an email to VOA.\n\nGiven the pace of experimental AI adoption by Chinese businesses, more user scenarios or designs of user interface can be anticipated in China, Liu added.\n\nChris Dong, director of China research at the market intelligence firm IDC, agreed the digital anchor is as simple as what he calls a \u201cuse case\u201d for AI-powered services to attract commercials and audiences.\n\nHe said, in an email to VOA, that China has fast-tracked its big data advantage around consumers or internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to add commercial value.\n\nArtificial Intelligence has also allowed China to accelerate its digital transformation across various industries or value chains, which are made smarter and more efficient, Dong added.\n\nFar from a threat to the US\n\nBut both said China is far from a threat to challenge U.S. leadership on AI given its lack of an open market and respect for intellectual property rights (IPRs) as well as its lagging innovative competency on core AI technologies.\n\nEarlier, Lee Kai-fu, a well-known venture capitalist who led Google before it pulled out of China, was quoted by news website Tech Crunch as saying that the United States may have created Artificial Intelligence, but China is taking the ball and running with it when it comes to one of the world\u2019s most pivotal technology innovations.\n\nLee summed up four major drivers behind his observation that China is beating the United States in AI: abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, growing AI expertise and massive government support and funding.\n\nBeijing has set a goal to become an AI superpower by 2030, and to turn the sector into a $150 billion industry.\n\nYet, IDC\u2019s Dong cast doubts on AI\u2019s adoption rate and effectiveness in China\u2019s traditional sectors. Some, such as the manufacturing sector, is worsening, he said.\n\nHe said China\u2019s \u201cstate capitalism may have its short-term efficiency and gain, but over the longer-term, it is the open market that is fundamental to building an effective innovation ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe analyst urges China to open up and include multinational software and services to contribute to its digital economic transformation.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s \u2018Made-in-China 2025\u2019 should go back to the original flavor \u2026 no longer Made and Controlled by Chinese, but more [of] an Open Platform of Made-in-China that both local and foreign players have a level-playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to a significant gap in core technologies, China\u2019s failure to uphold IPRs will go against its future development of AI software, \u201cwhich is often sold many-fold in the U.S. than in China as the Chinese tend to think intangible assets are free,\u201d AIOTA\u2019s Liu said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Migrants Reach US-Mexico Border, Likely Face Long Wait", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-reach-us-mexico-border-likely-face-long-wait/4659548.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Several hundred Central American migrants arrived Wednesday in the Mexican border city of Tijuana after a month of traveling away from poverty and violence at home in hopes of entering the United States.\n\nAbout 800 migrants are now in Tijuana, and many said they would stay there and wait for the rest of their caravan to arrive and for leaders to advise them on their options for seeking U.S. asylum.

Kevin McCarthy easily won an internal party election Wednesday to take over the shrunken House GOP caucus, handing the seven-term Californian a familiar role of building the party back to a majority as well as protecting President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nWith current speaker Paul Ryan retiring and the House majority gone, the race for minority leader was McCarthy's to lose. But rarely has a leader of a party that suffered a major defeat \u2014 Democrats wiped out Republicans in GOP-held suburban districts from New York to McCarthy's own backyard \u2014 been so handily rewarded.\n\nAfter pushing past a longshot challenge from Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy will be tested by Republicans on and off Capitol Hill who remain angry and divided after their midterm losses and split over how best to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe'll be back,\u201d McCarthy promised, claiming a unified front for the Republican leadership team. He won by 159-43 among House Republicans.\n\nMcCarthy, who has been majority leader under Ryan, acknowledged Republicans \"took a beating\" in the suburbs in last week's national elections, especially as the ranks of GOP female lawmakers plummeted from 23 to 13. The GOP side of the aisle will be made up of 90 percent white men in the new Congress \u2014 an imbalance he blamed on billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's election spending to help Democrats.\n\nBloomberg spent more than $110 million in the midterms. Two Republican women were defeated by candidates he supported, and both were replaced by Democratic women, said spokeswoman Rachel Nagler.\n\nExperienced\n\nMcCarthy has been here before, having helped pick up the party after Republicans last lost control of the House in 2006, leading them to the 2010 tea party wave that pushed them back into the majority.\n\nTrump, who is close to McCarthy but also friendly with Jordan, largely stayed on the sidelines in the intraparty House contest. The outcome gives the president two allies positioned to help him.\n\nWhile McCarthy provides an affable face for the GOP, Jordan, the former Ohio wrestling champ and a Fox News regular, will be fighting Democrats' investigations into Trump's businesses and administration.\n\nGOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was badly wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting and unanimously won his position Wednesday, said McCarthy \"knows what he needs to do.\"\n\nRounding out the GOP leadership team as House Republican conference chairwoman will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was on hand to watch his daughter take over the same No. 3 spot that he held decades ago. \"He told me not to screw it up,\" she said.\n\nHouse Democrats put off until after Thanksgiving their more prominent contest, California Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid to regain the speaker's gavel she held when the Democrats last had the majority.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky won another term leading Republicans and Chuck Schumer of New York won for Democrats. Both were selected by acclamation.\n\nSenate Republicans also welcomed the first woman to their leadership team in years, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, as they sought to address the optics of the GOP side of the aisle being dominated by men. Ernst called her selection as vice chairwoman of the Senate Republican Conference, \"a great honor.\"\n\nIn the House, Jordan and McCarthy shook hands after a testy two days of closed-door sessions, according to lawmakers in the room for Wednesday's voting. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the Freedom Caucus chairman, called it a \"gentlemanly\" debate.\n\nBut the friendly talk papers over the infighting between the GOP's conservative and moderate flanks as lawmakers dole out blame after the midterm election losses that handed House Democrats the majority.\n\nMany Republicans side with Jordan's theory, which is that Republicans, despite a GOP monopoly on power in Washington, lost because they didn't \"do what we said\" \u2014 including delivering Trump's priority to build the border wall with Mexico.\n\nStaying on message\n\nMcCarthy made that argument, too, lawmakers said, suggesting that those who lost their races \u2014 or came close to losing \u2014 didn't work hard enough to sell the GOP's message. At one point, ads featuring McCarthy were running promoting Trump's border wall.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter King of New York rose to object, saying his view was that Republicans lost ground over the GOP tax cuts that reduced deductions for some filers. The harsh immigration rhetoric that turned off suburban voters didn't help, he said.\n\n\"We used to own the suburbs,\" King said. \"Now we're down to rural voters.\"\n\nMcCarthy relishes an underdog role. \"We think he's absolutely our best political strategist, our best fundraiser, our best recruiter,\" said Rep.

That means the House would need to revote on anything the Senate passes.\n\nCriminal justice reform has been a priority of Trump's son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who has been working on the issue for months. Trump pushed for swift passage of the legislation, potentially during the lame-duck session of Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with a pen,\u201d he said.\n\nBut members still haven't seen the details, and time is running short.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. was cautious about the bill's prospects Wednesday. He told reporters that GOP leaders would do a whip count to gauge the bill's support once they have a final proposal in hand.\n\nStill, he noted the Senate has other things it needs to accomplish in the final weeks of the year, including funding the government and passing a farm bill. He said Republicans would have to see how the criminal justice bill \u201cstacks up against our other priorities\u201d once a final agreement is reached.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called Trump's announcement \u201can encouraging sign that we can achieve substantive reforms to our criminal justice system in this Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedemption is at the heart of the American Idea, and that's what this is about,\u201d he said.\n\nA White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking, said they hoped McConnell would hold a whip count after the Thanksgiving break. They also argued Trump's support would move lawmakers to back the compromise and that more would sign on once legislative text is released.\n\nThe bill is a rare bipartisan endeavor in a typically log-jammed Congress and has attracted support from a coalition of liberal and conservative groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and groups backed by the political donors Charles and David Koch. Critics say current sentencing guidelines are unfair and have had a lopsided impact on minority communities.\n\n\u201cDid I hear the word bipartisan?\u201d Trump joked during a Roosevelt Room event announcing his backing for the deal. \u201cDid I hear that word? That's a nice word.\u201d\n\nBut even as he hailed the cooperation, Trump couldn't resist a swipe at his former political opponents, saying the \u201cClinton crime law\u201d disproportionality affected black Americans.\n\nThe Senate package overhauls some of the mandatory sentencing guidelines that have been in place since 1994 legislation approved by Congress and signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton.\n\nDemocrat Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa released a joint statement, calling the endorsement \u201can important step in our shared effort to promote safe communities and improve justice.\u201d\n\nGrassley had said Tuesday the bill would be easier to pass after the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Trump last week. Sessions was a longtime opponent of criminal justice reform and had been especially wary of efforts to overhaul sentencing laws.\n\n\u201cI think we have a commitment from the Justice Department now to work with us on it,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nThe White House official called the timing coincidental.\n\nThe Senate approach would allow thousands of federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It would also lower mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses. The life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or \u201cthree strikes,\u201d would be reduced to 25 years\n\nBut roughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\n\nAll but two Republicans voted for the House bill when it was overwhelmingly approved in May, 360-59. Democratic lawmakers supported the bill by about a 2-to-1 margin, but opponents voiced concerns that it did not go far enough in giving judges more discretion to make the punishment fit the crime.\n\nThe House bill directs the Bureau of Prisons to conduct assessments for every offender once he or she is sentenced and to offer rehabilitation plans designed to lower the chance of recidivism. The plans would include vocational training, education, counseling and substance abuse treatment.\n\nThe federal inmate population has been on the decline since 2013, when it peaked at just more than 219,000. The total now stands at about 181,400, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Still, that's about triple the number of inmates in federal detention 30 years ago."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Official: Citizenship Query Will Not Cause US Census Undercount", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/official-citizenship-query-will-not-cause-us-census-undercount/4659413.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. Census Bureau's top scientist on Wednesday insisted the bureau can get a full count of American residents during the 2020 census, despite the Trump administration's addition of a question on citizenship.\n\nThe agency's chief scientist, John Abowd, made the comments in testimony in federal court in New York, where a group of U.S. states, cities and civil rights groups have sued the administration to remove the question, arguing it could dissuade non-citizens from participating in the decennial census.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a Republican, announced the citizenship question in March, saying it was needed to enforce federal laws against voter discrimination.\n\nBut plaintiffs say that is a pretext, and they want U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who is hearing the case, to strike the question.

If that process requires more effort than expected, he said, enumerators can simply work harder.\n\n\"There is enough capacity in the current cost model\" to \"adjust their workloads,\" Abowd said, citing a $1.7 billion contingency in the census budget.\n\nHe said the bureau will also rely on neighbors and existing government records to augment missing data.\n\nWitnesses for the plaintiffs previously testified that such methods will not produce a full count.\n\nAn economist and Cornell University professor, Abowd is among the trial's most compelling witnesses. Appointed to his Census role during the Obama administration, he advised against including the citizenship question earlier this year.

In fact, Ho said, Ross had decided months earlier that he supported its addition.\n\n\"From the beginning of the time I started my analysis through today, I'm just carrying out my obligations,\" said an emotional Abowd."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "JFK Twitter Account Aims to Show President's Words 'Count'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/john-f-kennedy-twitter/4659410.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Former President John F.

Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group, has trained veterinary staff in each of the countries where the mountain gorillas live.\n\n\n\nHunting in the national parks is illegal, but nearby residents still set traps to catch other animals, such as antelopes. Those traps can also grab gorillas' arms and legs.\n\n\n\nWhen gorillas are found struggling with snares, the vets are called in to clean wounds. Kirsten Gilardi, U.S. director for the organization, called it \"extreme conservation.\"\n\n\n\nOther experts said the emergency vet interventions play a significant role in maintaining mountain gorilla populations.\n\n\n\n\"It's a total conservation win, and there aren't that many of them,\" said Gilardi.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the IUCN also announced that bans on commercial whaling in the North Pacific Ocean and elsewhere had allowed some whale populations to rebound.

The musky incense swirled together with the smoke from orange-hot charcoals grilling whole sardines a few streets away.\n\nThe procession moved along, leaving behind just the smell of the sardines.\n\nIn this city, June is the month to celebrate the saints. Almost every neighborhood throws a party, known as an arraial.\n\nSome are just a scattering of makeshift tables in alleyways. Others cover several blocks and are jammed with tourists and locals alike. The saints are quickly forgotten in the din of pumping pop music, brass bands, chattering families, indiscreet lovers and flirty teens. The sardines are not. They're the star of every party.\n\nThe fish are so popular here, fisheries managers estimate that the Portuguese collectively eat 13 sardines every second during a typical June \u2014 about 34 million fish for the month.\n\nBut as climate change warms the seas and inland estuaries, sardines are getting harder to catch. Just a week before the festival, authorities postponed sardine fishing in some ports out of a fear that the diminishing population, vulnerable to changes in the Atlantic's water temperatures, was being overfished.\n\nIn the last few decades, the world's oceans have undergone the most rapid warming on record. Currents have shifted. These changes are for the most part invisible. But this hidden climate change has had a disturbing impact on marine life \u2014 in effect, creating an epic underwater refugee crisis.\n\nEffect on communities\n\nDrawing on decades of maritime temperature readings, fisheries records and other little-used data, Reuters has undertaken an extensive exploration of the disrupted deep. A team of reporters has discovered that from the waters off the East Coast of the United States to the shores of West Africa, marine creatures are fleeing for their lives, and the communities that depend on them are facing turbulence as a result.\n\nHere in Lisbon, the decline of the country's most beloved fish tugs at the Portuguese soul. A nation on Europe\u2019s western edge, Portugal has always turned toward the sea. For centuries, it has sent its people onto the sometimes treacherous oceans, from famous explorers like Ferdinand Magellan and Vasco da Gama to little-known fishermen who left weeping wives on the shore.\n\nThe St. Anthony's festival commemorates a 13th-century priest who, church doctrine says, once drew a bay full of fish to hear his sermon. It is the capital's biggest, most joyous celebration of the year.\n\nAt the bottom of the track where two bright yellow funicular trains begin and end an 800-foot vertiginous trip through the Bica neighborhood, a social club and a local cafe set up for the festival. Mostly locals were present, though a few German and French tourists have found their way to the party.\n\nFour friends sat around a wobbly plastic table perched outside the G.D. Zip Zip social club. There was just enough room for others to walk past and get to the homemade grill where the sardines were being cooked. Three of the friends had sardine skeletons and heads heaped on their plates. They talked about the fish that's as iconic in Portugal in the summer as a hamburger on the grill in America.\n\nThis year, however, because of limits on fishing, the available fish were mostly frozen.\n\n\"We listen to it all year round that maybe this year, we will not have sardines,\" Helena Melo said.\n\nFifteen feet up the hill, Jorge Rito, who has been cooking for the club every June for five years, wiped his watering eyes with the back of his hand. He'd just gotten another order and tossed a dozen whole sardines onto the grill in neat rows.\n\nAs he flipped the silvery fish, each seven or eight inches long, a burst of smoke rose from the charcoal, and he wiped his eyes again.\n\n\"Worried? Yes, of course,\" he said, removing the fish from the grill and placing them onto a platter. \"It is important for our finances, our economies, for us.\"\n\n\n\nYoungest sardines vulnerable\n\n\n\nJust as the next generation of humans may pay the highest price for climate change, the youngest generation of sardines is at risk.\n\nSusana Garrido, a sardine researcher with the Portuguese Oceanic and Atmospheric Institute in Lisbon, said larval sardines are especially vulnerable to climate change when compared with other similar pelagic species, such as larval anchovies, which are capable of living in a wider range of temperatures.\n\nDeep seawater upwelling dominates the waters off the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula and keeps the coastal waters cool. But small differences in temperature, especially when sardines are young, can have a significant impact on whether the fish larva dies or grows to maturity, Garrido said.\n\nOther researchers had tested how well adult sardines survived in a variety of conditions, and there was little evidence that environmental variables such as food abundance and water temperature affected the full-grown fish, she said. So she focused on the larval stage of the species.\n\n\"We did a bunch of experiments varying salinity and all of these other variables, and they survived quite well,\" she said. \"It was when you change temperature that everything, yes, fell apart. So they have a very narrow range of temperatures where survival is good.\"\n\nGarrido said a recently completed stock assessment showed that the larval sardine population was extremely low.\n\n\"This is getting very serious,\" she said.\n\nThe Portuguese sardine population started to fall about a decade ago, even though there were plenty of adults at the time to sustain large catches. And around the same time, southerly species, such as chub and horse mackerel, slowly moved in.\n\nChub mackerel, a subtropical species that was once found only in southern Portugal, is now caught all the way up the coast.\n\n\"Probably as a consequence of warming, it is now invading the main spawning area of sardines,\" Garrido said.\n\nLarger forces at work\n\nAlexandra Silva, who works down the hall from Garrido, has been managing the Portuguese sardine stock assessment since the late 1990s \u2014 pivotal work that the organization uses to decide the size of the sardine catch.\n\nWhen she started, the northern population of the species was in trouble following a period of strong upwelling that brought unusually cold water to the surface. The southern stock, however, was relatively healthy. And in the early years of the century, the species recovered.\n\nIt was not to last. These days, without large numbers of larvae growing to maturity, the population is near collapse all along the coast from Galicia in Spain to the southern end of the Portuguese coast.\n\nAll officials can do is cut down on the fishing. But larger forces, especially climate change, are now affecting the stock in ways that fisheries managers cannot control, the two said.\n\nRegulators have tried.\n\nStarting in 2004, they blocked fishing during the spring, when sardines spawn. And for a while, that seemed to work.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2011, the stock remained relatively healthy, with landings ranging from about 55,000 to 70,000 tons, even if the population seemed to be dipping. (From the 1930s to the 1960s, and as recently as the 1980s, fishermen landed more than 110,000 tons in a year.)\n\nIn 2009, the Portuguese proudly announced that the Marine Stewardship Council, an independent monitoring body, had designated the species healthy and sustainable. That year, Portuguese fishermen landed 64,000 tons of the fish. By 2012, however, that number had dropped to 35,000 tons, and the country lost its sustainable certification.\n\nSince then, fisheries managers have restricted the number of days a week that fishermen can catch sardines, as well as the size of the catch. They\u2019ve also restricted fishing to six months during a year.\n\nLast year, the catch was limited to about 14,000 tons.\n\nFurther cuts ahead\n\nEarlier this year, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, a forum of scientists that advises governments about fisheries management, warned that it would take at least 15 years to restore the stock at current fishing levels.\n\nAfter the report, European Union regulators permitted fishermen along the Iberian coast to continue at the current 16,100-ton level. But it also required Portugal, which gets the bulk of the quota, and Spain to submit a plan to restore the stock in October, which may well lead to further quota cuts.\n\nFisheries manager Jorge Abrantes handles landings for Peniche, a sleepy fishing town about 60 miles north of Lisbon. He doesn't think the fishing industry is the culprit.\n\nFor example, Portuguese government stock assessments indicated that the sardine population had decreased by 10 percent to 25 percent in just a few months. Abrantes argued that the dip clearly wasn't caused by fishermen pulling sardines from the sea, because no sardine nets were in the water during that period. Instead, he said, there are just not enough juvenile sardines to replenish the population.\n\nIn Peniche, fishermen Erbes Martins and Joao Dias sat among piles of nets on a bright but chilly February morning. The two 75-year-old men would have preferred to be fishing for sardines. But the fish were spawning, so they were not allowed to catch them.\n\nSure, there were other fish they could catch, but it wasn\u2019t worth it, they say.\n\n\n\nHorse mackerel, or carapau in Portuguese, one of the southerly species that now thrive all along the coast, is abundant but doesn't sell for much at market, Dias said.\n\n\n\n\"We can't fish for sardines in October, November, December, January, February, March \u2014 six months,\" Dias said. \"And carapau just doesn't pay the bills.\"\n\nHe said the restrictions on fishing sardines were keeping a new generation from going to sea, because they can't make enough money.\n\n\n\n\"When we die,\" he said, \"no one is going to do the work.\"\n\n\u2018I would miss this\u2019\n\nLisbon's Graca neighborhood sits at the highest point in the capital, its pastel homes looking down over the city's six other hills. For the St. Anthony festival, two stages were set up for music, along with about 20 temporary food and drink stalls.\n\n\n\nLuis Diogo Sr., his wife, Rita, and their two children, Luis Jr. and Vera, came out to join the party. Luis Sr. looked across a picnic table at his son, who was well into his third plate of sardines.\n\n\"This is a country between Spain and the sea, so we went to the sea very soon in our history,\" he said. The talk turned to the present, and the dwindling catch of the city's favorite seafood.\n\nLuis Jr. didn't pay much attention to his father. He was too focused on his sardines.\n\n\n\n\"I would miss this very much,\" the 17-year-old said, wiping his lips clean after polishing off the last sardine on his plate."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Experts Target Missing Link in Contraception: Men", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-target-missing-link-in-contraception-men/4658886.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Ask Esther Imaniragena to name her top challenge as she doles out contraceptive advice and supplies at a Rwandan health clinic and the answer comes short and fast: men.\n\nToo many men do not share the task of family planning, said Imaniragena, one of many birth-control champions who are deploying wily tactics to encourage burden-sharing.\n\nBe it cornering men after their wives give birth or touting a new type of \"model husband\" in a society that values virility, champions of birth control are trying new ways get men involved.\n\nIf they can find them, that is.\n\n\"The biggest challenge we have is males do not come,\" said Imaniragena, who runs family planning at the Rwamagana Health Center in the east of the country.\n\nPatients strolling the center's grounds on a recent day were overwhelmingly female, babies wrapped tightly to their backs and umbrellas in hand to protect against the fierce sun.\n\nGetting men on board has major benefits in developing nations that struggle with booming populations, a trend that puts pressure on limited resources and fuels fresh cycles of poverty, said experts, researchers and policymakers gathered at an international family planning conference this week in Rwanda.\n\nInvolving men increases contraceptive use, reducing infant and maternal mortality and the number of unwanted children. All of this frees up women for school or jobs.\n\nInsuring universal access to family planning by 2030 is among the global targets for sustainable development that were adopted in 2015 by the United Nations.\n\nThe experts said the key to success is to inform and involve men while preserving women's autonomy. And while some of the more creative efforts have worked, most schemes are localized and remain small-scale in the face of deep-seated resistance.\n\nOne way to find men\n\nTo target men, the Rwamagana clinic has started talking about contraception to husbands when they come to collect their wives after childbirth, Imaniragena said.\n\nIt is a start.\n\n\"We cannot say that they are involved as we wish, but this is the occasion to find them,\" she told visitors at the rural outpost, which was ringed by rice paddies, banana trees and fields of maize.\n\nThe results are impressive in terms of numbers reached. Last week, 15 out of 16 couples went home with newborns as well as family planning methods, according to the clinic, which serves more than 50,000 people. Most couples opted for hormonal implants or injectable contraception.\n\nThe effort mirrored a campaign launched two years ago in Benin whose focus was cutting child and maternal deaths, said Gisele Dunia of the University Research Co., a health care company working in the west African nation. Not only did the number of couples using family planning more than double within a year, but men would influence other men to do the same, she said.\n\nMale support 'generally low'\n\nAs of last year, four in 10 women of reproductive age in developing regions were using modern contraceptive methods \u2014 implants, injections and contraceptive pills \u2014 with rates ranging from two in 10 in Africa to half in South America and the Caribbean, according to research by the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission, a global group of experts, published this year in The Lancet, a medical journal.\n\nBut men's support for partners' sexual and reproductive health and empowerment \"is generally low,\" the Lancet report said.\n\nSuch support dips as low as 12 percent in Lesotho and climbs as high as 77 percent in Rwanda, it said.\n\n\"Women continue to shoulder the responsibility of contraceptive use,\" the Lancet report said. \"Given that men are often gatekeepers for women's access to services, involving men during pregnancy, childbirth and onward (when women want) can potentially increase gender equality and male support.\"\n\n'Not listening'\n\nThe best way to reach men in Uganda is to empower women, said Reuben Kizito of the Zaam Community Health Development Organization, which trains women and offers small loans.\n\n\"There are so many women out there who believe that the more children you give him, the more he loves, yet they are practically destroying themselves,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"So if we are in a position to empower them economically, then they are in a position to stop that habit.\"\n\nMen take little responsibility for family planning and think that pregnancy will keep other men away from their women, he said.\n\n\"When we have more women economically empowered, then the men will listen,\" Kizito said. \"Now they are not listening.\"\n\nMali runs a project that trains \"model husbands\" in local communities, organizers said, while programs in Togo are promoting \"positive masculinity\" for boys.\n\nIn the Philippines, a project called El Hombre \u2014 using men-to-men conversations \u2014 nearly doubled the rate of contraceptive usage where it was employed, said Jose Augustus Villano of the Commission on Population, a government agency.\n\nThose rates have dropped significantly since the 2016 election of President Rodrigo Duterte, he said. Duterte's policies and practices, including a war on drugs that has killed thousands of people, have drawn international condemnation."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Sentient Office Buildings Adjust to Workers' Personal Comfort and Well Being", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/sentient-office-buildings-adjust-to-workers-personal-comfort-and-well-being/4659437.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Office workers often complain that the building is either too hot or too cold.

But the novelty has generated more dislikes than likes online among Chinese netizens, with many calling the new virtual host \u201ca news-reading device without a soul.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the latest creation has showcased China\u2019s short-term progress in voice recognition, text mining and semantic analysis, but challenges remain ahead for its long-term ambition of becoming an AI superpower by 2030.\n\nNonhuman anchors\n\nCollaborating with Chinese search engine Sogou, Xinhua introduced two AI anchors, one for English broadcasts and the other for Chinese, both of which are based on images of the agency\u2019s real newscasters, Zhang Zhao and Qiu Hao respectively.\n\nIn its inaugural broadcast last week, the English-speaking anchor was more tech cheerleader than newshound, rattling off lines few anchors would be caught dead reading, such as: \u201cthe development of the media industry calls for continuous innovation and deep integration with the international advanced technologies.\u201d\n\nIt also promised \u201cto work tirelessly to keep you [audience] informed as texts will be typed into my system uninterrupted\u201d 24/7 across multiple platforms simultaneously if necessary, according to the news agency.\n\nNo soul\n\nLocal audiences appear to be unimpressed, critiquing the news bots\u2019 not so human touch and synthesized voices.\n\nOn Weibo, China\u2019s Twitterlike microblogging platform, more than one user wrote that such anchors have \u201cno soul,\u201d in response to Xinhua\u2019s announcement. And one user joked: \u201cwhat if we have an AI [country] leader?\u201d while another questioned what it stands for in terms of journalistic values by saying \u201cWhat a nutcase. Fake news is on every day.\u201d\n\nOthers pondered the implication AI news bots might have on employment and workers.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to production costs, which will determine if [we] lose jobs,\u201d one Weibo user wrote. Some argued that only low-end labor-intensive jobs will be easily replaced by intelligent robots while others gloated about the possibility of employers utilizing an army of low-cost robots to make a fortune.\n\nA simple use case\n\nIndustry experts said the digital anchor system is based on images of real people and possibly animated parts of their mouths and faces, with machine-learning technology recreating humanlike speech patterns and facial movements. It then uses a synthesized voice for the delivery of the news broadcast.\n\nThe creation showcases China\u2019s progress in voice recognition, text mining and semantic analysis, all of which is covered by natural language processing, according to Liu Chien-chih, secretary-general of Asia IoT Alliance (AIOTA).\n\nBut that\u2019s just one of many aspects of AI technologies, he wrote in an email to VOA.\n\nGiven the pace of experimental AI adoption by Chinese businesses, more user scenarios or designs of user interface can be anticipated in China, Liu added.\n\nChris Dong, director of China research at the market intelligence firm IDC, agreed the digital anchor is as simple as what he calls a \u201cuse case\u201d for AI-powered services to attract commercials and audiences.\n\nHe said, in an email to VOA, that China has fast-tracked its big data advantage around consumers or internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to add commercial value.\n\nArtificial Intelligence has also allowed China to accelerate its digital transformation across various industries or value chains, which are made smarter and more efficient, Dong added.\n\nFar from a threat to the US\n\nBut both said China is far from a threat to challenge U.S. leadership on AI given its lack of an open market and respect for intellectual property rights (IPRs) as well as its lagging innovative competency on core AI technologies.\n\nEarlier, Lee Kai-fu, a well-known venture capitalist who led Google before it pulled out of China, was quoted by news website Tech Crunch as saying that the United States may have created Artificial Intelligence, but China is taking the ball and running with it when it comes to one of the world\u2019s most pivotal technology innovations.\n\nLee summed up four major drivers behind his observation that China is beating the United States in AI: abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, growing AI expertise and massive government support and funding.\n\nBeijing has set a goal to become an AI superpower by 2030, and to turn the sector into a $150 billion industry.\n\nYet, IDC\u2019s Dong cast doubts on AI\u2019s adoption rate and effectiveness in China\u2019s traditional sectors. Some, such as the manufacturing sector, is worsening, he said.\n\nHe said China\u2019s \u201cstate capitalism may have its short-term efficiency and gain, but over the longer-term, it is the open market that is fundamental to building an effective innovation ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe analyst urges China to open up and include multinational software and services to contribute to its digital economic transformation.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s \u2018Made-in-China 2025\u2019 should go back to the original flavor \u2026 no longer Made and Controlled by Chinese, but more [of] an Open Platform of Made-in-China that both local and foreign players have a level-playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to a significant gap in core technologies, China\u2019s failure to uphold IPRs will go against its future development of AI software, \u201cwhich is often sold many-fold in the U.S. than in China as the Chinese tend to think intangible assets are free,\u201d AIOTA\u2019s Liu said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "US Lawmaker Says Facebook Cannot Be Trusted to Regulate Itself", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmaker-says-facebook-cannot-be-trusted-to-regulate-itself/4659508.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Democratic U.S. Representative David Cicilline, expected to become the next chairman of House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said on Wednesday that Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself and Congress should take action.\n\nCicilline, citing a report in the New York Times on Facebook's efforts to deal with a series of crises, said on Twitter: \"This staggering report makes clear that @Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers.\"\n\n\"It is long past time for us to take action,\" he said.

It is now the largest outbreak that the DRC has ever seen \u2015 with 341 probable and confirmed cases \u2015 and the third largest Ebola outbreak in history. And it\u2019s continuing to expand.\n\nWhile the risk of it spreading globally remains low, the threat for the country and its neighbors is very high. Constant incidents of rebel violence in the war-torn region, the resulting community protests and community resistance to medical intervention have hampered the ability of the World Health Organization, the DRC\u2019s Ministry of Health and various non-governmental organizations to respond.\n\nIn response to an Aug. 24 incident, the U.S. pulled response team members back from the epicenter in North Kivu to the DRC capital of Kinshasa hundreds of miles away. The American response effort is now concentrated in Kinshasa and neighboring countries, and U.S. officials said in a briefing Wednesday that the situation is currently too dangerous for them to go back to North Kivu.\n\nContainment efforts in this outbreak have also been made more difficult because a majority of the newest cases are not appearing among known contacts of other Ebola patients, said Dr. Peter Salama, the WHO\u2019s head of emergency response.\n\nIn fact, over the last 30 days, two-thirds of the reported cases of the infectious disease have come from unknown contacts, according to Pierre Rollin, a top Ebola expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s 85 cases out of 129.\n\nLast week, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, warned of the possibility of an \u201cendemic\u201d version of Ebola \u2015 where the virus is not extinguished but continues to spread over an indefinite period of time among the population of North Kivu. Public health officials have argued that everything must be done to prevent the horror of continuous transmission of Ebola \u2015 a situation that has never previously been seen.\n\nThis [Ebola outbreak] is going to get out of control fast. ... We are on the edge of crisis. J. Stephen Morrison, director of CSIS's Global Health Policy Center\n\nYet under a best-case scenario, Salama said the outbreak could be stopped within six months at the earliest. That\u2019s a significantly different assessment from that being made by the CDC.\n\n\u201cWhere we absolutely agree, this is arguably the absolutely most difficult context that we\u2019ve ever faced for stopping an Ebola outbreak,\u201d Salama told HuffPost. Global health leaders have had to re-evaluate many of the usual control tactics for battling the hemorrhagic fever, he said, because they\u2019re now dealing with a massive displaced population in a war zone \u2015 a situation that Salama has repeatedly described as a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d\n\nRon Klain, the Ebola czar under then-President Barack Obama, disagrees with that last characterization of a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d While Ebola has never been fought in a war zone before, he argues that this is the \u201cnew normal,\u201d not a one-off situation, in an era of increasing outbreaks of the highest risk.\n\n\u201cWe are going to increasingly see these disease outbreaks in troubled areas with histories of conflict, with refugees nearby, with difficult political situations because that\u2019s what more and more of the world itself looks like,\u201d Klain said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just treat this as some sort of flukish perfect storm of horrible facts that we\u2019ll just have to deal with this one time and not ever again,\u201d he said.\n\nSalama acknowledges that 80 percent of serious disease outbreaks are occurring in fragile state settings. And his more optimistic take on controlling the Ebola outbreak comes with this caveat: \u201cas long as the security holds.\u201d\n\nWar Zone Nightmare\n\nSince the outbreak began in North Kivu at the end of July, attacks by rebel groups and community demonstrations have hampered the public health response, repeatedly driving response workers into lockdown and stopping vaccination efforts and contact tracing.\n\nThere have been at least 20 major security incidents of various kinds since the start of the outbreak, including one this past weekend, Salama said at a briefing Wednesday morning at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). All of these incidents have \u201cset us back,\u201d he said.\n\nJeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow for the Washington-based Center for Global Development who previously led parts of the 2014 Ebola response for the Obama administration, stressed that no matter how effective the current response is, each rebel attack derails containment efforts.\n\n\u201cEvery time we\u2019re seeing one of these attacks, case monitoring is badly disrupted and drops off, people flee, and you see a corresponding increase in cases the following week,\u201d Konyndyk said. \u201cThat means no matter how much progress we think is being made, it\u2019s only as durable as the security situation allows it to be.\u201d\n\nRead more about the security situation in North Kivu here: \u201cExperts Said A War Zone Ebola Outbreak Would Be A Nightmare. It\u2019s Been Even Worse.\u201d\n\nThe violence has led to a wave of new cases that began at the end of September. U.S. government and WHO officials say there has been increased coordination with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a peacekeeping force has been deployed in the area for years. MONUSCO (an acronym based on its name in French) is the U.N.\u2019s largest peacekeeping mission, yet many are still concerned that the region\u2019s violence will continue.\n\nThe threat of further attacks and protests in the lead-up to what were already expected to be contentious presidential, regional and legislative elections in the DRC on Dec. 23 is worrying global health leaders.\n\nJ. Stephen Morrison, the director of CSIS\u2019s Global Health Policy Center who led a panel discussion at the think tank\u2019s event, told HuffPost that \u201cwe are kidding ourselves\u201d if people think the situation is going to improve soon.\n\n\u201cThis [Ebola outbreak] is going to get out of control fast. Just look at the pattern of ADF hits and our inability to stop it,\u201d he argued, referring to one of the two rebel groups responsible for the vast majority of the violence. \u201cWe are on the edge of crisis.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate fear \u2015 what Salama called a \u201cgame-changer\u201d \u2015 would be a directed attack against outside workers with the WHO or the NGOs who came to help. There have already been multiple attacks on local responders, including volunteers with the Red Cross, and two unarmed members of the DRC\u2019s Medical Immediate Response Unit were killed.\n\nSince the North Kivu region is currently labeled a Level 4 U.N. security threat, some sort of direct attack on outside medical responders would trigger a Level 5 label and result in evacuation of those forces \u2015 which would be catastrophic for efforts to contain the outbreak.\n\nThat\u2019s a frightening scenario, said Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, who is currently serving as the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s acting assistant administrator in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance.\n\n\u201cWe probably ought to be having a side meeting at a very high level to address what are the implications of that and what does that require all of us to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be blind and turn our back on this current challenge, as turning our back on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to go away,\u201d he added.\n\nZiemer previously served as the head of global health security at the National Security Council, which is coordinating the U.S. response to the DRC outbreak. Observers have argued that national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s decision to reshuffle that agency earlier this year diminished the power of global health security experts in the Trump White House.\n\nThe State Of U.S. Leadership\n\nWhile global health experts still commend the U.S. for its financial and logistical response to the outbreak \u2015 and credit it with the experimental but already invaluable Merck vaccine against Ebola, which more than 30,000 people have received in this outbreak alone \u2015 some wonder whether there is a new status quo in global health leadership.\n\n\u201cThey are leading from behind,\u201d said Klain, noting the U.S. deference to other stakeholders on issues of security and the on-the-ground situation in North Kivu.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same kind of leadership from the U.S. in a global health crisis that we have seen previously in Democratic and Republican administrations,\u201d Klain added, citing Obama\u2019s Ebola response and George W. Bush\u2019s efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa. \u201cFor an administration that likes to talk about \u2018America first,\u2019 their approach to Ebola has been \u2018America is one of many.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t be blind and turn our back on this current challenge, as turning our back on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to go away. Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, a senior USAID official\n\nThe fact that U.S. response teams aren\u2019t at the epicenter of the outbreak now is reflective of a \u201cBenghazi hangover,\u201d Konyndyk argued, suggesting that no one in the current administration who is focused on the outbreak has enough influence to lobby Bolton, much less President Donald Trump, on this critical issue.\n\n\u201cThere is no substitute for being there,\u201d Konyndyk said.\n\nThe lack of an overarching global leadership beside the WHO is also concerning to him. \u201cAt a certain point, a response becomes more complex than what WHO can manage on its own,\u201d Konyndyk said.\n\nIndeed, during the 2014 West Africa outbreak, the WHO was excoriated for its foot-dragging. U.S. attention and resources were ultimately pivotal to ramping up the global response. And still, that epidemic killed 11,300 and infected 28,600 more.\n\nMorrison hopes that global leaders aren\u2019t fretting away the time like they did from February to August 2014 before taking definitive action.\n\nAt The Ebola Epicenter\n\nIn the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Beni, the spread of Ebola has been driven by transmission of the illness in the \u201ctradi-modern\u201d facilities, according to Salama. Practices in these 300 or so health care centers, which combine traditional healing with modern medicine, are not optimal. Workers are reusing needles and there are no records of whom they treat.\n\nA concurrent malaria outbreak is driving many \u2015 especially children \u2015 to the health centers. The WHO theory is that there they come into contact with infectious Ebola patients or are given injectables with the same needles used on Ebola patients. Without records, tracing contacts among the population of those exposed through the tradi-modern system is extremely difficult.\n\nThat\u2019s a critical insight about the spread of the disease, but the WHO first suggested it almost a month ago to STAT. Given all the other challenges of fighting Ebola in an unstable urban community of 200,000 people, it\u2019s not clear this theory is enough to quell the outbreak anytime soon.\n\nKlain said it also sounds like something he\u2019s spotted over the last few weeks in the WHO\u2019s public statements: \u201cthe beginning of a hint of excuse-making.\u201d That\u2019s a shame, he said, considering the organization has made massive strides since its fatally slow response in 2014 and that until recently it \u201cshould be commended\u201d for its forthrightness about the severity of the DRC situation.\n\nThe bottom line is that this Ebola outbreak is still expanding, not contracting, into new areas \u2015 a total of 14 health zones of significant geographic size, as of Wednesday\u2019s Ministry of Health report \u2015 and infecting new, unidentified people.\n\n\u201cRight now, the position of global public health authorities should be we have an outbreak that is spreading in every conceivable way it can spread and we don\u2019t have a grip on it,\u201d Klain said. \u201cAnd until you have a grip on it, you just don\u2019t.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Are Gummy Vitamins Even Good For You?

So it\u2019s no surprise that gummy products now account for $1 billion of the $41 billion supplement market in the United States, a more than 25 percent increase from 2015, according to IBISWorld, a research company.\n\nBut are they equally effective?\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that one form of vitamin is superior to another, according to Zhaoping Li, a professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nShe acknowledged that people are often skeptical about the ingredients used in gummy vitamins. \u201cGummy is made of gelatin,\u201d Li said. \u201cThey also often have other things in it \u2014 glucose or glucose syrup. They often have to add food coloring. And citric acid to keep it stable.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, she added, vitamin gummies, pills or tablets often undergo chemical processing, with added \u201cinactive\u201d materials that help to shape the vitamin into its form. \u201cWe could find out the same concerns \u2026 with tablets as what we\u2019re worried about with gummy vitamins,\u201d Li said.\n\nThat being said, there are some points you should consider as you choose vitamins from the shelves of your local drugstore. Below are some things experts want you to keep in mind about gummy supplements and vitamins in general.\n\nBe aware of gummy vitamins\u2019 added sugar\n\nWachara Kireewong / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nGummy vitamins are typically made with added sugar. It\u2019s one of the reasons they\u2019re so tasty, but it\u2019s also one of the reasons some consumers are hesitant to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nWhether added sugar in your gummy vitamins is cause for concern depends on the amount, said Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author of Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You From Label to Table. As a frame of reference, she said a packet of sugar has 4 grams of sugar. In comparison, if a gummy multivitamin had 3 grams of sugar and provided the vitamins your body needed, the generally low sugar content wouldn\u2019t be concerning. It\u2019s best to look at your sugar intake as a whole, Taub-Dix advised. Less than 10 percent of your calories each day should come from added sugars, according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 200 calories, or about 12 teaspoons, for a 2,000-calorie diet,\u201d Taub-Dix said, adding that some people may need more or less than 2,000 calories a day, depending on their health and activity level.\n\nCalories from sugar can add up quickly, too, she noted, especially if you consume yogurt, cereal, coffee drinks, sauces and salad dressings. High-sugar diets can lead to higher blood pressure, weight gain, diabetes and fatty liver disease, all of which have been linked to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo you wouldn\u2019t want to take a combination of gummy vitamins that are equivalent to 16 grams of added sugar, Taub-Dix said, which could add up to 4 teaspoons of sugar coming from your vitamins alone. And pay attention to your pearly whites, as well: Some dentists say the ingredients that make gummy vitamins taste like candy can also contribute to poor mouth health if left unchecked. (But simply brushing can alleviate that.)\n\nAll things considered, Taub-Dix said, gummy vitamins are fine to take. Just be wary of too much added sugar in your diet as a whole \u2014 which includes gummy vitamins if you take them \u2014 and take care of your teeth.\n\nRemember not everyone should be taking vitamins, gummy or not\n\nKathleen Finlay via Getty Images\n\nBoth Li and Taub-Dix said the greatest advantage of gummy vitamins is compliance: People are more inclined to take them because they taste good. But not everyone needs to take vitamins in the first place.\n\n\n\nVitamins are used to treat vitamin deficiencies, which can result from a lack of adequate nutrition, illness, a health condition or pregnancy. It is possible to get the vitamins you need from food, Li noted, and the focus should be on eating a balanced diet. (Li said half of your plate should be filled with vegetables, then a quarter with whole grains and a quarter with protein.)\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the one who only eats hamburgers and fries [and] hates vegetables other than iceberg lettuce, then you may see potential value in adding multivitamins to a diet,\u201d Li said.\n\n\n\nPeople often consume more calories than they need, yet still fall short of the recommended amount of many nutrients. For adults, a low intake of certain nutrients and vitamins \u2014 such as calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and vitamins A, C and E \u2014 can be cause for concern, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. If you\u2019re a parent, you also need to ensure that your children get enough calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium and vitamin E.\n\n\n\nThere are also special groups with more specific vitamin needs, including the elderly, those living with diabetes, those who have alcoholism, patients who have undergone a weight-loss surgery or a resection of the stomach, vegetarians and vegans.\n\n\n\nNot sure if you need vitamins? Consult a doctor or a pediatrician (if the vitamins are for your child), who can help to identify vitamin deficiencies and assess whether a supplement is needed. Keep in mind, Taub-Dix said, that some health care providers may work in partnership with certain supplement brands, so you might find a better price for a comparable product elsewhere.\n\nCheck the label before you purchase\n\nStroll down the vitamin aisle at the store and you\u2019ll notice gummy vitamin labels geared toward specific demographics like women or children. Others appeal to certain health concerns, such as gut health or immune system support. However, products that go by different names can still have overlapping vitamin ingredients, which could potentially be dangerous.\n\nVitamin A, for example, is a fat-soluble vitamin. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed into the body with help from bile acids, which are fluids in the body used to absorb fat. If you consumed a multivitamin, an immune-boosting supplement and food (such as fish oil, milk or eggs, for example) that all have vitamin A in them, Li said, that could be cause for concern, unless you have a vitamin A deficiency. If you take too much vitamin A in total, \u201cit can cause liver failure,\u201d Li added.\n\nComparatively, B vitamins are water-soluble vitamins, which are easily absorbed by your body and aren\u2019t stored in large amounts. \u201cIf you take too much, your kidney just gets rid of it,\u201d Li said.\n\n\n\nConsult a health care provider to avoid exceeding the Recommended Dietary Allowance, based on your individual needs and diet.\n\nKnow that some gummy vitamins aren\u2019t vegetarian- or vegan-friendly\n\nkate_sept2004 via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s also important to check the vitamin label for common allergens, which are called out under the ingredients. Vegan- and vegetarian-friendly options will also typically be called out on the label, but it\u2019s worth double-checking.\n\nGelatin, for example, is used in many gummy vitamin products. It can be produced from animal skin, tendons, ligaments, and/or bones, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. However, there is a product called agar-agar, which is derived from a type of seaweed and may be used as a gelatin substitute for vegans.\n\nKeep in mind the FDA isn\u2019t responsible for checking on the safety of vitamins before they\u2019re sold publicly\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration treats vitamins \u2014 including gummies \u2014 as \u201cdietary supplements.\u201d Therefore, gummy vitamins are subject to the same safety, manufacturing and labeling (and other) requirements as any dietary supplement, FDA press officer Lindsay Haake said in an email.\n\n\n\nHowever, dietary supplements \u2014 including multivitamins \u2014 do not need to be approved by the FDA before they can be sold publicly. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement after it reaches the market. That means it\u2019s up to the companies and individuals who manufacture or market dietary supplements to ensure their products are safe and lawful before selling them.\n\n\u201cFirms can introduce new dietary supplement products to the market without receiving approval from FDA,\u201d Haake said. \u201cIn fact, firms can often lawfully introduce dietary supplements to the market without even notifying FDA.\u201d\n\nThe FDA can inspect dietary supplement facilities to evaluate their compliance with regulations \u2014 and take action where appropriate. That action could include warning letters and recommending judicial action to the Department of Justice, Haake said. If the FDA can prove that a product is unsafe or falsely labeled after it reaches the market, the agency can also have it removed from distribution.\n\nHow can you find a gummy vitamin that is likely to follow safety and quality protocols? Consider buying vitamins from well-known brands, Li said, as they tend to be more consistent in quality and experts know more about them. Consumer Reports has also investigated many major multivitamin brands over the years to ensure their claims are accurate.\n\nBeware of teaching kids that vitamins taste like candy\n\nG&J Fey via Getty Images\n\nThe fact that gummy vitamins often look and taste like candy may increase a child\u2019s willingness to take them. However, that can also lead them to take too many. As most vitamin labels indicate, keep them out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet.\n\n\u201cFor children, because they like the sweet taste, they may take more because they don\u2019t know better,\u201d Li said, adding that parents should supervise their kids while taking gummy vitamins \u2014 and make sure they understand they are not candy.\n\nIf your child exceeds the recommended amount, call the free poison help line at 800-222-1222. Nemours, a nonprofit children\u2019s health organization, also gives this advice: \u201cNever tell a child that medicine tastes like candy.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Kids In This Community Couldn't Get To A Playground.

So they decided to take the parks to the kids.\n\nWith money donated in 2012 by corporate sponsors and a portion of their parish budget, the local parks and recreation agency, known as the Baton Rouge Recreation, or BREC, bought a box delivery truck, painted it with bright colors and filled it with scooters, hula-hoops, balls, slack lines, trampolines, sidewalk chalk and jump ropes.\n\n\u201cThe idea came to us one day while we were watching a bunch of kids turn flips on an old mattress someone had discarded near the office,\u201d said Diane Drake, who directs BREC\u2019s playground on wheels. \u201cWe realized it wouldn\u2019t take much to get kids moving if we put it right in front of them.\u201d\n\nNaming the mobile playground BREC on the Geaux (a Cajun play on words for go), the parks and recreation agency in 2013 started what would become a daily program by holding community events at housing complexes, churches, parks and schools in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nCourtesy of the Recreation and Park Commission for the Parish of East Baton Rouge During a weekslong flood in 2016, the Recreation and Park Commission for the Parish of East Baton Rouge took sports equipment to local shelters to give kids a much-needed play break.\n\nIf peals of laughter and swarms of activity are any indicator, BREC on the Geaux was an immediate success, Drake said. \u201cOnce word spread, children would come running out of their apartments as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. It was all we could do to unload the equipment before they grabbed it and ran off.\u201d\n\nA year after it began, BREC officials drove the mobile playground to Charlotte, North Carolina, to share their story with others at a 2014 meeting of the National Recreation and Park Association.\n\nSince then, BREC has received dozens of emails and phone calls from other cities seeking advice on how to start a similar program, Drake said. Recreation officials in Knoxville, Tennessee, told Stateline in an interview that they plan to start a copy of BREC\u2019s program next year.\n\nOther imitators include Waynesville, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; Mt. Pleasant, Michigan; and Alexandria, Louisiana.\n\nTransporting the joy and the health benefits of play to kids in underserved neighborhoods isn\u2019t a new idea. A concept called \u201cPlay Streets,\u201d in which local volunteers work with police and health officials in urban neighborhoods to temporarily block traffic so kids can play, has been thriving for decades in places like London, Chicago, New York and San Francisco.\n\nBut the idea is only now starting to take root in small and medium-sized cities \u2014 and in a handful of rural towns \u2014 where it turns out that low-income children and adults are even more prone to obesity than in the nation\u2019s urban centers, according to a June report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBaton Rouge was not the first city to launch a mobile playground. \u201cWe stole the truck idea from Rochester, New York,\u201d Drake said, having researched other cities after their initial idea. \u201cBut our concept was different because it was designed to combat obesity.\u201d\n\nRochester\u2019s \u201cRecreation on the Move\u201d program offers homework help, read-aloud programs, art and music, in addition to some sports and group games.\n\nThe oldest known mobile playground started in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, more than 70 years ago, and it\u2019s still operating, Drake said. \u201cThey temporarily repurposed vehicles used to transport seniors one summer and the rest is history.\u201d\n\nIn Winter Park, Florida, a decommissioned fire truck was converted to a playground on wheels in 2012. And in 1997, East Point, Georgia, started using an old police SWAT truck to take play equipment to a basketball park for kids whose parents couldn\u2019t afford to send them to summer camp, Drake said.\n\nBudget-Friendly\n\nBREC started its mobile playground project with $110,000, half from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation and half from the parish budget.\n\nThat paid for the truck, play equipment and staff and sustained the project for two years, with funds left over. In the third year, the agency bought a second truck and hired more staff with new funding from Blue Cross and other donors.\n\nA Play Streets project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported play events in four diverse low-income rural communities last summer \u2014 Warrenton, North Carolina; Talihina, Oklahoma; Oakland, Maryland; and Cameron, Texas \u2014 on a much smaller budget: $6,000 for a handful of community events.\n\nInstead of shutting down a street, the communities held the events in parks, fields and other public spaces.\n\nWorking with a local health department, an agricultural extension service, a church and a tribal health center from the various towns, Robert Wood Johnson researchers found that the Play Streets concept could be cost-effectively adapted for rural communities, said Keshia Pollack Porter, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University who worked on the project.\n\nIn addition to providing needed community interaction as rural residents traveled to town centers for the events, bouncy houses and other inflatable play equipment inspired kids and some adults to get moving. Strapping pedometers on kids who volunteered, researchers showed that physical activity among participating children was higher during the three- to five-hour events than it otherwise would have been.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University\u2019s Pennington Biomedical Research Center found that similar events sponsored by BREC resulted in kids getting about 50 percent more physical activity, as measured in FitBit steps, compared with weekdays and weekends without Play Street events.\n\n\u201cPlay Streets are not a magic bullet,\u201d said Jamie Bussel, a pediatric health expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. But combined with food and nutrition initiatives, and institutionalized by communities, including schools, day care centers and recreation departments, they can go a long way to tamping the nation\u2019s obesity epidemic, she said.\n\nPlay Deserts\n\nJust this week, a report from a Department of Health and Human Services committee published in JAMA noted that 80 percent of U.S. adults and adolescents are not active enough, and recommended that children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 should do an hour or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day.\n\nNationwide, the childhood obesity rate was nearly 16 percent in 2016-2017, CDC data shows. And obese children are more likely to continue to be obese as adults, which puts them at a higher risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and other conditions.\n\nIn addition, children with obesity are at a higher risk of developing chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, sleep apnea, and bone and joint problems. They\u2019re also more likely to be bullied and have depression, low self-esteem or social isolation, CDC data shows.\n\nStates vary widely in the rate of obesity among youths ages 10 to 17, according to the most recent National Survey of Children\u2019s Health. Eight of the 10 states with the highest rates are in the South. Nine of the 10 states with the lowest rates are in the Northeast and West.\n\nMississippi has the highest rate at 26 percent and Utah has the lowest rate at 9 percent. The obesity rate in Louisiana is 19 percent.\n\nOne of the causes attributed to increased obesity in poor urban neighborhoods is a lack of affordable fresh food, sometimes called a \u201cfood desert.\u201d But researchers say that many food deserts are also play deserts, where low-income children lack safe, stimulating outdoor play spaces.\n\nIn many low-income neighborhoods, parks are plentiful but tend to be poorly maintained and lack amenities such as up-to-date play equipment. They also might be in areas that are unsafe for children to walk to on their own, said Johns Hopkins\u2019 Porter.\n\nThe Elm Grove community in Baton Rouge is one of them, Drake said. That\u2019s why BREC on the Geaux parks there once a week to set up shop. \u201cYou can see the kids peeking out of their windows and doors as we pull up,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they see our truck, they start running.\u201d\n\nDee Taylor calls herself the grandmother and great-grandmother of Elm Grove, a subsidized apartment complex in Baton Rouge. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much of anything for the kids on the grounds.\n\n\u201cThey stayed in their apartments and watched too much TV or played video games all day in the summer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the only thing they knew to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when I heard about BREC on the Geaux, I made a call and they came.\u201d Taylor put up a notice about the mobile playground\u2019s schedule in the window of her apartment and another one on the door of the building\u2019s management office. She told everyone she knew.\n\n\u201cA child needs that kind of physical activity to grow up in a wholesome way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we can give them, the better their lives will be.\u201d\n\nBREC\u2019s two play trucks visit dozens of housing complexes, elementary schools and parks in Baton Rouge every week. They show up at community gatherings on the weekend. During the Louisiana floods of 2016, BREC\u2019s trucks made the rounds at local shelters, giving children a much-needed daily play break.\n\nBREC on the Geaux had more than 100,000 participants in 2016, adults and children. \u201cWe may have been the hardest-working mobile play unit in the business,\u201d Drake said. But since then, BREC was short on funds and had to curtail its schedule slightly. Based on demand, the program should be expanding, Drake said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "IVFML Season 2, Episode 5: When Secondary Infertility Strikes, There's Not Much Sympathy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivfml-season-2-episode-5-secondary-infertility_us_5beb06b5e4b0783e0a1ce980", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:02:00", "body_paragraphs": "About 3 million women in the U.S. have one biological child but struggle to conceive or carry to term another pregnancy \u2015 a condition known as secondary infertility.\n\nFor some, infertility is a consequence of age, declining egg or sperm quality or medical conditions that may have set in after the birth of a child.\n\nBut others may have started off infertile and needed infertility treatments to conceive the child they already have.\n\nListen to Episode 5 of IVFML Becoming Family below.\n\nFor this segment of the secondary infertility population, the notion that a successful pregnancy and birth can \u201cfix\u201d primary infertility has a lot of cultural currency. Like many deeply rooted cultural myths, the idea has a kernel of truth in it.\n\nIn this episode of IVFML, we go back to our guests from Season One to ask what life is like now that they had children thanks to infertility treatments and whether they are trying to add to their family.\n\nInfertility is a diverse diagnosis, experts say, and whether couples will be able to conceive spontaneously depends on why they were deemed infertile in the first place.\n\nSome people, like Season One guest John Murray, were able to spontaneously conceive a child after infertility treatments. Other guests, like Silvija Ozols or Nam and Aubrey Tran, may hope for a similar outcome but may be more resigned to plunging back into infertility treatments when it comes time to bring more children into the family. Our final guest for the episode, Candace Wohl, knew from the beginning that she would never conceive that \u201csurprise\u201d baby. Wohl had her uterus removed as part of cancer treatment, and thus cannot carry a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cFor many couples, the diagnosis of infertility is more gray,\u201d said Dr. Beth W. Rackow, a fertility specialist at Columbia University Fertility Center.\n\n\u201cSome of these couples may be subfertile and can still conceive on her own,\u201d she explained. \u201cHowever, pursuing infertility treatment can speed up the time until pregnancy.\u201d\n\nAnd while a minority of patients will conceive spontaneously on their own, the odds are that if you needed help to have your first child, you\u2019re going to need help with your second child, said Dr. Ilana Ressler, a reproductive endocrinologist with Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut.\n\nThat struggle may be different the second time around, Ressler said.\n\n\u201cIt can be isolating, with less social support, as the couple already has a child,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may feel reluctant or guilty reaching out to others for fear of not \u2018being grateful\u2019 for the child they already have.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, said Rackow, couples may feel a new ease or lightness when it comes to infertility treatments to add more children to the family.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is the distraction of a child, or a different sense of possibility since they have conceived before,\u201d she guessed."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Announces New Headquarters In Virginia, New York City", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-hq2-new-york-virginia-queens_us_5beae68fe4b0783e0a1c8db0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:02:01", "body_paragraphs": "SEATTLE \u2015 Amazon today announced that it has selected New York City and Arlington, Virginia, as the locations for the company\u2019s new headquarters.\n\nAmazon will invest $5 billion and create more than 50,000 jobs across the two new headquarters locations, with more than 25,000 employees each in New York City and Arlington.\n\nThe new locations will join Seattle as the company\u2019s three headquarters in North America.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful.

(Rubin disputes the claim.)\n\nGetty Editorial Google employees at its European headquarters in Dublin join others around the world in walking out of their offices on Nov. 1 in protest over claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism at the tech giant.\n\nThe company gave three executives similarly cushy treatment, even though it did not have any legal obligation to do so, the Times found.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we have terminated 48 people, including 13 senior managers and above for sexual harassment,\u201d Pichai noted in his email. \u201cNone of these people received an exit package. And to clarify: in that time, we have also not provided any exit packages to executives who departed voluntarily in the course of a sexual harassment investigation.\u201d\n\nEvent organizers published a list of five demands for protesters to coalesce around, including pay equity, greater transparency at several levels in Google and an end to forced arbitration agreements.\n\nWe, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nProtesters at the walkout in New York City hoisted signs calling out sexual misconduct and gender inequity in tech, with at least a couple of pointed references to Rubin\u2019s payout.\n\n\u201cHappy to quit for $90 million,\u201d read one woman\u2019s sign. \u201cNo sexual harassment required!\u201d\n\nThe first of many coordinated #GoogleWalkout protests has begun - this is at the firm\u2019s office in Singapore.

He was a surfer and skateboarder as a young man. He grew up in San Francisco and worked at a store in the hippie heyday of Haight-Ashbury, selling candles and crystals, a job that allowed him to pursue his passion of music. And then tech money flooded the city, his neighborhood was gentrified, and like so many others he was priced out.\n\nHe left San Francisco a decade ago and settled down in Paradise, Calif., near the woods. By then, he was sick and bedridden and often in pain, but he never stopped thinking of San Francisco. A few months ago he sent his daughter, Angela Loo, on a mission: to go back to the city and take videos of his favorite places, so he could see how they had changed.\n\n\u201cHis San Francisco roots were very important to him,\u201d Ms. Loo said. \u201cIt\u2019s where he got into music. And did his thing and where he raised his kids. It\u2019s his hometown and he loved it very much and he missed it all the time.\u201d\n\nThose videos were some of the last glimpses of the city for Mr. Foss, who died at 63 a few days ago in the wildfire that reduced Paradise to ash. His body was found outside his home, near his minivan, in what Ms. Loo believes was a desperate attempt to escape with his stepson Andrew Burt, his caretaker, as the flames engulfed the street. Mr. Foss\u2019s dog, Bernice, a little brown mutt he had rescued from a shelter, died there too.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which tore through Paradise and its surroundings last week, has become the deadliest wildfire in modern California history, with at least 56 people confirmed dead so far. Another three people were killed in the Woolsey Fire, which raced through the mountains of Southern California near Malibu.\n\nWith so many still unaccounted for and investigators scouring the ruins of Paradise and collecting DNA samples from relatives of the missing, the identities of many more victims are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. On Tuesday night, the Butte County sheriff, Kory Honea, said the number of missing was in the hundreds. The department has released a list with 103 names on it, which \u201cin no way is a list of everybody,\u201d said a spokesman for the department, Megan McCann.\n\nAmong those unaccounted for, although not on the list, is Mr. Burt, Ms. Loo\u2019s stepbrother.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have confirmation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I do have confirmation of is that he was last seen trying to help, or get help, for my dad to get him into their van, and failing at it. They just didn\u2019t make it. I can\u2019t imagine that he is alive, but we have not stopped looking. We are still calling the shelters every day. We are calling the hospitals every day.\u201d\n\nImage Ernie Foss\n\nMr. Foss is among a handful of the victims whose names have been released, as authorities slowly add to the roster of the dead. Jesus Fernandez, 48, died of smoke inhalation, probably trying to rescue his dog, King. Mr. Fernandez, nicknamed Zeus, had a son who lives in Las Vegas, and was described by a friend as someone \u201cwho people counted on in rough times.\u201d\n\nAlso killed in the fire was Bill Godbout, 79, an influential figure in the early days of Silicon Valley who ran a popular electronics store. He was well-known in the hacker community, and remembered for his quirks, like his license to fly blimps. Robert Tuck, Mr. Godbout\u2019s grandson, said that Mr. Godbout had stayed behind as his wife and relatives fled, probably to save his three cats.\n\nAs his family drove away, they looked back and \u201ccould see the fire coming down on the house,\u201d Mr. Tuck said through tears. \u201cHe was listening to the radio report and thought he had a little more time.\u201d\n\nAnd while the family of 58-year-old Lolene Rios has kept her listed as missing, her stepdaughter told a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle that they believed she had died trapped inside her home.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just a recovery effort,\u201d said Maria Rios, whose father Rick Rios escaped and is now recovering from severe burns on his hands and face. \u201cMy dad is in a lot of pain \u2014 he keeps saying, \u2018I have no skin, no skin.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Loo spoke expansively about her father \u2014 his days as a musician in San Francisco, when he was in so many blues and rock bands that she couldn\u2019t remember any of their names but one, Raine Daze. She recalled how their living room in their cottage in the Fillmore District was turned into a music studio, for recording and teaching lessons to students; how all of his recordings had been lost in the fire; and his last painful years in Paradise with lymphedema, a condition that swells the arms and legs.\n\n\u201cYou know, whenever something like this happens we tend to focus on all the positive attributes of a person,\u201d she said. \u201cGraciously ignoring all of their faults. My dad was not a perfect person. He struggled in life and was perfectly imperfect.\u201d\n\nMuch of Mr. Foss\u2019s music is lost, and so are many old photos, but there is one memento she does have: the scarf her father wore when he played music. A few years ago he said to her, \u201cI want you to take your daddy\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll scarf.\u201d She described it as \u201clike Mick Jagger\u2019s scarf.\u201d\n\nImage Jesus Fernandez\n\nEvery few months, Ms. Loo, 43, who lives in Oregon, would travel to Paradise to clean her father\u2019s house, stock up at Costco, and fill the freezer with home-cooked meals. \u201cThey lived like men, you know, my dad and my stepbrother,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Paradise, friends dropped by when they were able, and social workers and volunteers came over to keep him company, sometimes to watch his beloved 49ers or Giants with him. But over all, it was a lonely time for Mr. Foss.\n\n\u201cHe was isolated,\u201d said Ms. Loo. \u201cHe was an extrovert. He was a people person. He has been a teacher and a mentor and a friend his whole life.\u201d\n\nHe was also constantly in physical pain, something Mr. Foss wrote about in his last Facebook post, three days before he died, in which he talked about his health, and losing a wife and son in recent years.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a challenge to me physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI lost my wife six years ago and my firstborn son a little more than three years ago. I am asking for prayers and positive energy.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the lasting memories Ms. Loo has of her father, one that brought her to tears as she recounted it.\n\nMr. Foss also had melanoma, and the few times he got out of the house and out of Paradise were when he would get his cancer treatments.\n\nA few years ago, after being brought home in an ambulance, a light rain \u2014 just a mist \u2014 began falling, and he asked to be left outside, on his gurney, so he could feel the rain and look at the trees. The mist, she said, reminded him of San Francisco."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Trump Embraces a Path to Ease U.S. Sentencing", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/prison-sentencing-trump.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:02:06", "body_paragraphs": "The other half of the proposed bill creates a package of incentives and new programs aimed at improving prison conditions and preparing prisoners for re-entry into their communities.

It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: \u201cYou need to limit fats to avoid extra calories,\u201d it states.\n\nBut experts like Dr. Ludwig argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.\n\nDr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example.

The company\u2019s sleek device (nicknamed the iPhone of e-cigarettes) resembles a flash drive and comes with flavor pods like cr\u00e8me and mango, leading public health officials to criticize the company and others for appearing to market directly to teenagers, who are especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction.\n\nE-cigarettes were originally developed to help smokers quit by giving them a way to satisfy their nicotine cravings without the tar and deadly carcinogens that come with burning tobacco.\n\n\u201cOur intent was never to have youth use Juul,\u201d said Kevin Burns, chief executive of Juul Labs in a statement emailed to reporters. \u201cBut intent is not enough. The numbers are what matter and the numbers tell us underage use of e-cigarettes is a problem.\u201d\n\nBut critics and public health advocates said the company had no choice, especially after the F.D.A. seized documents related to marketing strategies from the company\u2019s headquarters last month, and while some states were investigating whether its tactics were directly aimed at minors.\n\nCaroline Renzulli, a spokeswoman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called Juul\u2019s announcement too little too late. \u201cJuul\u2019s social media marketing fueled its popularity with kids,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that it has captured 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, Juul no longer needs to do social media marketing because its young customers are doing it for them.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Vitamin D and Fish Oils Are Ineffective for Preventing Cancer and Heart Disease", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/well/live/vitamin-d-and-fish-oils-are-ineffective-for-preventing-cancer-and-heart-disease.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-15 09:02:08", "body_paragraphs": "In recent years, many Americans have embraced vitamin D and fish oil pills, their enthusiasm fueled by a steady trickle of suggestive research studies linking higher levels of vitamin D with lower rates of cancer and other ills, and fish consumption with reduced heart disease.\n\nNow a large and rigorous government-funded random ized trial \u2014 the only such study of omega-3 fish oils ever carried out in healthy adults, and the largest trial ever done of high-dose vitamin D \u2014 has found the supplements do not lower cancer rates in healthy adults. Nor do they reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events, a composite of heart attacks, strokes and deaths from cardiovascular disease. The trial is of the kind considered the gold standard in medicine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but there have always been such high expectations that vitamin D can do all these different things,\u201d said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen of the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough, who was a co-author of an editorial on the studies in The New England Journal of Medicine.

I don\u2019t think there is anything there,\u201d Dr. Rosen said.
