Accused of espionage, the 31-year-old was held in solitary confinement for almost six months. But he was released on bail last month.\n\nA family spokeswoman said Hedges was forced to sign a confession in Arabic, a language Hedges does not read or speak.\n\nBritain has warned of \"serious diplomatic consequences\" for the UAE's imprisonment of Hedges and could threaten to derail relations between the two countries.\n\nBen Bradshaw, the member of Parliament who represents Hedges' constituency, told CNN he was \"completely horrified\" by the decision. Bradshaw said the British government and Durham University have assured UAE authorities that Hedges is not a spy.\n\n\"This is totally unacceptable for a friendly government like the UAE to treat a British citizen in this way,\" Bradshaw said.\n\n\"The British government needs to make quite clear to the Emiratis that should any harm come to Matthew for any reason, that they will bear full responsibility for that.\"\n\nHedges' sentence on Wednesday appeared to come as a surprise to British authorities. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the verdict was not what the UK \"expected from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom\" and that it was \"contrary to earlier assurances.\"\n\nHedges' wife, Daniela Tejada, said that the past six months have been the \"worst\" of her life.\n\nHunt said in a statement he was \"deeply shocked and disappointed\" by the verdict. \"I have repeatedly made clear that the handling of this case by the UAE authorities will have repercussions for the relationship between our two countries, which has to be built on trust,\" he said.\n\n\"I regret the fact that we have reached this position and I urge the UAE to reconsider.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May told the UK Parliament she was \"deeply disappointed and concerned\" at the verdict.\n\n\"We are raising it with the Emirati authorities at the highest level,\" she added.\n\nWife distraught\n\nHedges' wife, Daniela Tejada -- who was present at the hearing -- said she was in \"complete shock\" and that her husband was \"shaking when he heard the verdict.\"\n\nShe was deeply critical of the British handling of the case, insisting that Hedges is innocent.\n\n\"The Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them,\" Tejada said. \"This whole case has been handled appallingly from the very beginning with no one taking Matthew's case seriously.\"\n\n\"The British government must take a stand now for Matthew, one of their citizens. They say that the UAE is an ally, but the overwhelmingly arbitrary handling of Matt's case indicates a scarily different reality, for which Matt and I are being made to pay a devastatingly high price.\"\n\nTejada added that this has been \"the worst six months\" of her life. \"The UAE authorities should feel ashamed for such an obvious injustice. I am very scared for Matt. I don't know where they are taking him or what will happen now. Our nightmare has gotten even worse,\" Tejada said.\n\nThe UAE government has not responded to a CNN request for comment.\n\nSpying charges\n\nThe UAE attorney general, Hamad Al Shamsi, announced on October 15 that Hedges had been charged with \"spying for and on behalf of a foreign state, jeopardizing the military, economy and political security of the UAE.\" Shamsi said Hedges had entered the UAE \"under the 'cover' of academic research.\"\n\nHedges was in the UAE conducting interviews for his PhD thesis, his wife says.\n\nAccording to a letter posted on Tejada's Twitter account in October, the 31-year-old had been in the UAE to conduct interviews for his Ph.D. thesis examining civil-military relations in the wake of the Arab Spring.\n\nIt is not clear whether there is a wider diplomatic context to the Hedges case, but ties between the UK and the UAE have become strained recently. The UAE and its bigger regional ally, Saudi Arabia, have led efforts to contain the spread of Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East. To the private irritation of the UAE, London does not classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, and its members are eligible for asylum in the UK if they can demonstrate evidence of persecution.\n\nThe UAE is part of the Saudi-led coalition that is fighting the Iran-backed Islamist rebels in Yemen. This week, the UK circulated a draft resolution that would call a ceasefire in the besieged port city of Hodeida.\n\nRadha Stirling, chief executive of UK-based legal advice group Detained in Dubai, said she has seen a \"growing concern\" in the US and Australia \"as to whether the Gulf nation is truly an ally or actually a threat to national interests.\"\n\n\"For the moment, the UAE consistently displays that reality is a complete contradiction to the modern image its PR companies try to push to Western tourists and investors.\"\n\nStirling said while she expects that Hedges will launch an appeal, \"we must remember that he will be facing a judicial system that is known for corruption, unfair trials, forced confessions and discrimination.\"\n\nShe added: \"The UK courts have repeatedly denied all extradition requests to the country on this basis and, in Matthew's case, the ultimate determination of his matter will come down to the ruling party, not to the legal system.\"\n\n'A cocktail of medication'\n\nThe Hedges' family spokeswoman said that during his first six weeks of detention, Hedges was \"interrogated without a lawyer, or consular access, and held in solitary confinement.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman said Hedges' health grew worse in the subsequent months. \"His mental and physical health seriously deteriorated. Matt was fed a cocktail of medication by the prison guards including Xanax, Valium and Ritalin,\" she said. \"After four months of solitary confinement he began vomiting on a daily basis.\"\n\nTomorrow, Nov 21, Matt will be appearing in court in Abu Dhabi.

Pyne is a professor in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University and the author of \"Between Two Fires: A Fire History of Contemporary America\" and \"To the Last Smoke,\" a series of regional fire surveys. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) In October 1918, a swarm of smoldering fires flared and rode rising winds through 1,500 square miles outside Duluth, Minnesota. The flames incinerated cities, killed at least 450 people, and overtook evacuees as they fled in cars. It wasn't the last fire of a cycle that began in 1825 in Maine and migrated through the Lake States before moving on, but it was the last in which the fallen numbered in the hundreds.\n\nThen, over several decades, the scene calmed.\n\nThat former era of firestorms was sparked along the frontier. Settlers and logging companies felled the forests and left lands lathered in slash. They used fires widely to work the land into agriculture. They built houses and towns out of wood, and they lacked much incentive to prevent burning, or the capacity to fight the fires that blew up. Railroads cast sparks with abandon.\n\nYear after year, decade after decade, the sorrowful scenario repeated. But after the 1918 eruption, the rising tide ebbed.\n\nThis did not occur spontaneously. Cities gradually adopted fire and building codes and enforced them. They zoned in ways to halt fire spread and ensure egress. They installed a fire protection infrastructure.\n\nIndividual buildings and a town block burned here and there, but fires in cities no longer spread like fires in forests. The countryside also changed. Settlement ceased, and logging and its slash heaps were more or less domesticated. The wild and the settled were untangled into separate realms, routine burning on the landscape yielded to internal combustion, and firefighting agencies matured.\n\nBy the mid-20th century the horrific fires had faded, replaced with occasional outbreaks more akin to seasonal flu than an epidemic on the order of the Spanish flu (which, incidentally, had begun earlier in 1918).\n\nNow the flames are back. Why? Because the conditions that spawned the era of frontier fires have found modern surrogates. A new wave of settlement is recolonizing our formerly rural lands, this time converting to towns or exurbs, often out of materials similar to that of their surroundings. Building codes and zoning are often feeble, or have come decades after indifferent attention. Fire protection has strengthened, but it also eliminated, as a consequence, the \"good,\" smaller blazes that had formerly pruned back fuels that might otherwise feed a conflagration.\n\nThe countryside matured, sometimes in unhelpful ways because of the success of fire exclusion campaigns. Geographies that had been painfully segregated remixed as suburbs and pushed against wildlands, while urban enclaves and exurbs found themselves amid revanchist woods. Climate change lengthened fire seasons and worsened some of the conditions that allowed vegetation to convert into fuel. It assumed the role of performance enhancer that slash had earlier previously served. The fires mutated from occasional nuisances into menaces.\n\nThe problem manifested itself most dramatically in postwar California and was dismissed as a California quirk. Then it infected much of the American West with flames rushing around Spokane, Reno, the Wasatch Front, and -- with particular venom -- Colorado's Front Range. Then they moved into the Great Plains, then outside Austin, Texas, the coastal plains, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\nAt first, the prevailing narrative was one of dumb Californians (or westerners) putting houses where there were bound to be fires. Increasingly, thanks to climate change and land use, the narrative is becoming one of fires going to where the houses are.\n\nWhat can we do to turn the tide again? We can relearn the lessons of that last-century plague.\n\nMost basically, we need to define the problem correctly.\n\nThe \"wildland-urban interface\" is a dumb, geeky name coined in California in the early 1970s. It viewed the problem of wildfires from the perspective of wildlands. By then the wildland fire community -- that is, the federal agencies (such as the National Park Service and Forest Service) and some state and private institutions that were concerned with fire on landscapes -- had admitted the self-destructive folly of trying to exclude all fire from all lands and had committed to restoring \"good\" fire.\n\nIt defined the problem as one of encroaching houses and the loss of a rural buffer zone. It knew it could not eliminate all fires, and couldn't afford to, since in most landscapes fire was both inevitable and necessary. But it saw those fires getting more savage and knew that new houses compromised attempts to contain fires as a wildland issue.\n\nBut we might equally view the problem from the other side of the interface, that is, from cities and sprawling towns. Suburbs and exurbs are fringes and fragments of cities with peculiar landscaping. They are amenable to the methods that tamed America's urban blazes in that earlier era: fire codes, life safety codes, building codes, zoning, an infrastructure for urban fire protection.\n\nSuch a redefinition makes sense because plenty of research, not only in the US but in Australia and elsewhere, points to ember swarms as the primary ignition source in threatened communities. Blizzards of sparks from an advancing fire act on the structure itself and on the flammable material -- shrubs, mulch and pine needles --immediately around it. This \"home ignition zone,\"as it's called, holds the critical points of vulnerability. It's where fire enters the built environment.\n\nJUST WATCHED California Camp Fire sets grim new records Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California Camp Fire sets grim new records 01:20\n\nSimilarly, we know that fires occur in patterns -- as do winds, such as those blasting California -- and like flood plains, they map zones of high risk. They help identify what communities need the most urgent attention. (Malibu has burned so often, for example, it might make sense to highlight decades without a \"disaster\" fire.)\n\nYes, the countryside needs treatment as well. We can dampen the ferocity of the flames -- the size of fires will depend mostly on the winds, but their intensity will depend on the fuel characteristics of the landscape. The home ignition zone has a counterpart around whole communities -- a \"community ignition zone.\" There are lots of techniques for treating such areas, for fashioning the fire equivalent of greenbelts around communities and municipal watersheds.\n\nWe can also begin to substitute prescribed, semi-tame flames for the feral fires that now result from accidents, lightning, and power lines, which function today as railroads did a century ago.\n\nBut we need to choose solutions that make sense in terms of how fire behaves and kindles structures. Felling the woods will worsen the scene, unless you clean up afterwards. This can be expensive and brings its own hazards from burning the slash, which can lead to other fires and noxious smoke.\n\nWe can't stop winds and abolish vegetation and eliminate fires. We can make communities sufficiently resilient to accept those outbursts without burning to stone and killing residents.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe can go beyond thoughts and prayers, and the misbegotten sense that mass burnings must echo mass shootings in their random destruction and our helplessness to stop them.\n\nA century ago the horror of the 1918 outbreak marked a tipping point.

The US Judiciary has strived to be above the political fray that has only been exacerbated by Trump.\n\nRoberts' response stems specifically from Trump's comments on Tuesday on District Court Judge Jon Tigar's Monday night decision to temporarily block an executive order that would have scaled back US asylum policy. Trump criticized the San Francisco-based Tigar, nominated in 2012, as an \"Obama judge.\" Of the regional US circuit court that would oversee any appeal of the case, Trump declared, \"an automatic loss\" for the administration and \"the 9th Circuit is very unfair.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, made public because of a query from The Associated Press, Roberts said, \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Roberts had been asked to comment, but it was the first time he decided to go public. A 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, Roberts did not explain his timing.\n\nBut it may arise from the combination of Trump's specific insult -- portraying Tigar in a political realm based on the president who appointed him -- as well as the recent confirmation turmoil over new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nRoberts' public concern for the reputation of the federal judiciary comes as the Supreme Court is riven 5-4 along ideological and political lines. The recent retirement of swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy has deepened the split, and Roberts has already signaled an effort to try to lessen the divisions among the nine.\n\nThe chief justice spoke out broadly about judicial independence in October after the tumultuous Kavanaugh hearings. Addressing a University of Minnesota audience, Roberts referred to \"the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\" and then asserted the high court's independence from the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\"I will not criticize the political branches,\" he said. \"We do that often enough in our opinions. But what I would like to do, briefly, is emphasize how the judicial branch is -- how it must be -- very different.\"\n\nRoberts' statement on Wednesday was of a different magnitude, stronger and deliberately echoing back the President's own remark about an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nThe chief justice has often expressed dismay when judges are referred to by political affiliation. He has also observed since 2010, with the retirement of liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, an appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford, that it may be more difficult to convince the public of justices' impartiality from politics.\n\nSince Stevens was succeeded by Obama-appointee Elena Kagan, and continuing with Trump's choice of Kavanaugh, the court's five conservative justices were named by Republican presidents and the four liberals -- often relegated to the dissent -- were named by Democratic presidents.\n\nWith Kennedy's retirement, Roberts is now ideologically at the middle of the court, and he may be inclined to hedge his own conservative instincts to steady the bench and avoid more polarization.\n\nAs he considered whether to answer Trump's latest affront to the judiciary on Tuesday, Roberts no doubt weighed how much he might provoke Trump. Roberts plainly concluded it was time to defend judiciary's special role in America's democracy.\n\nThe 63-year-old chief was likely not surprised that within three hours, Trump fired back in two consecutive tweets: \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' but if it is ... are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nRoberts offered no new retort. And given the chief justice's aversion to the appearance of politics, he is unlikely to offer any response any time soon."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The President's company braces for Democratic investigations", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/-LGWRP02dyY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In the days after the midterm elections, executives at President Donald Trump's family business, the Trump Organization, huddled on calls to discuss the possible implications of Democrats winning back the House of Representatives and the potential risk that poses to the company.\n\nWhile the Trump Organization has a long history of lawsuits, and currently faces multiple investigations from state and federal authorities, the prospect of a Democratic-controlled House, armed with subpoena power and bent on investigating every aspect of the President's life, presents a different threat altogether, according to interviews with multiple people familiar with the company's internal discussions or close to the President's legal team.\n\nIn September, one person familiar with the company told CNN that \"the worst thing for the business would be a change of control in Congress.\"\n\nRepublicans still hold the Senate, but there are a lot of ways a Democratic majority in the House can make life difficult for the Trump Organization. Committee chairs can drag executives in front of public hearings and compel testimony about all manner of the private company's dealings. They can also inundate it with document requests.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, executives reminded staff to preserve records, according to a person familiar with the conversations. They also discussed bringing on additional outside counsel, that person said, particularly a firm with expertise in government investigations. Though it's unclear how serious they are about that option\u2014 two other people familiar with Trump's legal team say they are not aware of an effort to hire more lawyers\u2014 doing so would be a big shift for the president's family-owned business, which tends to rely on a tight group of longtime loyal executives and attorneys.\n\nTwo of the company's lawyers tell CNN they're comfortable with their current team, which they say is well-prepared and battle-tested given the number of lawsuits the company has faced over the years. There is also a sense, wishful thinking perhaps, that Democratic investigations may not be as politically damaging as some close to the president fear.\n\nLawyers close to the President and his company suggest Democrats may temper their inquiries once they formally take over next year amid pressure to balance the potential political fallout of looking like they're out to get the Trump Organization against other investigative priorities, such as government spending by cabinet members. Some of those same lawyers say they anticipate Congress will strike a softer tone in order to advance other Democratic priorities such as protecting healthcare and passing an infrastructure package.\n\nOpen investigations\n\nWhatever happens, the Democratic takeover of the House is still more than a month away. Until then, the Trump Organization will continue to deal with two open investigations and the threat of a third. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is investigating allegations of tax fraud, CNN has reported , while the Manhattan US attorney's office is examining whether executives violated campaign-finance laws in their effort to help facilitate hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump. That probe is the subject of an \"ongoing\" grand jury investigation , according to court filings and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office is currently pursuing a civil law suit against the President's charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, as well as against the President himself and his adult children. The office is also weighing whether it could pursue a criminal probe of the charity, an effort that could touch on the Trump Organization, given how closely the nonprofit and company are intertwined. Tish James, the state's newly-elected attorney general, ran for the seat by promising voters an aggressive pursuit of the President.\n\nThe Trump Organization also has the problem of Michael Cohen, the company's former vice president and Trump's longtime lawyer, who pleaded guilty in August to eight counts brought by the Manhattan US Attorney's office. Cohen has been speaking with federal investigators and is set to be sentenced on December 12. Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, received limited immunity for his cooperation in prosecutors' investigation of Cohen. Weisselberg's cooperation is limited to the Cohen investigation.\n\nWeisselberg, along with the company's longtime general counsel, Alan Garten, are among 30 people connected to the President and his business dealings that California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff would like to interview. Schiff, the likely incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has indicated that he will make investigating possible Russian money laundering a top priority. That includes potential money laundering through the Trump Organization, as well as foreign payments made to former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both of whom pleaded guilty to financial crimes in the special counsel's investigation.\n\nIf and when Democrats do launch new probes into the President's business, the Trump Organization plans to highlight previous cooperation with congressional committees as evidence of the good faith efforts it has made in the past, said the person familiar with its plans. The firm has turned over documents to various congressional committees for the last two years, providing documents to lawmakers probing Russian election meddling and answering requests for information about possible violations of the anti-corruption clauses in the constitution, known as emoluments clauses.\n\nExisting subpoenas\n\nWhen it comes to questions about ethics matters, including emoluments, the Trump Organization has responded to about 85 percent of the requests, the person said. Democratic staffers disagree with the characterization, pointing out that many of the responses didn't actually provide enough or even any information.\n\nIn a 2017 response to Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings' request for information on how the firm tracks foreign government payments, the company provided an outline of a system it had designed to monitor foreign government revenue and how to calculate profits from it. The lawmaker belittled the Trump Organization's plan, calling it a \"pamphlet\" that \"raised grave concerns.\"\n\nDemocrats have said that the hundreds of letters they've sent over the past two years \u2014 requesting documents themselves or pleading with Republicans to investigate various issues \u2014 provide an investigative roadmap for when they take the majority, and the Trump Organization has been a frequent target across multiple committees.\n\nDemocrats are still deciding which of those investigations they want to prioritize. Democratic aides say there's no master list yet of how investigations will be launched in the new Congress, but the sheer number of committees that want to probe the Trump Organization \u2014 there are at least five\u2014 signals that the company will be a top priority, particularly when it comes to issues such as foreign payments made to Trump, allegations of Russian money laundering, and gaining access to Trump's personal tax returns.\n\n\"I've always believed that the key here is follow the money,\" said Rep. Denny Heck of Washington, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"That would be my strongest desire: that we do something to get at some of the questions that were raised about whether or not the Russians had undue influence over President Trump because of some preexisting financial entanglements.\"\n\nTrump's relationship with Deutsche Bank, which was fined in a Russian money laundering scheme, is one topic multiple committees have said they want to examine, given the bank's history of lending to Trump-related businesses and projects. California Rep. Maxine Waters, who is expected to chair the House Financial Services Committee, has pressed for an investigation into Deutsche Bank, and sent letters requesting information about its Russian operations and whether accounts Trump and his family members held had any ties to Russia.\n\nA spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the change in leadership and referred CNN to a previous statement, which said, \"Deutsche Bank takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.\"\n\nLooking for lawyers\n\nThe President's company is facing a situation not all that dissimilar from the President himself. With special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian election interference entering its final phase, and House Democrats preparing to unleash a barrage of investigations, the White House is seeking to hire as many as two dozen attorneys to fill out its counsel's office, whose ranks have been depleted in past months as staff attorneys have left.\n\nBut there's a difference between hiring lawyers for the White House and for the President's company. Taxpayers foot the bill for those White House attorneys, while the money to defend his company comes from the Trump family. Over the years, the company has been loath to spend big money on lots of expensive attorneys, deciding instead to rely on a small group of loyal people to handle the its legal issues.\n\nThe company's primary outside lawyer is Alan Futerfas, a New York-based criminal defense lawyer who represents not only the Trump Organization, but also the President's eldest sons, Donald Jr and Eric, who now head the company. Futerfas' firm of only three principal attorneys has been the front-line response team to multiple investigations by Mueller's office, Manhattan federal prosecutors and several congressional committees.\n\nFuterfas works closely with Garten, the company's general counsel. While Futerfas has handled the bulk of the inquiries for both the company and the sons, at some point the interests of those clients could diverge, opening up the need for another set of lawyers to represent just the company. Futerfas and Garten did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did The Trump Organization.\n\nThe lines separating the interests of Trump and those of his company were indistinguishable prior to his arrival at the White House. When he took office in January 2017, he put his assets in a trust and handed over day-to-day management of his business to Donald Jr and Eric. Over the years Trump has turned to a reliable set of outside law firms to represent both him and his company. That includes the firm Morgan Lewis, which has advised Trump on tax issues, as well as two lawyers in particular, Marc Kasowitz and Larry Rosen.\n\nKasowitz, a longtime attorney for Trump, continues to be involved in a variety of matters for the President, most notably defending him in the ongoing defamation lawsuit brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on \"The Apprentice.\" Kasowitz was an early member of the President's legal team handling matters arising from the Mueller investigation but in July 2017 he stepped aside and made way for John Dowd, who left in May 2018.\n\nRosen has represented Trump since the early 1990s, most recently handling campaign-related matters and a defamation lawsuit filed against the President by GOP strategist Cheryl Jacobus. He also represented Cohen in an arbitration dispute concerning payments made to Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump. The White House has denied her allegations.\n\nEarlier this year, following a shakeup of the President's private defense team, a few large law firms passed on the opportunity to defend him in the Mueller investigation. If the Trump Organization does decide it needs to hire more lawyers, it may face similar issues given the impression among some lawyers that the President and his company don't pay their legal fees. At least three defense attorneys based in New York and D.C. raised that as a concern to CNN-- though none had been approached by the company about representing it. One lawyer said his firm has a policy of not working with the company. Firms have also turned it down because their other clients have balked at the notion of being associated with the President, his family or his company.\n\nUltimately, the extent of the scrutiny that is brought on the company will become clear as Democrats take control of the House in January."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Top Trump officials saved the President from himself", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/pyVrfCWQQck/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Had President Donald Trump been successful in launching prosecutions against Hillary Clinton and James Comey, it could have spelled the end of his presidency, as a clear-cut abuse of power.\n\nIt never happened, apparently thwarted by then-White House Counsel Don McGahn and other senior officials. But that does not mean this is a crisis dodged for Trump and he is now free from fresh legal and political jeopardy. Quite the reverse.\n\nAt the very least, the latest developments underline how Trump's senior subordinates may have shielded a President unschooled in constitutional norms from disastrous steps that could have put his presidency in peril.\n\nAnd it leaves anyone on the outside wondering what other potential disasters top officials like McGahn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein might have prevented.\n\nThey also raise questions about the capacity of a now-understaffed White House and legal counsel's operation to protect the President from current or future transgressions.\n\nIt will be impossible to confirm, given the habitual silence from the special counsel's office, but the revelations hint at the possibility that Robert Mueller knows much more about what went on in the corridors of the West Wing than has been publicly revealed.\n\nThat will play into rising tensions in Washington amid expectations that the endgame of Mueller's probe is in sight and speculation about possible indictments targeting Trump world and the content of his final report.\n\nBombshell reports by CNN and The New York Times about the President's intentions emerged on another surreal day in Washington that saw shocking disclosures about Ivanka Trump's emails and a huge foreign policy pivot over Saudi Arabia\n\nThey will bolster perceptions that Trump views the Justice Department as an instrument of his personal power rather than an insulated government department responsible for the neutral administration of justice.\n\nTrump had forecast his intentions\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that the President, on multiple occasions, asked Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then chief of staff to the attorney general, how they were doing in investigating Clinton.\n\nEarlier, The New York Times reported that Trump had asked McGahn to get the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and fired FBI Director Comey but that he had been rebuffed.\n\nThe paper, lifting the lid on extreme pressure faced by top law enforcement officials in the US government, also said Trump had repeatedly criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray for failing to more aggressively investigate Clinton, calling him weak.\n\nIt is not surprising that Trump would call for such prosecutions. He has frequently said as much on the campaign trail and on Twitter and beamed as his crowds chanted \"lock her up,\" referring to his 2016 election foe.\n\nBut that he would actually believe he has the power to follow through on his demands and such action would be politically acceptable is the most alarming takeaway from the reports.\n\nA prosecution of Clinton -- possibly over her private email server or an Obama-era uranium deal struck with Russia, both while she was secretary of state -- would have challenged the fundamentals of the political system itself. American democracy since George Washington, the first president, has been assured by the peaceful transfer of power between often bitter rivals. In a saga that became embroiled in the 2016 election, the FBI investigated Clinton's email use, but declined to recommend charges.\n\nMobilizing the government's prosecutorial powers against Comey would represent a vindictive swipe against a political enemy, a worrying sign in itself.\n\nBut it could also have led Trump onto perilous legal ground because he fired Comey and then told NBC News he had done so because of the Russia investigation -- which Comey was then leading -- raising concerns that the President had obstructed justice.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far Replay More Videos ...

This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said on \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\nComey wrote in his book \"A Higher Loyalty,\" which came out earlier this year, that Trump often reminded him of a mafia boss and sent him back to his days prosecuting the mob, especially with the President's demands for personal loyalty.\n\nRenewed scrutiny of Matt Whitaker\n\nThe latest revelations also cast new scrutiny on Whitaker, who is now acting attorney general, after Trump fired Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's elevation, and past criticism of the Mueller probe, sparked concerns that he was put in place to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nA source told CNN's Pamela Brown that Whitaker, in his former role, came to meetings with Trump prepared to answer how the Justice Department was pursuing investigations against the Clinton Foundation and on the Uranium One issue, over a mining company whose sale to Russia's atomic energy agency had been approved by the Obama administration while Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe source said Whitaker tried to appease the President and there was no sign that he had crossed a line.\n\nWhitaker is now in a role in which he oversees the Mueller probe, and thus could face intense pressure from a President who has made no secret of his disdain for an investigation he has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhen Trump first requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, the Times said. The paper also reported that McGahn had gone so far as to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a request.\n\nIn many ways, the latest reports underline how Trump, a neophyte in Washington when he was inaugurated in January 2017, does not appreciate or respect normal boundaries between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nThey also suggest how if he is not constrained, the President could accidentally stumble into a position that contravenes the Constitution and puts his presidency in jeopardy.\n\nThat possibility seems to be exacerbated by Trump's increasing self-confidence in a White House that may be about to be deprived of many remaining restraining influences in a government reshuffle.\n\nTuesday's reports recalled an exchange in a Clinton/Trump presidential debate in 2016, when the Democratic nominee remarked that it was good that someone with her rival's temperament wasn't running the country.\n\n\"Because you would be in jail,\" Trump replied."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Whitaker disclosures reveal more than $900,000 in payments from conservative group", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/B8kYAjjhNG8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker revised his financial disclosure forms five times after being appointed to the top Justice Department role earlier this month, according to the forms, which were released Tuesday.\n\nRevisions to disclosure filings are not uncommon, but the release of Whitaker's forms comes amid pressure from government watchdog groups who raised concerns in recent days about why their requests for the documents had gone unfulfilled.\n\nThe forms show that in the months before then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions hired him as chief of staff in 2017, Whitaker was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in salary from a conservative oversight group he founded in 2014.\n\nFinancial records show that The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, or FACT, received nearly all of its funding from a group called DonorsTrust, whose contributors are mostly anonymous but are known to include major Republican donor Charles Koch.\n\nWhitaker was paid a total of $904,000 over 2016 and most of 2017, according to his first disclosure form."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Don't eat romaine lettuce, CDC urges amid E. coli concerns", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/L5eJjqoKvEI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned US consumers on Tuesday to not eat romaine lettuce, as it may be contaminated with E. coli .\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC.

Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants also should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nA similar outbreak caused by contaminated romaine lettuce occurred in December, Gottlieb said, and affected the United States and Canada. \"The strain in 2017 is the same as the strain in this fall 2018 outbreak, and the time of year is exactly the same. So It's likely associated with end of season harvest in California,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different this year is that the FDA has higher confidence that it's romaine lettuce in both countries. \"This year, we're a month earlier, so we're earlier in the process, earlier in the throes of an outbreak,\" Gottlieb said. \"So we're able to actually get real-time information and conduct effective trace back and isolate what the source is.\"\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness.\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, according to the US Food and Drug Administration , which is also investigating the outbreak. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\n\"That's why we think it's critical to get this information out,\" Gottlieb said. \"We understand fully the impact this has, not just on the growers and the distributors but also on consumers -- consumers who are preparing meals for the holidays, who have product now that they're going to need to discard, maybe food that they've already cooked.\"\n\nHow does the US prevent foodborne illness?\n\nFoodborne illness hits one in six Americans every year, the CDC says, estimating that 48 million people get sick due to one or another of 31 pathogens. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die annually.\n\nPreventing foodborne illness in the United States is the job of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which oversees the meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and the FDA, responsible for domestic and imported foods.\n\nWith frequent news of outbreaks, which are investigated by the CDC, many people might wonder whether foodborne illness is on the rise -- and whether safety measures across the nation adequately protect our food supply.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the CDC has investigated 21 multistate foodborne illness outbreaks this year, more than any year in the past decade.\n\n\"I think that the issue isn't that there's more unsafe food,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think what's happening is that we have better technology than ever before to link outbreaks of human illness to a common pathogen.\"\n\nIn all 50 states, the CDC has the capacity to do genomic testing on samples from infected patients (such as blood samples). It also can genetically link the identified pathogens in human illness to actual food sources.\n\nWhat is lagging is the ability to do track and trace to a single distributor or grower \"because we don't have as good a technology as we would like in our supply chain,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother recent development in protecting the US food supply is the Food Safety Modernization Act , which became law in 2011. Gottlieb said the act represents a \"paradigm shift,\" as it is based on prevention instead of reaction.\n\n\"I think food is more safe now than it's ever been.

Before you prepare your favorite dishes, take a moment to review the food recalls and illness outbreaks identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRomaine lettuce\n\nJust two days before Thanksgiving, the CDC warned US consumers to not eat romaine lettuce , as it may be contaminated with E. coli.\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC. One of the hospitalized people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially life-threatening form of kidney failure.

The CDC announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported, though 21 people have been hospitalized, the public health agency reports. The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella illness usually begin 12 to 72 hours after consuming something tainted with the organism and last about four to seven days. They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC.

But the night before Turkey Day, informally known as \"Friendsgiving\" and \"Drinksgiving,\" may, anecdotally speaking, see more pub patrons.\n\nWith nearly everyone taking off the next day, Thanksgiving Eve is basically Friday night times three. Friends arriving from distant places will converge on the local watering hole, while local singles throng the same bar in the hopes of meeting someone before the holidays officially lift off. Hello, stranger!\n\nYour unofficial high school reunion or pre-turkey rager isn't necessarily something to be embarrassed about.\n\nNothing in print (or on screen) is likely to stop you from texting friends to arrange a pre-Turkey hang session, so take pleasure in the fact that your natural social instinct is a healthy one.\n\nBe grateful for friendships\n\nRecent research has repeatedly shown that strong friendships and social ties extend our lives , generally keep us healthier and keep our brains active and synapses firing.\n\n\"People who are more socially connected live longer than people who are less socially connected,\" said Julianne Holt-Lunstad , a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University. Whether your social network is measured in terms of the size or the extent to which you feel supported by it, people who have a wealth of friends live longer than those more socially impoverished, she adds.\n\nThis is more or less the consensus within the social sciences.\n\n\"Social relationships can vastly promote health -- and the lack thereof would be vastly detrimental to health,\" said Yang Claire Yang , a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"It's tremendous.\"\n\nYang adds that the positive impact of social relationships can be assessed by \"objectively measured\" physiological markers across our cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems. In fact, the amount our social relationships influence our mortality and health are comparable to -- if not exceeding, Yang says -- well-known factors such as physical activity and smoking.\n\nThe ways social connectedness influences health are practical and even logical, Holt-Lunstad explains.\n\n\"It's not just this weird correlation,\" she said. \"Just the extent you have others around and can provide assistance and resources and a sense of companionship. ... Even basic things like if you were to fall or have a medical emergency can make a huge difference in your outcome.\"\n\nAnother example: If all your friends are vegetarians who do yoga, this \"social norm\" will probably influence you to exercise and eat right, says Holt-Lunstad. Relationships also help you manage stress. Friends help buffer us from the world and help us \"talk out\" our problems. In other cases, our social links to, say, a religious group can provide much-needed aid or financial assistance in times of need.\n\nThat said, Holt-Lunstad notes there's also a dark side. \"Humans are complex, social relations are complex, and it's just not simple,\" she said.\n\nSome relationships can be a source of stress, while others may be a combination of both positive and negative. The people we have mixed feelings about, even if we love them, can be associated with detrimental physiological effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure or increased anxiety, says Holt-Lunstad.\n\nBut what about an annual gathering with friends home for the holidays: Is this just social junk food or a nutritious social meal?\n\n\"Seeing someone we don't get to see often might strengthen our bonds and feelings of connectedness,\" Holt-Lunstad said.\n\nYang agrees, so long as the people we socialize with \"actually promote or provide the kind of support and connection that you need.\"\n\n\"Having any is better than having none,\" Yang said. \"And having more is always better.\"\n\nOf course, more social connection is one thing; more time spent in the bar is another.\n\nBeware 'Blackout Wednesday'\n\nBartenders have their own name for Thanksgiving Eve: \"Blackout Wednesday.\" The annual gathering is a time when some people throw caution to the wind.\n\nThanksgiving dinner may be the ultimate hangover cure, but too much booze is never a good thing. In particular, binge drinking is terrible for your health. Defined as five or more drinks (within two hours) for a man and four or more drinks for a woman , binge drinking can lead to accidents, cardiovascular disease and liver disease.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThere's another danger, too: Late nights and early mornings between Thanksgiving Eve through New Year's include some of the most dangerous on the nation's highways and byways. Overall, in 2014, just shy of 10,000 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . These fatalities accounted for nearly one-third of all traffic-related deaths in the United States that year. Meanwhile, drugs other than alcohol were involved in about 16% of the total car crashes.\n\nThanksgiving weekend contributed more car crash deaths than the holiday periods surrounding New Year's, Christmas, Fourth of July and Memorial Day, according to the safety administration. Only Labor Day weekend topped Thanksgiving in car crash deaths last year.\n\nAlthough Friendsgiving can be a healthy way to start the holiday season, it's also an important time to know your limits -- even if that means staying home."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "A healthier Thanksgiving in 8 traditional, simple courses", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Rj-zMqz6qEY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is a time for feasting, certainly not fasting or dieting. But if you're kicking off the holiday season with your health in mind, there are a few smart switches you can make on Turkey Day that will help boost your nutrition and lighten your calorie load.\n\nBelow are some savvy substitutions that can help you save nearly 1,200 calories for the entire meal.\n\nRed wine instead of White Russian\n\nCalories in cocktails can add up quickly, thanks to sugary mixers, tonic, juice, soda and syrups. What's more, depending on the pour, mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol (that is, more than 1.5 ounces of vodka or gin), which also boosts calories.\n\nAn 8-ounce White Russian can top 500 calories, thanks to Kahl\u00faa, vodka and heavy cream, but a 5-ounce glass of red wine has about 125 calories, or about a quarter of the amount. If you prefer the higher-calorie cocktails, limit yourself to one.\n\nCarrots and hummus instead of cheese and crackers\n\nA couple of multigrain crackers with cheddar cheese has 134 calories -- not calorie overload, but compare that with two baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus, which has only 62 calories, plus 2 grams of fiber.\n\nYou can have double the portion for fewer calories if you choose crudit\u00e9 over cheese. If you prefer dips to hummus, try substituting Greek yogurt for sour cream to shave calories and boost protein.\n\nDark-meat turkey without skin instead of with skin\n\nTruth be told, dark-meat turkey is delicious and is typically juicier and more flavorful than white meat. Plus, dark meat delivers more zinc and iron than white meat.\n\nThere's no need to forgo dark meat this Thanksgiving. But skip the skin to save some calories and saturated fat. Dark meat with skin is 175 calories per 3-ounce serving, and without skin is 147 calories. For portion control, keep your serving to 3 ounces, which is similar in size to a deck of cards or a computer mouse.\n\nVegan mushroom gravy instead of traditional gravy\n\nTurkey may not seem like \"turkey\" without gravy, as the sauce gives a flavor upgrade to any dish. But making your gravy with mushrooms instead of meat drippings. can give your bird a savory \"umami\" flavor while saving a significant amount of calories and fat.\n\nTraditional gravy is 63 calories per quarter-cup, and vegan mushroom gravy is only 35 calories. And here's another bonus to mushroom gravy: Because it is meatless, it's suitable for vegan guests. Whatever gravy you choose, try using a tablespoon when serving yourself, instead of pouring from a gravy boat, to help control your portion size.\n\nWhole-grain stuffing with kale instead of traditional stuffing\n\nStuffing is delicious, but using white bread as an ingredient is a missed nutritional opportunity, as it doesn't offer the fiber and vitamins that whole-grain bread does. Try a stuffing made with whole wheat bread, oats or quinoa to boost the nutrients.\n\nThe New York Times' whole-grain stuffing with kale, figs, dates and hazelnuts has 7 grams of fiber and about 60 fewer calories per serving than a traditional stuffing. Traditional stuffing is about 420 calories per cup, while whole-grain stuffing with kale and dried fruit is 357 calories.\n\nBaked sweet potato instead of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows\n\nSweet potatoes are nutritious and delicious and can help you achieve smooth, glowing skin, as they are loaded with vitamin A. However, when you add brown sugar, butter and marshmallows, you're pretty much eating dessert.\n\nOne serving of candied sweet potato casserole with marshmallows packs 405 calories, 19 grams of fat and 32 grams of sugar. A whole baked sweet potato has only 130 calories and only 9 grams of natural sugar. You can even add some toasted marshmallows for an extra 30 calories.\n\nLow-fat green bean casserole instead of traditional green bean casserole\n\nTraditional green bean casserole is a Thanksgiving staple that is about 24 calories per cup, but the healthier eatingwell.com version with breadcrumbs instead of French fried onions has only 188 calories per cup.\n\nIf you like the traditional green bean casserole recipe, you can use fresher, lower-fat ingredients that will improve the healthfulness of the dish and the flavor. Simply substitute the French fried onions with fresh onions (you can bake them after soaking them in buttermilk and coating with breadcrumbs and flour), and use low-fat condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular version. You can also substitute low-fat milk (like 1%) for whole milk, which saves calories and saturated fat.\n\nPumpkin pie instead of pecan pie\n\nThere's no need to skip dessert, but by choosing pumpkin pie over pecan pie, you can save over 200 calories. Pecan pie is about 541 calories per slice, and pumpkin is 323 calories. Apple pie is another lower-calorie choice compared with pecan, at 363 calories per slice. If you can't resist pecan pie (and who could blame you), take a thin slice, or go crustless and eat only the filling. And hold off on the whipped cream!\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMake all these substitutes, and your total calorie savings is 1,179.

Over the past five years, after deciding that she wanted to feel and look better, she changed her eating and exercise habits and finally lost that leftover weight, and then maintained her new physique. But it hasn't come without challenges.\n\n\"Holidays are tough, man, really tough,\" she said. Unlike work gatherings, family celebrations are not problematic for Sanderson, who allows herself to enjoy the occasional splurge meal for what it is.\n\n\"Holiday gatherings at work are the most troublesome,\" she said. \"People bring in all these fatty, calorie-heavy foods, lots of desserts, and when you're looking at a buffet of 20 different things and there's only one plate of fruit, what are you supposed to do?\"\n\nMalkani points out that \"one meal is not going to make or break a nutritious lifestyle or a weight loss goal. What's more important is the totality of the nutrition lifestyle.\"\n\nThere are strategies to put in place when you find yourself facing a food pusher or diet saboteur.\n\nOne of Malkani's favorites involves preparing yourself. \"It sounds so simple, but it is sometimes difficult to do unless you've practiced -- but to have your simple, 'No, thank you' statement prepared. It can be polite, it can be charming, it can be whatever makes you feel comfortable, but to be prepared to say, 'No, thank you' ... is very important,\" Malkani said.\n\nAnother tip is having a healthy and nutritious meal or snack before attending an event so you are less tempted to overeat. And if you do slip up, remember that it's not the end of the world, as long as you go back to your normal habits.\n\nNotes for hosts\n\nIt's not just those focused on weight and lifestyle who can face problems when it comes to food pushers. However well-meaning the host, there are sometimes health risks related to eating something you don't normally consume.\n\n\"We know they come from a position of love, and we love them for who they are, but it is important, especially for those who have food allergies or intolerances or sensitivities [or] an autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease, to be able to set firm boundaries around foods that will cause a reaction,\" Malkani said.\n\n\"I usually just go and don't eat,\" Kendra Chapman says of holiday parties.\n\nKendra Chapman knows that the holiday season can be a risky time. \"I get invited to all of these holiday parties, and of course I want to go, and I always feel like I don't get the full experience of having the food and drinking the drinks and doing all the things,\" she said.\n\nhas more than 20 food allergies, including peanuts and citric acid. Some are deadly and can cause her to go into anaphylactic shock; others will cause stomach issues, hives and itching. After being diagnosed with most them just over three years ago, she started a blog, Chapman, 28, of Los Angeles,has more than 20 food allergies, including peanuts and citric acid. Some are deadly and can cause her to go into anaphylactic shock; others will cause stomach issues, hives and itching. After being diagnosed with most them just over three years ago, she started a blog, Nope, Can't Eat That Either , chronicling her experience.\n\n\"I think that well-meaning hosts prepare these beautiful meals, and oftentimes, it includes things that some of the guests can't eat,\" said Diane Gottsman , national etiquette expert and founder of the Protocol School of Texas . \"I'm not talking about things that make you sick. If you have a gluten intolerance, if you have a serious nut allergy, you just have to let the host know and don't feel any remorse about not eating it.\"\n\nAlthough Chapman doesn't think people sabotage her diet in a malicious way, there are times when she must remind them about her dietary requirements.\n\n\"One thing that happens a lot is, people forget,\" she said. This often happens with co-workers and new acquaintances. \"It's harmless. They aren't trying to force me to eat things. It's literally just that they forget.\"\n\nAfter she spends some time with people, though, they often become as protective of what she eats as she is.\n\n\"My family [is] very accommodating to me, but going to friends' houses, like holiday parties for instance, it's a nightmare,\" she said. \"I usually just go and don't eat, because people don't really understand the gravity of allergies, which is unfortunate because you're in a room full of 50 people, and you're the only one not eating.\"\n\nBYO dish\n\nFor Gottsman, everyone at an event -- be it a Thanksgiving meal or a Christmas party -- must be conscious of how people with allergies or dietary requirements feel.\n\n\"A gracious guest is not going to make another guest feel uncomfortable. And a gracious host and a good host will never want their guest to feel uncomfortable by making them feel uncomfortable for not eating,\" she said.\n\nHosts should try to have options available for guests who may have food allergies or intolerances, Gottsman said.\n\n\"They should offer some alternatives, such as a fruit tray or even a cheese tray, if you are nut-allergic. They should prepare in advance for restrictions. But also, they should ask the guests if there is anything they should be aware of,\" she said.\n\nHowever, these alternatives come with their own risks. Chapman also has to be aware of issues such as cross-contamination when she attends events.\n\n\"You'll have a spread of food, and one thing might be completely safe, but they'll have something at the other end of the table that's not, and people will use the same spoon or the same fork, and now I really can't eat it,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Chapman often doesn't eat at parties, one way to increase the potential food options is to contribute, according to Gottsman.\n\n\"You can let [the host] know in advance, 'Listen, I'm going to come, but ... I have some severe allergies, and I would love to bring a casserole that I can share with everyone,' \" she said.\n\nBringing your own dish also can be helpful if you're a vegan or vegetarian.\n\n\"Bring enough food for everybody, or bring enough food for five or 10 people, for part of the party,\" said Len Torine , executive director of the American Vegetarian Association\n\nBringing enough to share means that you have something to eat, and it keeps you from standing out.\n\nAs with other dietary requirements, there are times when the families and friends of those who are vegan or vegetarian don't sabotage on purpose.\n\n\"I am not sure If they meant to, but during Thanksgiving, there was gravy sitting out, and I asked, 'Is this vegetarian?' They replied 'yes,' probably thinking 'there is not meat in this.' Turns out there was chicken broth in it, and I ate it,\" Emma Huehns, a vegetarian in Wisconsin, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nHuehns, 17, started her vegetarian diet about a year ago and is the only non-meat-eater in her family.\n\nThough they are generally supportive -- her dad even went vegetarian for a week with her -- she still has some struggles.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I have also been told many times by my grandparents that chicken and fish isn't meat. [My grandmother] even tried to tell me that I could have something she made when it had meat in it, because she said it wouldn't hurt if I had just a little,\" she said.\n\nAlthough you may face some resistance from family or have to avoid certain foods being served at parties, for Torine, the main point of the holidays is to enjoy yourself and have fun with friends and family. For him, this means not explaining your diet choices or making them the central focus.\n\n\"You don't want to spoil anyone's party. You don't want to pontificate. You just say 'Thanks, I'll have it later, I'll just pass,' \" he said.\n\nAnd his advice for vegetarians on Thanksgiving? \"Be thankful for the salad,\" he said with a laugh."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Type 2 diabetes affects 7,000 under-25s in England and Wales", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46290849", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThere are nearly 7,000 children and young adults under 25 with type 2 diabetes in England and Wales - about 10 times the number reported before, according to Diabetes UK.\n\nIts analysis of 2016-17 data found most were being treated in GP practices rather than in specialist units.\n\nThe condition is linked to obesity and is more aggressive in children.\n\nChild health experts said the government should act now to implement proposals to cut childhood obesity.\n\nThe Obesity Health Alliance said it was \"hugely concerning\" to see so many young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\"We know that obesity contributes to the development of this and other serious health conditions, and with one in three children leaving primary school with excess weight or obesity, these findings are worrying but sadly not surprising,\" said Caroline Cerny, from the Alliance.\n\nThe new figures come from the latest National Diabetes Audit for 2016-2017 which contains information on cases of type 2 from 95% of GP practices in England and Wales, as well as numbers treated in specialist paediatric units.\n\nIt found that a total of 6,836 children and young people aged under 25 were being treated for the condition.\n\nThis includes:\n\n11 five to nine-year-olds\n\n196 10 to 14-year-olds\n\n1,246 15 to 19-year-olds\n\n5,383 20 to 24 year-olds\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stephen Richardson had to have his leg amputated because of type 2 diabetes\n\nBut a previous report, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, suggested the figure was 715 - the number of children and young people receiving care for type 2 diabetes from paediatric diabetes units in England and Wales.\n\nThese units provide specialist support to young people.\n\nSome may be at risk of the condition progressing quickly, creating other health complications, such as blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney failure.\n\nGPs also provide lifestyle advice and support and many young people are treated in primary care.\n\nFamily history and ethnic background, as well as obesity, are factors in children and young people developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\n\nIt is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high\n\nIt's caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin\n\nType 2 diabetes can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to pee a lot and tiredness\n\nIt can also increase the risk of getting serious problems with the eyes, heart and nerves\n\nIt's a lifelong condition which may mean a change in diet, medicine and regular check-ups\n\nBridget Turner, director of policy and campaigns at Diabetes UK, said: \"Type 2 diabetes can be devastating for children and young people.\n\n\"We need to encourage healthy living by providing clear and easy to understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.\"\n\nShe said children and young people with type 2 should have access to expert treatment from healthcare professionals trained to manage the condition.\n\n'Lifestyle changes'\n\nProf Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said these new figures emphasised the need to act.\n\n\"For many children, the development of type two diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes, but this isn't easy - they need support.\n\n\"That's why we were pleased to see the ambitious proposals set out in chapter two of its Childhood Obesity Plan.

in their hands, there is no armed element going in,\" Mr Mattis told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nHe said the military deployment along the Mexican border was to help protect border officials from possible threats.\n\nA convoy of almost 3,000 Central American migrants has arrived at the Mexican border city of Tijuana.\n\nThey say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.\n\nBut President Donald Trump has described the caravan of migrants hoping to cross into the US as an \"invasion\", and deployed about 5,800 troops to the southern border to \"harden\" it.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Mattis told reporters that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had not requested that troops use \"lethal force\", adding: \"Relax, don't worry about it.\"\n\nHe said troops, armed with batons and shields, may be given powers to temporarily detain migrants for \"minutes, not even hours\", but not the authority to arrest them.\n\n\"If someone's beating on a border patrolman, and if we were in a position to have to do something about it, we could stop them from beating on them and take them over and deliver them to a border patrolman who would then arrest them,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, a US federal judge blocked an order issued by Mr Trump to deny the possibility of asylum to migrants crossing the southern border illegally.\n\nWhat do the migrants want?\n\nThe migrants say they are leaving their respective countries in the hope of building a better future for themselves and their families.\n\nSome say they have been threatened or mistreated by criminal gangs operating in their hometowns. Many are travelling with their children whom they do not want to fall prey to the gangs.\n\nOthers hope to get jobs abroad which pay enough for them to send money to their relatives who stayed behind.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Migrants, part of the caravan, en route to the Mexican border city of Tijuana\n\nMany say their dream is to reach the US. Some of them have relatives there already whom they hope to join, others have chosen it as their destination because they think they will earn higher salaries there than in Latin America.\n\nWhile Central Americans have long fled their homelands for the US and have sometimes joined forces along the way, the organised nature of this caravan is relatively new.\n\nMigrants are often kidnapped by people traffickers and drugs gangs which force them to work for them.

river-dwellers that are able to self-heal their heart tissue, and cave-dwellers that cannot.\n\nThe cave fish, who once lived in the rivers of Northern Mexico, were washed into caves by floodwaters about 1.5 million years ago and evolved, losing their sight and colour because of living in perpetual darkness.\n\nComparing the two types of tetra fish, researchers found two genes - lrrc10 and caveolin - were much more active in the river fish following heart injury.\n\nHaving discovered this, they switched off the lrrc10 gene in a different species of fish with self-healing abilities, the zebrafish.\n\nWith this gene no longer working properly, the zebrafish became unable to fully repair its heart without scarring.\n\nScar tissue stops the heart muscle from contracting properly and reduces the heart's ability to pump blood around the body.\n\nBoth of these genes are present in humans, and lrrc10 is known to be linked to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nImage copyright BHF Image caption Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and a colleague in the cave where the fish live\n\nThe study authors say their findings suggest it will one day be possible to regenerate damaged hearts in people by artificially modifying how these and other genes function.\n\nThis could be done either with drugs or through gene-editing techniques, where DNA is modified, deleted or replaced, using tools like Crispr-Cas9.\n\nDr Mommersteeg, who's associate professor of developmental and regenerative medicine, said: \"I do believe that this fish can tell us, at some point, how we can really repair the human heart...\n\n\"It's early days but we're incredibly excited about these remarkable fish and the potential to change the lives of people with damaged hearts.\"\n\nBut she said more work is needed to find other key genes that may be involved in the heart regenerating.\n\nProf Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Survival rates for heart failure have barely changed over the last 20 years, and life expectancy is worse than for many cancers.\n\n\"Breakthroughs are desperately needed to ease the devastation caused by this dreadful condition.\"\n\nThe study has been published in Cell Reports.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "InSight: Nasa's Mars mission on target for landing", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46298259", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It takes 6.5 minutes to go from the top of the atmosphere to the surface\n\nThe American space agency Nasa says its InSight Mars lander is on a near-perfect Thanksgiving trajectory.\n\nThe probe is due to touch down on Monday at 19:53 GMT, to begin its quest to map the Red Planet's interior.\n\nEngineers can take the opportunity for one last course correction on Sunday to tighten the line to the bulls-eye -

If it can do that - and everything at present suggests it will - then it ought to come down right on top of a very flat landscape known as Elysium Planitia.\n\nThe task of atmospheric entry, descent and landing (EDL) is far from straightforward, however. Mission statistics show Mars to be unforgiving to the ill-prepared. Two-thirds of all landing attempts have failed.\n\nThe reason is simple: A probe will enter the atmosphere at six times the speed of a high-velocity bullet and then somehow have to slow to a controlled stop at the surface - all inside seven minutes. An EDL strategy has to be perfect.\n\nThe most recent effort in 2016 - from Europe - got it hopelessly wrong and slammed into the ground.\n\nThe Americans, though, have a pretty good record, and InSight will use the proven combination of a heat-resistant capsule, a parachute and rockets to make its drop to Mars.\n\nJulie Wertz-Chen is part of the InSight EDL team: \"We've done everything we can to try and be successful but it's a really, really difficult thing to do, to land on another planet. We never want to go into it saying 'Oh yeah, no problem, this will work easily!', because you just never know what Mars will throw at you.\"\n\nInSight aims to be the first mission to take a detailed look inside the Red Planet. It will use British and French seismometers to listen for earthquakes, or rather \"Marsquakes\".\n\nThese vibrations will help trace the interior rock layers - from the crust to the core.\n\n\"An earthquake is almost like a little flashbulb,\" explains InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt. \"It illuminates the inside of the planet with seismic waves, and the seismometer is like a camera that picks up those waves and helps put together a picture. Pixel by pixel we get to put together a 3D picture of the inside of a planet.\"\n\nScientists know very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Prince launches 'waste to wealth' summit", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46289234", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Rosie Tweedale and Toni Packham hold the duvet \"insulation\"\n\nWhile the world tackles plastic waste, some experts feel other forms of waste need attention too\u2026 like duvets.\n\nYes, duvets.

The fear of being extradited and tried in the US has forced him to seek refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012.\n\nThis news hardly came as a surprise to those of us who have been following his case or have been convinced that Assange's fate is of profound and historical importance and could define the future of the freedom of the press.\n\nWhat happens if Assange is tried in US\n\nThere are some in the West who are fully convinced that Assange deserves to be tried and thrown in jail for \"threatening\" US national security and \"undermining\" its democratic processes. Former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Joe Biden have called him a \"terrorist\", US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, then the director of the CIA, has described WikiLeaks as a \"non-state hostile intelligence service\" and US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said prosecuting Assange is a \"priority\" for him.\n\nMany have also come to see him as a political player who purposefully sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential elections, while others consider him a stooge of Russian President Vladimir Putin, although no evidence for this was ever found. It is more likely that Assange's indictment is coming not as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 US election, but in response to WikiLeaks publishing the biggest leak in the history of the CIA called #Vault7.\n\nWhatever Assange's political leanings or views, his case is not about whether you like him or not, but about freedom of the press. As Edward Snowden rightly said: \"You can despise WikiLeaks and everything it stands for. You can think Assange is an evil spirit reanimated by Putin himself, but you cannot support the prosecution of a publisher for publishing without narrowing the basic rights every newspaper relies on.\"\n\nIf Assange is eventually arrested, extradited to the US and stands trial there, he is almost certainly going to be found guilty - just as Chelsea Manning was - and he would probably end up in a Guantanamo-like prison. His prosecution and jailing would have global repercussions for whistle-blowers, publishers and journalists.\n\nAccording to US lawyer and civil liberties advocate Ben Wizner at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU): \"Any prosecution of Mr Assange for WikiLeaks' publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations\".\n\nIn other words, a lawsuit that tries to make it illegal or a form of \"espionage\" to publish documents would set a dangerous precedent for publishers and journalists who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest. It would endanger the very foundation of free press.\n\nWhy this is important for all of us\n\nWe already live in a world in which politics and distribution of information are being profoundly transformed. Not only do dangerous populists and authoritarian leaders come to power by \"manufacturing consent\", backed by the use of \"perception management\" methods by tech companies or organised fake news campaigns, but they also come to power by openly spreading misinformation and concealing information of public interest.\n\nWhile it became \"natural\" for politicians to employ such questionable methods to reach power, it is the job of journalists, the media and whistle-blowers to keep such behaviour in check. Punishing them for doing their job - uncovering uncomfortable truths that those in power would like to keep away from the public - means removing one of the most important checks on executive political power.\n\nHow would we know today of the wiretapping of the Democratic Party headquarters if it hadn't been for the hard work of American investigative reporters uncovering information the Nixon administration wanted to hide? How would we know about all the offshore accounts and money laundering activities of politicians across the world if a whistle-blower hadn't leaked the Panama papers? How would we know how many Reuters journalists were killed by the US army in Iraq, as revealed by the \"Collateral Murder\" video leaked by Chelsea Manning and published by WikiLeaks? And how would we know how the Democratic Party treats some of its most progressive members, such as Bernie Sanders, if WikiLeaks hadn't released the files from the hacked Democratic National Committee email server?\n\nAssange had in his hands information of immoral political behaviour by a party and he published it. One can argue about timing and political consequences, but it is hard to deny that it was in the interest of the American public to know these facts. The information was not fake or fabricated; it was the truth.\n\nA criminal trial for Assange in the US would be another blow to journalists, the media and publishers who are already suffering from increasing pressure across the world. So far this year, 45 journalists have been killed across the world.\n\nIn March, Slovak investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee were shot in their home. In April, nine Afghan journalists were killed in a bombing in Kabul: Abadullah Hananzai, Ali Saleemi, Ghazi Rasooli, Maharram Durrani, Nowroz Ali Rajabi, Sabawoon Kakar, Saleem Talash, Shah Marai and Yar Mohammad Tokhi. In July, three Russian journalists were shot dead in the Central African Republic while investigating the presence of Russian mercenaries: Aleksandr Rastorguyev, Orkhan Dzhemal and Kirill Radchenko. And just over a month ago, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered in the consulate of his own country in Istanbul.\n\nClear signals are being sent to media professionals across the world that doing their jobs could cost them their freedom or their lives. Feeding this hostile environment instead of standing up to it could be dangerous not only for journalists and whistle-blowers but also for all of us.\n\nWalter Lippmann, the father of modern journalism who coined the phrase \"manufacturing consent\" (which Noam Chomsky made famous in his 1988 book) wrote back in 1919 in a thin volume called Liberty and the News that \"there can be no liberty for a community which lacks the means by which to detect lies\".\n\nFighting the extradition of Assange to the US is not just about protecting his individual rights, but it is also about protecting the very means by which we are able to detect lies. It is about protecting freedom of the press and our ability to keep checks on political power.\n\nWhatever you might think of WikiLeaks, it is a fact that as a publisher who protects its sources it has always been detecting and revealing lies.\n\nAnd as Lippman wrote in Liberty and the News 100 years ago: \"Not what somebody says or somebody wishes to be true, but what is so beyond all opinions, constitutes, the touchstone of our sanity.\"\n\nWithout WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, without the courageous whistle-blowers and journalists who are revealing the dirty secrets and immoral acts of powerful regimes, who are opposing or criticising authority, truth would quickly lose value. And it would be then that we would also lose the touchstone of our sanity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

But the killing of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez sparked outrage on both sides of the border and came at a time when the agency was increasingly scrutinized for its use of force.\n\nProsecutors said Swartz was frustrated over repeated encounters with people on the Mexico side of the border fence who throw rocks at agents to distract them from smugglers. They say he lost his cool and fatally shot Elena Rodriguez. Swartz fired about 16 rounds, and the boy was hit at least 10 times in the back and head.\n\nSwartz has said he was following his training and defending himself and other law enforcement officers from rocks, which he said could be deadly.\n\nProsecutors acknowledge that Elena Rodriguez was throwing rocks at agents while two smugglers made their way back to Mexico, but they said that wasn\u2019t justification for taking his life.\n\nChapman said Elena Rodriguez endangered the lives of the agents and a police officer who was on scene.\n\nTroops at the border\n\nThe verdict comes as President Donald Trump has deployed troops to the border to support U.S. authorities in response to a migrant caravan from Central America. The troops have been given authority to protect Border Patrol agents and other personnel, even though there have been no instances of violence against U.S. authorities.\n\nSwartz still faces a civil rights lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the teen\u2019s mother.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said prosecutors haven\u2019t decided whether to try Swartz again on the voluntary manslaughter charge."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Oldest US Military Survivor of Pearl Harbor Dies at Age 106", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/oldest-us-military-survivor-of-pearl-harbor-dies-at-age-106/4669096.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "The oldest U.S. military survivor of the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor that plunged the United States into World War II has died at age 106.\n\nRay Chavez's daughter, Kathleen Chavez of Poway, California, tells The Associated Press her father died in his sleep Wednesday.\n\nChavez had visited Washington in May where he was honored by President Donald Trump during Memorial Day services.\n\nHe was assigned to the minesweeper USS Condor when Japanese war planes bombed Pearl Harbor.\n\nHours before the attack, he and others had spotted a Japanese submarine near the harbor and notified a destroyer, which sunk it.\n\nSoon after, his ship docked, and he returned to his nearby home.

For Augie Siriano, they all were friends. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was leading Shabbat services when the gunshots rang out.\n\n\n\nBarely three weeks after the Tree of Life massacre \u2014 believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history \u2014 they and their fellow Pittsburghers are preparing to mark a holiday built around gratitude. But in the neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, they aren't shying away from celebrating Thanksgiving. They're welcoming it.\n\n\"It's really a perfect time that Thanksgiving is falling right now,'' Myers says. The holiday, he says, is about family \u2014 and spending time with loved ones is needed at a time like this.\n\n\n\nAnd in the concentric circles of grief and healing around him \u2014 Tree of Life, Squirrel Hill and the city of Pittsburgh itself \u2014 the sentiment is similar.\n\n\n\n\"[With] Thanksgiving coming so closely on the heels of the shooting, people feel the need to be around family more,'' says Dan Iddings, owner of Classic Lines, a bookstore about a half-mile from the synagogue. He will celebrate Thanksgiving with about 20 family and friends, and he expects it to be \"a very family- and community-centered Thanksgiving, more so than in the past few years.''\n\n\n\nHow do you summon thankfulness in a family, in a community, when the wounds are so fresh and the grief so hard to bear? When what you've lost is so profound, how do you sit down around a holiday spread and enjoy what you have? To talk to people in Squirrel Hill this week \u2014 those directly affiliated with Tree of Life and those who compose the community around it \u2014 is to begin to understand the different forms that gratitude can take.\n\n\n\nSiriano, Tree of Life's custodian since 1993, was in the synagogue restroom when he heard gunshots Oct. 27. He rushed out to see one of the worshippers, someone he had shared tea with 10 minutes earlier, lying dead. On Thursday, he will be with family. He says he has much to be thankful for, including a grandson born Saturday.\n\n\n\n\"There has to be a place in your heart for the sadness and the joy,'' says Rabbi Chuck Diamond, Tree of Life's former rabbi who led a \"healing'' service outside the synagogue a week after the shooting.\n\n\n\n\"We recognize and acknowledge what we have lost, but, at the same time, looking around the table, we recognize what we have,'' Diamond says. \"People should observe Thanksgiving and appreciate the comfort and joy of the family around them.''\n\nFeldstein understands the difficulty in celebrating the holiday less than a month after tragedy visited the neighborhood where he has owned a bagel shop for the past 28 years. Seven of the slain worshippers were Bagel Factory regulars, as were two of the Pittsburgh police officers injured in the shooting.\n\n\n\n\"You feel a bit guilty,'' Feldstein says. \"It's a difficult feeling. But you still have to make your kids appreciate what they have, so when they have children, you want them to feel that appreciation. I love my family. To me, that's the best time.''\n\n\n\nThe shooting took place in Squirrel Hill, the center of Jewish life in the city as well as home to churches, ethnic eateries, grocery stores, delis, pizzerias and a movie theater. The violence shook the neighborhood, and much of the city around it, to its foundations.\n\n\n\nA makeshift memorial bearing the 11 victims' names stood outside the synagogue until recently and drew thousands of visitors. Steel barricades now line the entrance to the synagogue, and the memorial sits inside, where two other congregations \u2014 New Light and Dor Hadash \u2014 also had gathered when the shooting occurred.\n\nThe crowds have thinned, but people still stop to pay respects. Bouquets of flowers and cards lean on hedges outside the synagogue. Someone left a pair of gold-painted Converse tennis shoes; written in English was the Hebrew and Arabic phrase, \"Peace be unto you.''\n\n\n\nMargaret Porter of Heath, Ohio, was in town to celebrate Thanksgiving with her son, a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, they felt compelled to bring flowers to the synagogue. \"I would say we're more thankful this Thanksgiving,'' Porter said.\n\nWhat makes Pittsburgh's Jewish community special is how different denominations interact with such ease, say Daniel and Baila Cohen, who recently took over ownership of of Pinskers Books and Judaica, as well as the adjoining cafe, in Squirrel Hill.\n\n\n\n\"Here, people know each other. They'll be part of different synagogues,'' Baila Cohen says. \"We are comfortable in all of them.''\n\n\n\nAdds her husband: \"There's a lot of crossover.''\n\n\n\nAnother reason that so many here are grateful on this holiday: the support the Jewish community received from the city, nation and throughout the world.\n\n\n\nAt Bagel Factory, people have shelled out hundreds of dollars in advance to pay for food for complete strangers. A store refused to charge for a Thanksgiving turkey when the owner learned the customer worked for Diamond. New Light, which lost three of its members in the shooting, has received thousands of letters from all over the world \u2014 all of them personal.\n\n\n\n\"People, not just Jews, were touched by this. The outreach from other religious communities has been overwhelming,'' says New Light co-president Stephen Cohen. He has been welcome, he notes, at services at a black church, a mosque and a Hindu temple.\n\n\n\nEvery business in Squirrel Hill has some sign of support in its window, be it murals of love, kindness and hope, or placards reading, \"Stronger than hate,'' \"Our hearts cry for Shalom,'' or \"Love our neighborhood. No place for hate.''\n\n\n\nCrocheted or knitted Stars of David hang from bare branches, sign posts and doorways throughout the business district. A sixth-grader from Arkansas scribbled, \"God loves you. You are in our prayers,'' on the back of a leather heart, on which a Star of David made from ice pop sticks was pasted. A sign thanks people for participating in an act of Tikum Olam, the Jewish concept of repairing the world.\n\n\n\n\"So many people have walked up to me and said, \u2018What can I do for you? What do you need?' '' New Light's Stephen Cohen says.\n\n\n\nHis congregation, like Dor Hadash and Tree of Life, found new locations for their services. And in those new places, during these very jumbled days, they are finding new ways of giving thanks.\n\n\n\nThey are the same community, marking the same American holiday as they did last November, but they find themselves with a new landscape to navigate \u2014 a landscape of grief, hope and, to hear many of them tell it, gratitude.\n\n\n\n\"The first thing you do is change the venue,'' Stephen Cohen says. \"Then, you come together. We spend a lot of time together. \u2026 That's how you get past things like this. Maybe.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Migrants in Tijuana Hopeful About Entering US Despite Homeland Security Warnings", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-in-tijuana-hopeful-about-entering-us-despite-homeland-security-warnings/4669043.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has warned Central American migrants seeking political asylum at the U.S. border with Mexico that the Trump administration will not tolerate \"frivolous asylum claims\" or illegal entry.

She'll join what may be the chamber's smallest group of female GOP lawmakers since the early 1990s \u2014 as few as 13 of at least 199 Republicans. Democrats will have at least 89.\n\n\n\nNumbers like those have Republicans searching for answers to the glaring gender disparity in their ranks \u2014 and fast. The concern is that Democrats' lopsided edge among female voters could carry over to 2020, when President Donald Trump will be seeking a second term and House and Senate control will be in play. If the current trend continues, Republicans risk being branded the party of men.\n\n\n\n\"You will see a very significant recruiting effort occur'' for female candidates, said David Winston, a pollster who advises GOP congressional leaders. \"It's a natural conclusion. An environment has got to be created where that can be a success.''\n\n\n\nEvidence of the GOP gender gap was just as clear in the 100-member Senate, where Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn will be the only Republican freshman. If Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith wins a runoff later this month there will be record-setting seven GOP women in the Republican-run Senate. But even that record is less than half the class of 17 Democratic women, which includes two freshmen.\n\n\n\nThe search for answers leads to some familiar places. Trump's fraught history with women, combined with the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment, helped motivate Democratic women to seek office but did not appear to have the same effect with GOP women, politicians and analysts say. More broadly, the president's brash style doesn't sit well many female voters or potential candidates.\n\n\"Women don't like the tweets,'' said Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a moderate GOP group. \"I don't know how to tone down the rhetoric. If I could have a fantasy, one wish, that would be my one wish.''\n\n\n\nWomen backed Democratic candidates over Republicans on Election Day by a telling 57 percent to 41 percent, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press. Women broke by similar margins in the crucial suburbs, where Democratic victories in swing districts helped power the gains they needed to win House control. Men supported Republicans over Democrats, 51 percent to 46 percent.\n\n\n\nStrategists note the issue isn't just about current personalities; it's about party infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\"We as a party have to make recruiting women candidates who can win a high priority,'' said Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for Winning for Women, a fledging GOP group that tries bolstering female Republican candidates. She added, \"Unless people in leadership really make it a priority, I don't think it will happen.''\n\n\n\nA record number of women ran for the House as major-party candidates this year. But Democrats outnumbered Republicans by nearly 3 to 1, according to AP data, and Democratic women were more likely to win their primaries.\n\n\n\nOf those contenders who ran in November, 183 were Democrats, the most ever, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Fifty-two were Republicans, a near-record but far smaller than the number of female Democrats running.\n\n\n\nThat partisan imbalance was made greater by Democrats' superior campaign infrastructure for helping female candidates.\n\n\n\nWinning for Women, created in early 2017, says it spent more than $1 million helping female candidates for the recent election. That and other GOP groups assisting female candidates couldn't match Democrats' 33-year-old Emily's List, a well-financed organization that poured tens of millions into primaries and general elections and provided recruiting, training and other services to female candidates.\n\n\"Democrats have been doing a much better job of getting women elected,'' said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics.\n\n\n\nAsked to explain her success against other female candidates' defeats, West Virginia's Miller sent an email lauding Trump and other Republicans and GOP women's groups and saying \"liberal special interests'' had spent heavily to defeat Republican women. Officials at the White House and the GOP did not provide answers to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have displayed a sensitivity this year to their overwhelmingly male numbers. That includes hiring a female prosecutor to question Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's chief accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and its all-male Republicans about her allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nWithin days of the elections, Republicans vaulted women into congressional leadership positions.\n\n\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, will be No. 3 House GOP leader next year, that chamber's highest-ranking Republican woman ever. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, will be vice chairwoman of the Senate GOP conference, a lower-tier post, making her the first Republican woman in a Senate leadership job in eight years.\n\n\n\nCheney said Republicans must better communicate that their policies on national security, the economy and health care are best for men and women. She called it \"fundamentally offensive and paternalistic'' to think women's votes are driven by their gender.\n\n\n\nAsked on CBS's Face the Nation last week whether Trump's rhetoric alienated women, Ernst said, \"We could do a better job of communicating clearly that we support women.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Right-Leaning Nonprofit Paid Whitaker More Than $1.2 Million", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/right-leaning-nonprofit-paid-whitaker-more-than-1-2-million/4668534.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Before joining the Justice Department, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker earned more than $1.2 million from a right-leaning nonprofit that doesn't disclose its donors, according to the nonprofit's tax filings. Whitaker's earnings represented a sizable chunk of the charity's revenue.\n\nFinancial disclosure forms released Tuesday show Whitaker received $904,000 in income from the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust from 2016 through nearly the end of 2017. He also received $15,000 from CNN as a legal commentator, according to the documents released by the Justice Department.\n\nThe nonprofit group, known as FACT, styles itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group is supposed to serve the public interest without supporting or opposing specific candidates for office. However, its challenges and its website have focused largely, though not exclusively, on Democrats and their party.\n\nWhitaker used his role as president and executive director of FACT in 2016 as a platform to question the ethics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nFrom 2014 through 2016, FACT paid out nearly 30 percent of its total revenue to Whitaker. In 2015 alone, Whitaker's $252,000 salary made up half of what the group brought in. Whitaker's salary also grew each year from $63,000 in 2014 to as much as $502,000 in 2017, according to the tax filings and public financial disclosures released by the Justice Department.\n\nSeparately, Whitaker is also facing criticism about whether he violated federal law because a campaign committee set up for his failed 2014 U.S. Senate bid accepted $8,800 in donations this year, while Whitaker was serving as a top Justice Department lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., called for an investigation into whether Whitaker violated the Hatch Act, a statute that generally prohibits executive branch employees from accepting or soliciting campaign donations.\n\nWhitaker's campaign committee, which still carries about $49,000 in debt, hadn't received any contributions between 2015 through 2017, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nThe campaign committee, Whitaker for U.S. Senate Inc., also reported paying $500 to Whitaker's old law firm, Whitaker, Hagenow & Gustoff, for space rental on Febraury 2. The campaign paid a $228 reimbursement to Christopher Hagenow \u2014 an Iowa legislator and founding partner of the law firm \u2014 for data services that same day.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Associated Press, and outside groups had requested Whitaker's financial disclosure forms from the Justice Department after President Donald Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and elevated Whitaker to the agency's top post on Nov. 7.\n\nThose documents show Whitaker began revising his public disclosures the day he was appointed acting attorney general. He revised the forms four more times, including on Tuesday.\n\nIn a disclosure form Whitaker completed when he joined the Justice Department in September 2017, he reported receiving $1,875 in legal fees from a company called World Patent Marketing. Whitaker has come under scrutiny for his involvement with the company, which was accused of misleading consumers and is under investigation by the FBI.\n\nWhitaker also disclosed his partial interest in a family farm in Ely, Iowa, that he valued at between $100,000 and $250,000. The forms also included disclosures of $20,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt in 2017.\n\nFACT drew its funds from 2014-2016 mainly from Donor's Trust, another nonprofit designed to provide anonymity to conservative and libertarian donors. Though such tax-exempt groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been criticized by Democrats who have challenged its constitutionality and are concerned that he will interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate's top Democrat, Sen.

The results were published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nAlthough arts, design, entertainment, sports and media had the highest suicide rates among women, this category saw the biggest increase in suicide rate among men during the study. For women, the biggest increase in suicide rates was in the food service industry.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that it didn't examine suicide methods. It also excluded two groups of Americans that typically have stressors that can increase their risk of suicide: military veterans and unemployed people.\n\nEven so, the results suggest that employers can play a role in suicide prevention by offering worksite wellness programs, encouraging use of behavioral and mental health services, and training workers in the warning signs of suicide and how to respond, Stone said.\n\nPromoting social interaction rather than isolation in daily tasks on the job may also help with suicide prevention, along with creating a workplace culture of inclusion that does not allow for abusive conduct or bullying, Namie said.\n\nThe road to suicide begins when one employee begins a \u201csystematic campaign of interpersonal destruction against another employee,\" Namie said. \"Bullying is the most preventable predictor of suicide.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "CDC Says US Abortion Rate Fell to Decade Low in 2015", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cdc-says-us-abortion-rate-fell-to-decade-low-in-2015/4668575.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "A U.S. government agency said Wednesday that abortion rates among American women of all ages fell to a decade low in 2015, which both opponents and supporters of abortion rights attributed in part to individual states' efforts to restrict women's access to the procedure.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that statistics for 2015, the most recent year for which data are available, showed the abortion rate was 11.8 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44.

As\n\nthey move towards the collectors, the ions collide with air molecules, transferring energy to them. This creates a flow of air that gives the plane its thrust.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the test flights at the duPont Athletic Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will become historic like the 1903 test flights of the first airplane by Wilbur and Orville Wright at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. And the engineers readily acknowledge their V2 prototype is inefficient\n\nand limited.\n\nBut it could lead to big things.\n\n\"I'm trying not to over-sell it, but there are some really exciting possibilities here,\" said Barrett, who pointed to near-silent drones as a possibility within several years.\n\n\"In the long term, I'm hoping for ultra-efficient and nearly silent airplanes that have no moving control surfaces like rudders or elevators, no moving propulsion system like propellers or turbines, and no direct combustion emissions like you get with burning jet fuel,\" added Barrett, who led the\n\nresearch published in the journal Nature.\n\nThe researchers conducted 11 test flights in which V2 flew about 200 feet (60 meters), typically flying less than 6-1/2 feet (2 meters) off the ground.\n\nThe plane, defined as a solid-state machine because it has no moving parts, was built to be as light as possible using materials like carbon-fiber, balsa wood, a plastic called polystyrene, shrink-wrap plastic and Kevlar."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "SpaceX's Crew Rocket Set for January Test Flight", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/spacex-s-crew-rocket-set-for-january-test-flight/4668460.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The first flight of a SpaceX rocket tailored to fly astronauts to the International Space Station is set for liftoff from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on January 7, NASA said on Wednesday.\n\nThe launch test is a crucial milestone in the space agency's Commercial Crew Program, which aims to launch humans to space from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft \u2014 which will shuttle three astronauts to space from the same launch pad that sent Apollo 11's three-man crew to the moon in 1969 \u2014 will make its debut flight atop SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket on January 7.\n\nWhile NASA did not detail the flight path, it said the test would provide data on the performance of the Falcon 9, Crew Dragon capsule, and ground systems, as well as on-orbit, docking and landing operations.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing Co are the two main contractors selected under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to send astronauts to space as soon as 2019, using their Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner spacecraft respectively.\n\nSince the U.S. space shuttle program was shut down in 2011, NASA has had to rely on Russia to fly astronauts to the space station, a $100 billion orbital research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth.\n\nThe Demo-1 launch is the latest test in a rigorous certification timeline imposed under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. While SpaceX is targeting early January, NASA spokeswoman Marie Lewis said the demo mission could be pushed back because \"flying safely has always taken precedence over schedule.\"\n\nFounded by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, SpaceX said if the January 7 test is successful, it plans to launch its first crewed mission in June 2019, but the timeline may shift.\n\nBoeing plans a similar test launch of the Starliner spacecraft atop its Atlas 5 rocket as soon as March, with a crewed mission following in August.\n\nThe Jan. 7 launch date announcement comes a day after NASA said it would conduct a \"cultural assessment study\" of the companies, \"including the adherence to a drug-free environment,\" prior to crew test flights."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Free Clinics Fill Huge Gaps in US Health Care System", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/free-health-clinics/4667622.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "On a cold and rainy Saturday morning, hundreds of people have camped out all night in cars or huddled in sleeping bags, splayed out in a school parking lot that has been turned into a makeshift medical clinic in Charleston, West Virginia.\n\nBy the time the doors open at 6 a.m., some will have been waiting for at least 14 hours to receive medical, dental, and vision care at this free mobile health clinic. Most here say they have no other health care option.\n\n\"I've never had health insurance - never,\" says Benny Cardenas, a construction worker who constantly worries he is an injury away from being in long-term debt. \"This here, it's free. It's worth the sacrifice - a couple hours of no sleep (rather) than paying thousands of dollars.\"\n\nSusan Stephenson, a truck driver from Houston, Texas, is already missing most of her upper teeth. Though she has medical insurance, she can't afford to go to the dentist. \"The copay is so outrageous, it's like not having insurance at all,\" says Stephenson, who drove four hours to attend the RAM Clinic.\n\nInsurance problems persist\n\nStephenson's story is common. Most Americans get health insurance through their employers, or through government-provided insurance for older and lower-income people. Millions of other people have received health insurance in recent years under the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. But many still cannot afford basic dental or vision services.\n\nSince the 2010 passage of the legislation known as \"Obamacare,\" the uninsured rate has fallen from 16 percent to less than 9 percent, according to figures by the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut 23 percent of Americans have no dental coverage, according to the National Association of Dental Plans.\n\nEven with insurance, costs can be prohibitive. Over 44 percent of Americans report difficulty paying for dental care and 11 percent of adults age 18-64 have foregone needed dental work altogether because of costs, according to a recent CDC study.\n\nAshley Bowman, who needs two cavities filled, has a state-subsidized health care plan, but it doesn't include dental coverage. \"I'm not sure why,\" she says. \"It just doesn't.\"\n\nSo she's huddled under an awning with several of her friends in the middle of the night - a small price to pay, she insists. \"Just for one filling, that's already half your rent! That's a lot just for one tooth.\"\n\nPartisan deadlock over voters' top issue\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, health care is a major priority for U.S. voters. According to exit polls taken during midterm elections, 41 percent of voters identified health care as their top concern - beating out every other issue, including immigration and the economy.\n\nIt's not hard to see why. The U.S. spends approximately twice what other high-income nations do on health care, yet has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest life expectancy, according to a March study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe high costs are not because Americans are getting more medical care. Rates of doctor visits are roughly equal to the 10 other countries in the study. Instead, it concluded health spending is being driven by factors including the steep costs of prescription drugs, administrative tasks, and physician and nurse salaries.\n\nBut any legislative movement on health care appears more unlikely than ever after the election, which saw Democrats take back the House of Representatives, creating a divided Congress.\n\nMany Republicans have called for a complete repeal of Obamacare, but would not be able to get such a plan through the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nMore liberal-leaning Democrats have increasingly proposed a \"Medicare for All\" program to expand government-run health care plans to cover all Americans. But Republicans fiercely oppose the proposal, saying it amounts to an inefficient government takeover of health care.\n\nRAM filling the gap\n\nAmid the partisan deadlock, privately-funded clinics like the one in West Virginia continue to provide free health care to as many people as they can across the country.\n\nEach year, Remote Area Medical operates more than 60 mobile medical clinics. About 90 percent are in the U.S., mostly in rural areas.\n\nRAM founder Stan Brock started holding the clinics in the 1980s in developing Latin American countries, such as Guyana, Mexico, and Haiti. It didn't take long before he realized one of the biggest needs was at home.\n\n\"You can blindfold yourself and put your finger on the map of the U.S. and we could go there and this will happen there,\" says RAM's Robert Lambert. \"The need is just huge.\"\n\nAt this two-day clinic in Charleston, RAM provided about $300,000 worth of free medical care to 775 patients. That figure may be small when compared to the vastness of U.S. health care problems. But for people here, it's a lifesaver.\n\n\"If I didn't have a place like this to get my glasses, I'd be totally lost,\" says Rosemary Pauley, a retiree who says she's \"blind as a bat.\"\n\n\"I'd be sitting at home doing nothing,\" she says."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Solar-powered Suitcases Bring Light to Darkened Classrooms", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/solar-powered-suitcases-bring-light-to-darkened-classrooms/4669044.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nSolar-powered suitcases are bringing light to darkened classrooms and struggling students in rural Kenya.

Questions these days aren't so much about whether she'll run for the Senate or even president, but whether she ought to keep her job at Facebook.\n\n\u201cHer brand was being manicured with the same resources and care as the gardens of Tokyo,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor. \u201cAnd unfortunately a hurricane has come through the garden.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been dealing with hurricanes for the past two years: fake news, elections interference, hate speech, a privacy scandal, the list goes on. The company's response \u2014 namely, Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's \u2014 has been slow at best, misleading and obfuscating at worst, as The New York Times reported last week. That report, and one from The Wall Street Journal , underscored Sandberg's influence at the company, even as Zuckerberg has borne much of the criticism and anger. There have been calls for both to be ousted.\n\nBut because of the way Facebook is set up, firing Zuckerberg would be all but impossible. He controls the majority of the company's voting stock, serves as its chairman and has \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 the support of its board of directors. Essentially, he'd have to fire himself. Firing Sandberg would be the next logical option to hold a high-level executive accountable. Though the chances are slim, the fact that it has even come up shows the extent of Facebook's \u2014 and Sandberg\u2019s \u2014 troubles.\n\nAs chief operating officer, Sandberg is in charge of Facebook's business dealings, including the ads that make up the bulk of the company's revenue. She steered Facebook from a rising tech startup into a viable global business expected to reap $55 billion in revenue this year. The company is second only to Google in digital advertising.\n\nBut she's also gotten the blame when things go wrong, including Facebook's failure to spot Russian attempts to influence U.S. elections by buying U.S. political ads \u2014 in rubles. Though Sandberg has denied knowing that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to discredit activists, she created a permissive environment through what the Times called an \u201caggressive lobbying campaign\u201d against critics. Facebook fired the firm, Definers, after the Times report came out.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Sandberg or make her available for an interview. A representative instead pointed to Zuckerberg's remarks that overall, \u201cSheryl is doing great work for the company. She's been a very important partner to me and continues to be, and will continue to be. She's leading a lot of the efforts to improve our systems in these areas.\u201d\n\nSandberg, 49, who was hired away from Google in 2008, has been a crucial \u201cheat shield\u201d for Zuckerberg, as Galloway put it, as lawmakers and the public crank up criticism of the 34-year-old founder. In September, Facebook sent Sandberg to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, eliciting a warmer response than her boss did three months before.\n\nSandberg, former chief of staff for treasury secretary Larry Summers, appears more comfortable in Washington meeting rooms than Zuckerberg, who can seem robotic. Her profile is high enough that lawmakers don't feel stilted when she shows up. She's written (with help) two books, including 2013's \u201cLean In\u201d about women and leadership. Her second book, \u201cPlan B,\u201d is about dealing with loss and grief after her husband died unexpectedly. She was the lone chief operating officer among a who's who of tech CEOs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 to meet with Donald Trump a month after his election.\n\n\u201cIt's both who she is and how bereft Silicon Valley is of strong, powerful female voices,\u201d crisis management expert Richard Levick said. \u201cShe has positioned herself as one of those strong voices with \u2018Lean In.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nBut her high profile also makes her more susceptible to criticism.\n\nThe chorus for Sandberg to leave is getting louder. CNBC commentator Jim Cramer predicted Monday that Facebook's stock would rise if Sandberg leaves or gets fired. NYU's Galloway believes both Sandberg and Zuckerberg should be fired for allowing Facebook to turn into an entity that harms democracy around the world.\n\n\u201cEvery day executives are fired for a fraction of infractions these two have committed,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides elections interference, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been criticized for their slow response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining firm accessed millions of users' private information without their permission. The pair were silent for days after the news came out.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Zuckerberg told Sandberg this spring that he blamed her and her teams for the \u201cpublic fallout\u201d over Cambridge Analytica. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Sandberg at one point wondered if she should be worried about her job (though that appears to no longer be the case, based on Zuckerberg's public support).\n\nGalloway said it would look bad for Facebook to fire one of the only top female executives in an industry where women \u201cface inordinately high obstacles to get to leadership positions.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Sandberg has also been a positive force on Facebook. She was hired to be the \u201cadult\u201d in the room and has filled that role well. She moves comfortably outside tech circles and in public speaking, countering Zuckerberg's shortcomings in that area.\n\nIf anything, Sandberg's departure from Facebook would likely be on her own terms. While Zuckerberg has spent all of his adult life at Facebook, Sandberg had a career before Facebook and even tech, so it is plausible that she would have a life after Facebook, perhaps back in politics.\n\nBut first, she has Facebook's own troubles to deal with. The task seems daunting because its problems might never go away.

But without real-world trials, he says they can\u2019t obtain the knowledge needed to test systems or prevent hostile attacks.\n\n\u201cBasically, you should teach basic computer knowledge, and then try to solve some hacking problems,\u201d he said, adding that the best way to improve one\u2019s computer infiltration skills is with real-time and real-world practice.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea acquires [their] knowledge by invading other systems,\u201d said Kim.\n\nHe added that because North Korea can directly attack other countries, that effort has enabled Pyongyang to quickly develop their world-renowned hacking skills.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s cyber army\n\nExperts assert there are between 6,000 and 7,500 members of North Korea\u2019s cyber army, split into a number of divisions to carry out cyberterrorism against state infrastructure, financial institutions, and the latest hijacking of defense technology.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea was inspired by the Chinese cyberwar units and learned from them,\u201d said NK Intellectuals Solidarity director Heung Kwan Kim, \u201cRecognizing their power, North Korea set up the first unit within the central government in 1993.\u201d\n\nWhile Pyongyang\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau is comprised of six divisions and overseas operations in South Korea, the United States, and Japan, it\u2019s another bureau that is responsible for the bulk of North Korea\u2019s cyber warfare.\n\n\u201cUnit 121 oversees Unit 180, Unit 91, and lab 110,\u201d Heung Kwan Kim told VOA.\n\nA 500-person strong Unit 121 was created in 1998, and in 2009 the group successfully carried out 77 attacks by overwhelming computer networks through unleashing an onslaught of Internet traffic.\n\nThis led Pyongyang to conclude that cyber-warfare was \u201cthe most suitable form of war\u201d for North Korea in the modern era, according to Heung Kwan Kim.\n\nAttacks continued throughout 2014, and in 2015. When North Korea reorganized their divisions, Unit 121 was given the mission of attacking a foreign nation\u2019s infrastructure, such as transportation networks, telecommunications, gas, electric power, nuclear power, and aviation systems.\n\nUnit 91\u2019s focus was shifted to acquiring \u201cadvanced technologies needed for nuclear development and long-range missiles from developed countries.\u201d\n\nFinally, the role of Unit 180 was changed for it to target financial systems and to focus on block chain technology.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchains\n\nWith international sanctions crippling Pyongyang\u2019s coffers, Heung Kwan Kim said North Korea shifted their cyberattacks to private systems, rather than government networks, because the smaller entities weren\u2019t as well protected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem of North Korea\u2019s high ability and low security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe numerous attacks on small and private companies have led to allegations that Pyongyang is hacking into cryptocurrency exchanges to steal virtual money, like Bitcoin, said Seungjoo Kim. Stolen cryptocurrencies are attractive because they are difficult to trace back to their original owner.\n\nIn 2017, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus was accused of attacking South Korea cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. The cyber thieves made off with nearly $7 million in digital currencies.\n\nThe hackers also obtained personal information of users stored on the compromised servers. The BBC reports North Korea was later able to ransom additional funds from the owners in exchange for deleting the data.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is easy to steal because it moves in cyberspace,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo earn cryptocurrency in a legitimate way, cutting-edge computers are required, but North Korea doesn\u2019t have them, so they attack computers abroad and hack mining programs.\u201d\n\nThe hacked computers then send any virtual coins it uncovers to North Korean digital wallets they can convert to hard currency.\n\nTo curtail North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks, he advocates a detente in the virtual world that\u2019s similar to the easing of tensions taking place on the peninsula. However, that may be difficult, as it would require Pyongyang to admit it committed acts of cyberwarfare.\n\nIn addition, it would require \u201cRussia and China not only participating in current real-world sanctions, cyber sanctions at the same time,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nThe last component, he said, would be for governments to codify what measures would be employed as proportional responses, should additional cyberattacks take place and prepare for those events."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Easter Island Natives Plead For British Museum To Return Ancient Rapa Nui Sculpture", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/easter-island-statues-return-rapa-nui_us_5bf4bdafe4b03b230f9c8a47", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The governor of Easter Island made an emotional plea to the British Museum for the return of an ancient sculpture, featuring the Rapa Nui\u2019s famed stone faces, which has been on display in London for 150 years.\n\n\u201cI believe that my children and their children also deserve the opportunity to touch, see and learn from him,\u201d Tarita Alarc\u00f3n Rapu, governor of the Chilean island, said of the sculpture, according to the Agence France-Presse.\n\n\u201cWe are just a body. You, the British people, have our soul,\u201d she added.\n\nRapu, along with a delegation of indigenous Rapanui people, met with museum officials in London this week to petition for the 8-foot sculpture, named Hoa Hakananai\u2019a, which translates to \u201clost or stolen friend.\u201d\n\nThe Hoa Hakananai\u2019a is one of nearly 1,000 monolithic statues, known indigenously as moai, created by the island\u2019s early Polynesian inhabitants between 1100 and 1600 A.D.\n\nRapanui islanders believe the moai have spiritual ties to their ancestors. According to New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, moai represent Rapa Nui\u2019s ancestral chiefs and are believed to be direct descendants from the gods.\n\nThe Hoa Hakananai\u2019a is also one of only 14 such sculptures to be made of basalt.\n\nThe delegation\u2019s meeting in London didn\u2019t result in a resolution, but British Museum officials did accept an invitation to continue talks with the indigenous group in Easter Island, according to Artnet News.\n\nChile\u2019s national assets minister, who accompanied the Rapanui delegates, told Agence France-Presse that negotiations over the moai\u2019s return could go on for a while.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of many conversations we will have,\u201d he said.\n\nEFE Featured in the British Museum, the Hoa Hakananai\u2019a's name translates to \"lost or stolen friend.\"\n\nMembers of the U.K.\u2019s Royal Navy on the H.M.S. Topaze took the Hoa Hakananai\u2019a from the island, reportedly without permission, in 1868. They gave it to Queen Victoria, who then gifted it to the British Museum.\n\n\u201cYou have kept him for 150 years, just give us some months, and we can have him,\u201d Rapu said in tears outside of the British Museum this week.\n\n\u201cWe want the museum to understand that the moai are our family, not just rocks. For us [the statue] is a brother; but for them it is a souvenir or an attraction,\u201d Anakena Manutomatoma, a member of Easter Island\u2019s development commission, told The Guardian in an article dated Nov. 16.\n\n\u201cOnce eyes are added to the statues, an energy is breathed into the moai and they become the living embodiment of ancestors whose role is to protect us,\u201d she added.\n\nmcdermp via Getty Images The ancient moai are one of the most iconic sculptures in the world.\n\nIn recent years, the Rapanui people have ramped up efforts to preserve the island\u2019s indigenous culture and gain independence from the Chilean government, which in 1888 annexed the island. Easter Island is located some 2,200 miles from the South American continent.\n\nThe campaign to return moai to the island is a part of those efforts.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in the past we did not attach so much importance to Hoa Hakananai\u2019a and his brothers, but nowadays people on the island are starting to realize just how much of our heritage there is around the world and starting to ask why our ancestors are in foreign museums,\u201d Rapanui sculptor Benedicto Tuki told BBC.\n\nTuki volunteered to create an identical moai for the museum should it decide to return the original.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it won\u2019t possess the same ancestral spirit, but it will look identical,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only wish is for him to return home; for me this is worth far more than any amount of money.

One testimony alleged that a woman was hung from the ceiling for a long period of time, and at least one activist attempted suicide multiple times while detained.

Trump has instead stressed the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, as well as the economic benefits of Saudi purchases of U.S. weapons.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance has prompted a barrage of bipartisan criticism. Sen Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), of late a staunch Trump supporter, said Tuesday \u201cit is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder\u201d of Khashoggi.\n\nSen.

They notified a destroyer that sunk it shortly before Japanese bombers arrived to strafe the harbor.\n\nBy then Chavez, who had worked through the early morning hours, had gone to his nearby home to sleep, ordering his wife not to wake him because he had been up all night.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like I only slept about 10 minutes when she called me and said, \u2018We\u2019re being attacked,\u2019\u201d he recalled in 2016. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Who is going to attack us?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018The Japanese are here, and they\u2019re attacking everything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe ran back to the harbor to find it in flames.\n\nChavez would spend the next week there, working around the clock sifting through the destruction that had crippled the U.S. Navy\u2019s Pacific fleet.\n\nLater he was assigned to the transport ship USS La Salle, ferrying troops, tanks and other equipment to war-torn islands across the Pacific, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa.\n\nAlthough never wounded, he left the military in 1945 suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder that left him anxious and shaking.\n\nReturning to San Diego, where he had grown up, he took a job as a landscaper and groundskeeper, attributing the outdoors, a healthy diet and a strict workout program that he continued into his early 100s with restoring his health.\n\n\u201cHe loved trees and he dearly loved plants and he knew everything about a plant or tree that you could possibly want to know,\u201d his daughter said Wednesday with a chuckle. \u201cAnd he finally retired when he was 95.\u201d\n\nStill, he would not talk about Pearl Harbor for decades. Then, on a last-minute whim, he decided to return to Hawaii in 1991 for ceremonies marking the attack\u2019s 50th anniversary.\n\n\u201cThen we did the 55th, the 60th, the 65th and the 70th, and from then on we went to every one,\u201d his daughter recalled, adding that until Chavez\u2019s health began to fail he had planned to attend this year\u2019s gathering next month.\n\nBorn March 12, 1912, in San Bernardino, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Chavez moved to San Diego as a child, where his family ran a wholesale flower business. He joined the Navy in 1938.\n\nIn his later years, as he became well known as the attack\u2019s oldest military survivor, he\u2019d be approached at memorial services and other events and asked for his autograph or to pose for pictures. He always maintained that those events were not about him, however, but about those who gave their lives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d just shrug his shoulders and shake his head and say, \u2018I was just doing my job,\u2019\u201d said his daughter. \u201cHe was just a very nice, quiet man. He never hollered about anything, and he was always pleasant to everybody.\u201d\n\nChavez was preceded in death by his wife, Margaret. His daughter is his only survivor.\n\nFuneral services are pending.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Trump May Move Ahead With Plans To Make Asylum Seekers Wait In Mexico: Report", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-asylum-seekers-wait-mexico_us_5bf631c0e4b03b230f9e91d9", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration is preparing to unveil a plan that would force asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico while their applications are being processed, according to a report late Wednesday in The Washington Post.\n\nThe proposal, dubbed \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d would be a dramatic change in government policy, which currently allows those seeking political asylum to remain in the United States while their applications are processed.

In his opinion, Friedman wrote that \u201cas despicable as this practice may be,\u201d FGM is a crime that should fall under the jurisdiction of states \u2015 not the federal government. He found that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it passed a federal law criminalizing FGM in 1996.\n\nBut some activists are worried about the message that the ruling will send to members of Nagarwala\u2019s religious community, Dawoodi Bohras, for whom genital cutting is still a deeply engrained tradition.\n\nMariya Tehrer is the co-founder of Sahiyo, a group that seeks to end FGM in the Bohra community. Tehrer told HuffPost that many in the Sahiyo community \u2015 particularly survivors of the practice \u2015 feel the judge\u2019s decision is \u201ca punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are sort of in shock and disbelief,\u201d Tehrer said.\n\nWatch a Love Matters India video about khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community below.\n\nThe primary concern among activists is that Bohras who support genital cutting will misinterpret the ruling as proof that the practice is permissible. But Tehrer said Friedman\u2019s ruling had to do with a jurisdictional and technical challenge, pointing out that in his opinion, the judge called the practice of genital cutting \u201cessentially a criminal assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication is that he views this as a criminal activity, but a local criminal activity under state jurisdiction,\u201d Tehrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important distinction, but the reality is that many people have been using it as proof that we can continue this. That\u2019s not at all what happened.\u201d\n\nThe government is reviewing Friedman\u2019s opinion, The Associated Press reports. Experts are expecting it to be appealed.\n\nThe Nagarwala case is believed to be the first brought under the federal law against FGM, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. Only 27 states currently have laws criminalizing FGM.\n\nNagarwala, a former emergency room physician, was arrested in April 2017, after an FBI investigation uncovered that she allegedly removed clitoral skin from two 7-year-old girls. Prosecutors claimed the girls were brought from Minnesota to Livonia for the procedure.\n\nThe investigation eventually uncovered nine alleged victims of FGM.\n\nMichigan\u2019s law against FGM passed after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest and can\u2019t be used to retroactively charge the doctor or others involved in the case, the Detroit Free Press reports.\n\nShannon Smith, Nagarwala\u2019s lawyer, has maintained that the procedure the doctor performed does not qualify as FGM.\n\n\u201cDr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\u201d Smith told the Detroit Free Press after the ruling. \u201cThe whole community was shocked when this happened. She\u2019s always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is primarily a cultural tradition that is practiced by some members of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other faiths, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nMost American Muslim denominations do not practice FGM. In fact, prominent Muslim organizations have openly condemned the practice. But for years, Dawoodi Bohras, a Mumbai-based sect of Shia Islam, have practiced a type of genital cutting called khatna, or khafz. Bohras have long considered khatna to be a religious requirement for women, even though it is rarely discussed by mosque leaders. The social pressure to have daughters undergo the procedure has been quietly passed down from woman to woman over generations.\n\nSupporters of khatna resist having their practice defined as FGM. But Tahrer said although the kind of genital cutting typically practiced by Bohras is not as extreme as other forms, it is still happening to young girls who are not able to give their consent.\n\nIn addition, calling khatna simply a \u201cnick\u201d or a \u201cwiping\u201d of the clitoral hood also dismisses the stories of many survivors who say they are still experiencing physical or emotional harm from the procedure, Tahrer said.\n\nThe WHO and The United Nations Population Fund consider genital cutting to be a human rights violation \u2015 no matter the severity of the particular procedure.\n\nCourtesy of Sahiyo Sahiyo cofounders in Mumbai India displaying an award the organization received for their work on female genital cutting.\n\nBoth Bohra men and women have spoken up against khatna in recent years. At the same time, since Nagarwala\u2019s arrest, some Dawoodi Bohra women have banded together to publicly defend the practice as harmless, and claim that governmental attempts to restrict it infringes on their religious freedom. Tahrer said she\u2019s noticed a movement to dismiss survivors\u2019 stories as attention-seeking attempts to \u201cbadmouth\u201d the community. And the sect\u2019s religious leaders in Mumbai still largely support khatna, Tahrer said, which makes it harder for local imams in India and the diaspora to publicly speak against it.\n\nStill, Tahrer believes the discussions the Nagarwala case have prompted within the Bohra community are a positive development."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "'Real World: New Orleans' Star Danny Roberts Reveals He's HIV-Positive", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/real-world-danny-roberts-hiv-positive_us_5bf59e4ee4b03b230f9e1a3b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "J.

Instead, their symptoms were similar to those that had previously been associated with hysterical women \u2013 most commonly amnesia, or some kind of paralysis or inability to communicate with no clear physical cause.\n\nEnglish physician Charles Myers, who wrote the first paper on \u201cshell-shock\u201d in 1915, theorized that these symptoms actually did stem from a physical injury. He posited that repetitive exposure to concussive blasts caused brain trauma that resulted in this strange grouping of symptoms. But once put to the test, his hypothesis didn\u2019t hold up. There were plenty of veterans who had not been exposed to the concussive blasts of trench warfare, for example, who were still experiencing the symptoms of shell-shock. (And certainly not all veterans who had seen this kind of battle returned with symptoms.)\n\nWe now know that what these combat veterans were facing was likely what today we call post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. We are now better able to recognize it, and treatments have certainly advanced, but we still don\u2019t have a full understanding of just what PTSD is.\n\nThe medical community and society at large are accustomed to looking for the most simple cause and cure for any given ailment. This results in a system where symptoms are discovered and cataloged and then matched with therapies that will alleviate them. Though this method works in many cases, for the past 100 years, PTSD has been resisting.\n\nWe are three scholars in the humanities who have individually studied PTSD \u2013 the framework through which people conceptualize it, the ways researchers investigate it, the therapies the medical community devises for it. Through our research, each of us has seen how the medical model alone fails to adequately account for the ever-changing nature of PTSD.\n\nWhat\u2019s been missing is a cohesive explanation of trauma that allows us to explain the various ways its symptoms have manifested over time and can differ in different people.\n\nNonphysical repercussions of the Great War\n\nOnce it became clear that not everyone who suffered from shell-shock in the wake of WWI had experienced brain injuries, the British Medical Journal provided alternate nonphysical explanations for its prevalence.\n\nA poor morale and a defective training are one of the most important, if not the most important etiological factors: also that shell-shock was a \u201ccatching\u201d complaint. \u2013 (The British Medical Journal, 1922)\n\nShell-shock went from being considered a legitimate physical injury to being a sign of weakness, of both the battalion and the soldiers within it. One historian estimates at least 20 percent of men developed shell-shock, though the figures are murky due to physician reluctance at the time to brand veterans with a psychological diagnosis that could affect disability compensation.\n\nSoldiers were archetypically heroic and strong. When they came home unable to speak, walk or remember, with no physical reason for those shortcomings, the only possible explanation was personal weakness. Treatment methods were based on the idea that the soldier who had entered into war as a hero was now behaving as a coward and needed to be snapped out of it.\n\nLewis Yealland, a British clinician, described in his 1918 \u201cHysterical Disorders of Warfare\u201d the kind of brutal treatment that follows from thinking about shell-shock as a personal failure. After nine months of unsuccessfully treating patient A1, including electric shocks to the neck, cigarettes put out on his tongue and hot plates placed at the back of his throat, Yealland boasted of telling the patient, \u201cYou will not leave this room until you are talking as well as you ever did; no, not before\u2026 you must behave as the hero I expect you to be.\u201d\n\nYealland then applied an electric shock to the throat so strong that it sent the patient reeling backwards, unhooking the battery from the machine. Undeterred, Yealland strapped the patient down to avoid the battery problem and continued to apply shock for an hour, at which point patient A1 finally whispered \u201cAh.\u201d After another hour, the patient began to cry and whispered, \u201cI want a drink of water.\u201d\n\nYealland reported this encounter triumphantly \u2013 the breakthrough meant his theory was correct and his method worked. Shell-shock was a disease of manhood rather than an illness that came from witnessing, being subjected to and partaking in incredible violence.\n\nEvolution away from shell-shock\n\nThe next wave of the study of trauma came when the Second World War saw another influx of soldiers dealing with similar symptoms.\n\nIt was Abram Kardiner, a clinician working in the psychiatric clinic of the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau, who rethought combat trauma in a much more empathetic light. In his influential book, \u201cThe Traumatic Neuroses of War,\u201d Kardiner speculated that these symptoms stemmed from psychological injury, rather than a soldier\u2019s flawed character.\n\nWork from other clinicians after WWII and the Korean War suggested that post-war symptoms could be lasting. Longitudinal studies showed that symptoms could persist anywhere from six to 20 years, if they disappeared at all. These studies returned some legitimacy to the concept of combat trauma that had been stripped away after the First World War.\n\nAs veterans returned home from the war in Vietnam, combat trauma became less stigmatized. manhhai, CC BY\n\nVietnam was another watershed moment for combat-related PTSD because veterans began to advocate for themselves in an unprecedented way. Beginning with a small march in New York in the summer of 1967, veterans themselves began to become activists for their own mental health care. They worked to redefine \u201cpost-Vietnam syndrome\u201d not as a sign of weakness, but rather a normal response to the experience of atrocity. Public understanding of war itself had begun to shift, too, as the widely televised accounts of the My Lai massacre brought the horror of war into American living rooms for the first time. The veterans\u2019 campaign helped get PTSD included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-III), the major American diagnostic resource for psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians.\n\nThe authors of the DSM-III deliberately avoided talking about the causes of mental disorders. Their aim was to develop a manual that could simultaneously be used by psychiatrists adhering to radically different theories, including Freudian approaches and what is now known as \u201cbiological psychiatry.\u201d These groups of psychiatrists would not agree on how to explain disorders, but they could \u2013 and did \u2013 come to agree on which patients had similar symptoms. So the DSM-III defined disorders, including PTSD, solely on the basis of clusters of symptoms, an approach that has been retained ever since.\n\nThis tendency to agnosticism about the physiology of PTSD is also reflected in contemporary evidence-based approaches to medicine. Modern medicine focuses on using clinical trials to demonstrate that a therapy works, but is skeptical about attempts to link treatment effectiveness to the biology underlying a disease.\n\nToday\u2019s medicalized PTSD\n\nPeople can develop PTSD for a number of different reasons, not just in combat. Sexual assault, a traumatic loss, a terrible accident \u2013 each might lead to PTSD. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates about 13.8 percent of the veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan currently have PTSD. For comparison, a male veteran of those wars is four times more likely to develop PTSD than a man in the civilian population is. PTSD is probably at least partially at the root of an even more alarming statistic: Upwards of 22 veterans commit suicide every day.\n\nTherapies for PTSD today tend to be a mixed bag. Practically speaking, when veterans seek PTSD treatment in the VA system, policy requires they be offered either exposure or cognitive therapy. Exposure therapies are based on the idea that the fear response that gives rise to many of the traumatic symptoms can be dampened through repeated exposures to the traumatic event. Cognitive therapies work on developing personal coping methods and slowly changing unhelpful or destructive thought patterns that are contributing to symptoms (for example, the shame one might feel at not successfully completing a mission or saving a comrade). The most common treatment a veteran will likely receive will include psychopharmaceuticals \u2013 especially the class of drugs called SSRIs.\n\nMindfulness therapies, based on becoming aware of mental states, thoughts and feelings and accepting them rather than trying to fight them or push them away, are another option. There are also more alternative methods being studied such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or EMDR therapy, therapies using controlled doses of MDMA (Ecstasy), virtual reality-graded exposure therapy, hypnosis and creative therapies. The military funds a wealth of research on new technologies to address PTSD; these include neurotechnological innovations like transcranial stimulation and neural chips as well as novel drugs.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that patients improve most when they\u2019ve chosen their own therapy. But even if they narrow their choices to the ones backed by the weight of the National Center for PTSD by using the center\u2019s online Treatment Decision Aid, patients would still find themselves weighing five options, each of which is evidence-based but entails a different psychomedical model of trauma and healing.\n\nThis buffet of treatment options lets us set aside our lack of understanding of why people experience trauma and respond to interventions so differently. It also relieves the pressure for psychomedicine to develop a complete model of PTSD. We reframe the problem as a consumer issue instead of a scientific one.\n\nThus, while WWI was about soldiers and punishing them for their weakness, in the contemporary era, the ideal veteran PTSD patient is a health care consumer who has an obligation to play an active role in figuring out and optimizing his own therapy.\n\nAs we stand here with the strange benefit of the hindsight that comes with 100 years of studying combat-related trauma, we must be careful in celebrating our progress. What is still missing is an explanation of why people have different responses to trauma, and why different responses occur in different historical periods. For instance, the paralysis and amnesia that epitomized WWI shell-shock cases are now so rare that they don\u2019t even appear as symptoms in the DSM entry for PTSD. We still don\u2019t know enough about how soldiers\u2019 own experiences and understandings of PTSD are shaped by the broader social and cultural views of trauma, war and gender. Though we have made incredible strides in the century since World War I, PTSD remains a chameleon, and demands our continued study."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "6 Surprising Things That Can Contribute To Nightmares", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/things-that-can-contribute-to-nightmares_us_5bf57476e4b03b230f9d8ba7", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Image Source via Getty Images There are numerous factors that can contribute to disrupted sleep and bad dreams, according to experts.\n\nEveryone knows what it\u2019s like to be jolted awake by a particularly scary dream. While it\u2019s easy to blame it on your last viewing of \u201cThe Shining\u201d or some other terrifying film, the true culprits of our nightmares are the seemingly mundane activities we do every day.\n\nNightmares are different from regular not-so-great dreams because they wake us up suddenly, often during the early hours when we\u2019re well into our rapid eye movement sleep. Nightmares are also not to be confused with night terrors, which typically happen soon after we fall asleep, and which feel very real \u2015 so waking up feels even more terrifying.\n\nNightmares are more common among children than adults, but that doesn\u2019t mean adults don\u2019t experience them. An estimated 50 percent of adults have occasional nightmares, according to psychology experts. Women have them more frequently than men.\n\n\u201cIn general, nightmares aren\u2019t a threat to sleep quality or health,\u201d said Ginger Houghton, a licensed clinical social worker and owner of Bright Spot Counseling in Michigan. \u201cHowever, if the nightmares are consistent and severe enough that a person struggles at work, home or school or if they want to avoid sleep, it\u2019s time to find a board-certified sleep medicine doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the nightmares are consistent and severe enough that a person struggles at work, home or school or if they want to avoid sleep, it\u2019s time to find a board-certified sleep medicine doctor.\u201d - Ginger Houghton, licensed clinical social worker\n\nChances are good this doesn\u2019t describe you: Only about 1 percent of adults have nightmares frequent enough that they need to seek professional help. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should just brush off your bad dream. Dina Merhbi, a registered dietitian in Montreal and founder of the Body Balance Method, said that even one nightmare can increase your fatigue, which may lead to unhealthy habits the next day.\n\n\u201cSleep is a time for the body to relax and reboot for the next day,\u201d Merhbi said. \u201cHowever, nightmares cause a high anxiety state that actually prevents the body from relaxing, and will cause changes in the next day like increased fatigue, heightened senses, [and] increased caffeine and sugar intake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long term,\u201d she said, \u201cwith recurrent nightmares, this will impact the energy and mental health of the person and might become a catalyst for depression, anxiety and even health issues such as glucose intolerance and high blood pressure.\u201d\n\nAnd while the link is not fully understood, experts have found a connection between frequent nightmares and mental health problems. Studies have found that people experiencing regular nightmares are at a higher risk of self-harm and suicide.\n\nSo how do you get control over your nightmares? One way is to look at what could be contributing to them. Below are a few things that could be adding to the problem, according to experts:\n\nYou\u2019re dealing with mental health problems.\n\nLuis Alvarez via Getty Images\n\nAccording to John Mayer, a clinical psychologist practicing in Chicago, negative thinking and unresolved issues play a huge role in determining what kind of nightmares, and how many of them, you might have.\n\n\u201cOur brains work like a computer; what goes in equals what comes out,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cSo, if you go to bed with negative thoughts or you\u2019re replaying negatives from your day, boom! Your brain is going to be loaded with negative thoughts to recycle while you sleep.\u201d\n\nOne Finnish study found that people who have severe depression or even just a negative self-attitude were likely to have more nightmares. In fact, 28 percent of their participants who had severe depression also reported having frequent nightmares.\n\nWhile depression is definitely a factor, general stress from everyday life can also have a significant impact on bad dreams and sleep quality. Common circumstances, such as moving, having an upcoming test or changing roles at work, can trigger a nightmare. Grief and other serious issues can also increase your risk.\n\n\u201cStress, unresolved conflicts and personal tragedies all contribute toward generating nightmares,\u201d said Damian Sendler, a clinician who specializes in treating patients with psychological and psychiatric conditions in New York. \u201cNightmares are \u2014 in a way \u2014 the pimples of our imagination. Just as with pimples that show up after there is an excessive accumulation of dirt and bacteria in the skin, nightmares are the byproduct of the mind corrupted by troubles and worries.\u201d\n\nYou have certain personality traits.\n\nSome research has indicated that character traits may contribute to bad dreams. A 2001 study looked at people who were experiencing around two nightmares a month and found that those who are more sensitive are more likely to have frequent bad dreams. Another study discovered that people with artistic and creative interests are also more likely to experience nightmares on a regular basis.\n\nAustrian-American psychoanalyst and sleep researcher Ernest Hartmann found that people with thinner personality boundaries \u2014 those who are open-minded, sensitive and creative \u2014 are more likely to have longer, vivid, detailed and emotional dreams. And that dream content usually \u201cshowed a trend towards correlation with aggressive interaction and nightmare-likeness.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re processing a trauma.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, nightmares are a major symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. This can make it difficult to fall asleep again, which can in turn make the whole next day more challenging.\n\n\u201cSome people wake with a sad or scared feeling after nightmares, which can be a difficult start to the day,\u201d said Alex Dimitriu, a physician and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine. \u201cIf this occurs rarely, it is quite normal. However, regular frequent nightmares can be a sign of either some repressed memory, trauma, or possibly sleep apnea or sleep disturbance.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople with PTSD are most commonly known to experience recurring nightmares, often around the traumatic event,\u201d Dimitriu said. \u201cIn these instances, we always advise seeking professional help.\u201d\n\nYou ate before bed.\n\nAJ_Watt via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s pretty well understood that late-night snacking isn\u2019t the best thing for your health, but you might not realize it could be the source of your nightmares. Eating a big meal, or even just a snack, increases your metabolism and body temperature. This causes your brain to be more active, and thus could lead to more nightmares.\n\nA 2015 study by the University of Montreal found that 9.5 percent of people had bad dreams after indulging in a late-night meal. Another 2015 study surveyed almost 400 students and had them keep a record of their dreams, and of what they ate, for two weeks. About 44 percent of people reported that ice cream and other dairy products caused bizarre and disturbing dreams. And there\u2019s even some evidence to suggest spicy foods can lead to nightmares.\n\nYou had a nightcap.\n\nWhile drinking alcohol might initially help you fall asleep, your night is going to be anything but restful. At some point, the alcohol metabolizes and the sedative effect wears off, creating fragmented sleep and nightmares, according to the Cleveland Clinic. And thanks to that vodka tonic, your dreams and nightmares will be way more vivid than usual. There\u2019s even a chance you\u2019ll \u201cact out\u201d your dreams or sleepwalk.\n\nYour medication is messing with your sleep.\n\nCertain drugs may also affect nightmares. According to the Mayo Clinic, blood pressure medications, antidepressants, antihistamines (found in sleep aids and allergy medicines) and steroids are some of the typical offenders. Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and cholesterol-lowering medications can also contribute to disturbed sleep and bad dreams.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the 1 to 5 percent of people who take these medications and have nightmares \u2015 and it\u2019s affecting your quality of life \u2015 check in with your doctor.\n\nHow can you prevent nightmares?\n\nAdene Sanchez via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to treating any mental health issues, watching your eating habits before bed and talking to your doctor about medication intake, there are a few things you can do to make sure you get a good nightmare-free sleep. Healthy lifestyle habits like meditation, therapy, exercise and journaling can help improve sleep, which in turn may help with your nightmares.\n\nAlex Tran, a wellness expert and yoga teacher in California, said that meditation helped her clear negative thought patterns from her abusive childhood that she believed were contributing to her frequent nightmares.\n\n\u201cI grew up having nightmares two to three times a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI found yoga in my early 20s, and the physical practice introduced me to the meditative practice. This has allowed me to clear my thoughts while drifting into sleep, get rid of my nightmares and enjoy a peaceful sleep.\u201d\n\nBecause nightmares can sometimes be a sign of an unresolved issue or conflict in your life, Dara Bushman, a licensed clinical psychologist practicing in South Florida, said acknowledging the problem before you fall asleep could also help with prevention.\n\n\u201cFrequent nightmares are often the result of the mind processing a prior event,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mind does not respond to \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 think of something. In fact, when you drive by a car accident, and someone tells you not to look, the first thing someone does is look. You can prevent nightmares by thinking of the uncomfortable stimulus.\u201d\n\nDream expert and author Lauri Loewenberg suggests that nightmares are not something to be feared. Rather, they\u2019re a tool to help you manage and assess your overall well-being.\n\n\u201cThe occasional nightmare may keep you from being able to fall back asleep and have you a bit upset the following day but is typically not harmful,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it can be very good for you because it is the subconscious alerting you to something that is wrong in your life [like] a difficult, ignored or mishandled issue that needs attention and correction.\u201d\n\nSo next time you find yourself jolted awake after being chased by a monster in your sleep, ask yourself what that monster might represent. It could be the first step to put it \u2014 and the rest of your nightmares \u2014 away for good."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Admits To Targeting Billionaire George Soros In PR Attack", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-target-george-soros-billionaire_us_5bf5d6f2e4b0771fb6b5b1ec", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook officials on Wednesday admitted to digging up dirt on Jewish billionaire George Soros and its competitors less than a week after The New York Times published an explosive expos\u00e9 on the tech giant.\n\nElliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s head of communication and policy, published a blog post detailing the company\u2019s decision to hire Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, and why it aimed its effort at the company\u2019s critics, including Soros.\n\n\u201cSome of this work is being characterized as opposition research,\u201d Schrage wrote. \u201cBut I believe it would be irresponsible and unprofessional for us not to understand the backgrounds and potential conflicts of interest of our critics.\u201d\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied having any knowledge of the company\u2019s PR campaign against Soros until the Times investigation, which also found negative campaigns aimed at Apple and Google, was made public.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, also denied having knowledge of the hiring of Definers.

In September, they submitted a first draft to the State Board of Education, which comprises five Democrats and 10 Republicans.\n\nAfter the board approved the draft to open it up for public comment, it quickly made national headlines because Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and Ms. Keller\u2019s names had been removed. Comments poured in, and not all of them from within state lines.\n\nMarty Rowley, a Republican member of the education board, said he had not immediately noticed the deleted names when he voted to make the document public in September. Two months later, he approved the version that had restored Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and Ms. Keller\u2019s names."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "title": "Girl, 13, Who Wrote Essay on Gun Violence Is Killed by Stray Bullet", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/us/sandra-parks-milwaukee-gunfire.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "When she was in sixth grade, Sandra Parks wrote an award-winning essay about gun violence and crime in her hometown, Milwaukee.\n\nThis week, two years after she described how \u201cwe are in a state of chaos,\u201d she was fatally shot when someone outside fired a gun at her home and a stray bullet went into her bedroom.\n\nThe shooting happened Monday as Sandra, 13, was watching television at the time, her sister, Tatiana Ingram, told the television station WISN.\n\n\u201cMy sister took it like a soldier: She just walked in the room and said, \u2018Mama, I\u2019m shot,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ingram said. \u201cShe was only hit one time, in her chest.
