The agency also is reviewing other custody options to relieve capacity issues in the El Paso, Texas, sector, such as working with nongovernmental organizations or local partners for temporary housing.\n\n\u2022 Nielsen said she has asked that Centers for Disease Control experts investigate the increase in sick migrant children in order to identify steps hospitals along the border can take to treat them.\n\n\u2022 The US Coast Guard Medical Corps has been asked to assess CBP's medical programs and recommend improvements. The Defense Department has been asked to provide additional medical professionals.\n\n\u2022 Finally, CBP is reviewing its policies, with a focus on the care and custody of children under 10 -- both at intake and beyond 24 hours in custody, the agency said.\n\nWhat happened to the 8-year-old boy\n\nCBP released a timeline of the days before the boy's death . On Monday, the boy was taken to a hospital, diagnosed with a cold, released with medication, then taken back to the hospital before dying about 12 minutes before Christmas.\n\nThe cause of the boy's death is not clear.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Fifty-seven years later, Gabriel Bach still pauses to compose himself when he tells the story of the girl in the red coat. Bach took time to speak with me last week about his experience as one of three Israeli prosecutors who tried the notorious Nazi logistics director Adolf Eichmann for war crimes in Jerusalem in 1961.\n\nBach, now 91, still remembers the testimony of one particular Holocaust survivor. Responding to Bach's questioning, the survivor, Dr. Martin Foldi, described how he was transported in a cattle car from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944 with his wife, son and daughter. Upon arrival, two lines formed. A Nazi guard signaled for Foldi to go right and Foldi's wife, son and daughter to go left.\n\nFoldi had recently bought a red coat for his daughter, who was 2\u00bd years old. When Foldi looked up a few moments after being separated from his family, he could no longer see his wife or son in the distance. But, Bach recalls, Foldi testified he could see \"that little red dot getting smaller and smaller -- this is how my family disappeared from my life.\"\n\nLike any good prosecutor, Bach tried to maintain an unflappable demeanor. However, even in a trial recounting countless colossal horrors, Bach said the testimony about the red coat was the \"only minute of the trial ... I suddenly couldn't utter a sound.\" Aware that the judges were waiting for him to continue and that television cameras were rolling, Bach pretended to shuffle papers on his desk to allow himself a moment to recover.\n\nBach's life story is particularly relevant today given the rising tide of ethnic and racial intolerance -- and extremist attacks borne of such hatred -- in the United States and across the globe. More than five decades ago, as the whole world watched, Bach faced down Eichmann, an infamous Nazi officer who perpetrated genocide on a nearly unthinkable scale, in a courtroom in Israel. The lessons from the Eichmann trial -- about the rule of law, the quest for justice and the dangers posed by ethnic hatred -- still resonate today.\n\nEichmann was known as the \" architect \" of the Holocaust because he was responsible for identifying, gathering and transporting millions of Jews and others to concentration camps across Europe. Bach refers to Eichmann as the \"director of the Holocaust\" because of his central role in planning and carrying out the execution of millions of innocents.\n\nProsecuting the architect of the Holocaust\n\nAmerican forces captured Eichmann at the end of World War II, but he escaped from a prison camp in 1946. He remained in hiding while an international manhunt ensued. Fourteen years after Eichmann's escape, Israeli intelligence agents captured him in Argentina in 1960 (as depicted in several books and movies, including 2018's \" Operation Finale \") and then transported him to Jerusalem for trial.\n\nThe trial began in April 1961. Bach led the prosecution team's investigation, gathering witnesses, documents, film and other evidence from around the globe. He presented testimony from numerous witnesses, including survivors with remarkable stories; one had been a young child who was let out of a locked gas chamber just before execution to help unload a delivery of potatoes that had arrived at the camp. Bach felt it was important that the court hear from at least one survivor from every Nazi-occupied country.\n\nAdolf Eichmann, the Holocaust's \"architect,\" goes on trial in Jerusalem in 1961 after Israel captured him.\n\nOver four months, the world watched as Bach and his colleagues methodically laid out the proof of Eichmann's crimes. During the trial, Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass box. Bach sat just feet away at counsel's table. Bach recalls that, throughout the trial, Eichmann was stoic and unemotional.\n\nEichmann and his court-appointed attorney maintained during the trial that he merely followed orders from his Nazi superiors. Hannah Arendt, who covered the trial for The New Yorker, later contended in her controversial book \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" that Eichmann embodied the \"banality of evil.\" Arendt wrote, \"Eichmann was not Iago and not Macbeth. ... Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement, he had no motives at all. ... He merely, to put the matter colloquially, never realized what he was doing.\"\n\nBach responds to Arendt's conclusion first with visceral disgust -- he calls her view \"rubbish\" -- and then with the methodical precision of a skilled prosecutor. Bach notes that Eichmann declared after the Holocaust (but before the 1961 trial) that he regretted not having done more to kill Jews. Bach then reels off examples where Eichmann took pains to prevent any person from being spared or shown mercy.\n\nIn one instance, a German general requested that a French Jewish man who was an expert in radar technology be spared so his knowledge could be utilized; Eichmann rejected the request and ordered the man deported to a concentration camp. Bach also notes that Eichmann believed it was imperative to kill children, to prevent the maturation of future generations of Jews. Arendt can have her theorizing; Bach is secure resting on the hard facts.\n\nEichmann stands in a protective glass booth flanked by Israeli police during his 1961 war crimes trial.\n\nAt the end of the trial, a three-judge panel convicted Eichmann of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other offenses, and sentenced him to death. Eichmann appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, where Bach successfully defended the verdict and sentence. Eichmann was executed by hanging on June 1, 1962. Bach was offered the opportunity to witness the execution but declined.\n\nBach does not seek to cast himself in an angelic glow, candidly acknowledging that \"I was so much full of hatred for this man (Eichmann).\" Bach takes pride, however, that despite the intense emotion surrounding the case, Eichmann was tried in accordance with established rule of law and principles of fairness. Bach, who tried many cases as prosecutor and defense attorney before the Eichmann trial, notes that \"we wanted to handle this case like we handled any other case.\"\n\nIndeed, Eichmann, the most notorious of all criminals, was afforded the same rights as other defendants in Israel at the time (which also are familiar to the American criminal justice system): the right to competent defense counsel, paid for by the state; the right to see the evidence against him in advance; the right to evidence that might be helpful to the defense; the right to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses and to call his own witnesses; and the right to appeal. Bach understood that \"it was important for history's sake that every point of legal decency had to be followed.\"\n\n'Always sort of just one step ahead'\n\nAt 91, Bach sees that he has lived an almost impossibly charmed life. Bach grew up in Berlin, where he attended the 1936 Olympics and sat so close to Adolf Hitler that he says he saw Hitler leave his private box in anger after Jesse Owens sprinted to a gold medal. Bach's Jewish family fled from Germany for the Netherlands just weeks before Kristallnacht -- when the rising Nazi party destroyed Jewish homes and properties and killed dozens of German Jews -- in November 1938.\n\nHis family then left the Netherlands one month before the Nazis invaded in 1940 and moved to the territory that would later become Israel. Bach was bar mitzvahed while in transit, on board the ship Patria -- which, on its next journey, was sunk by a bomb placed on board by Zionists -- claiming the lives of more than 250 people. Bach reflects that he and his family were \"always sort of just one step ahead.\"\n\nBach holds a photo as he tours the 2011 exhibit \"Facing Justice -- Adolf Eichmann on Trial\" in Berlin.\n\nAfter the Eichmann trial, Bach went on to a distinguished legal career, including 15 years as a justice on the Israeli Supreme Court. He now lives a quiet, happy life with his wife in Jerusalem. They have three grown children (one of whom has passed) and eight grandchildren. In his advanced age, Bach still has a sparkle in his eye, an easy laugh and a natural warmth. He has a steel trap memory for the details of the Eichmann trial and a deep faith in and respect for the rule of law.\n\nBach has spoken about his life and the Eichmann trial countless times on five continents, in countries as disparate as Brazil, Japan, South Africa and the Philippines. He has spoken many times in Germany, including in Berlin at the Parliament, where he was moved by the warm reception he received. In Israel, he is a national hero and was greeted at a recent speaking appearance with a thunderous standing ovation from a sellout crowd.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Nor can he fathom why so many people know little or nothing about the Holocaust or doubt that it ever happened.\n\nHe does, however, hold out hope that the Eichmann trial will stand through history as an unambiguous condemnation of ethnic hatred and violence. \"The fact that this terrible thing happened should never be forgotten,\" Bach says. \"And everything should be done to teach young people and older people to prevent something like that from happening in the future. That is my hope.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "What's worrying investors going into 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/zSHxFHj-iT4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) Wall Street, markets and business crave certainty. For the past month, they have been contending with confusion and disorder.\n\nUncertainty abounds at the end of a volatile year: Investors question the Federal Reserve's plans for 2019, and President Donald Trump asked aides if he could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Congress entered a budget stalemate with the president, partially shutting down the government. Trade policy that for years tried to stitch economies together is in retreat. Economists warn that the pace of US economic growth will slow next year.\n\nTo cap that off, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin issued a bizarre statement Sunday , saying he called top bank executives to assess their liquidity. He asked if they had the ability to continue lending to consumers and businesses \u2014 at a time when confidence in banks had been high.\n\nThat set already jittery investors on edge. Stocks followed their worst week since the Great Recession by plummeting yet again Monday . The last time the market fell this much in December was in 1931 , during the Great Depression.\n\nInvestors are now worried about five big items going into 2019.\n\n1. Mnuchin may know something we don't. Or not\n\nBear markets happen. Several stock indexes are down 20% from their highs, yet US markets' descent has happened relatively gradually \u2014 until recent weeks.\n\nMnuchin used crisis language when he said banks have \"ample liquidity\" and \"markets continue to function properly.\" No outward signs pointed to a crisis, contagion or liquidity concern in the financial system. Suggesting as much jolted the stock market.\n\nTrump has complained that Mnuchin hasn't done enough to stabilize markets, according to a person familiar with the matter. The statement left observers wondering: Was Mnuchin trying to placate Trump, or does he know something the markets don't know?\n\n2. The mix of higher rates and slowing economy growth\n\nBusinesses and investors were already on high alert because rates are going up as economic growth is slowing. They have good reason to worry that Powell's Fed may be too aggressive on its rate increases. The Fed lowered its growth estimate for the US economy last week, and it is notoriously horrendous at predicting recessions.\n\nIf it raises rates too quickly, the Fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession. Inflation is not currently a problem, so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate-raising pace if it wants.\n\nThe Fed signaled it would raise rates only twice next year after raising them four times in 2018. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams sought to reassure investors Friday that the Fed will remain flexible about its rate-raising and balance sheet policy if the markets take a turn for the worse. But investors weren't buying it: The Dow fell more than 400 points Friday.\n\n3. Trouble at the Fed\n\nThe Fed is only doing its job : It is expected to independently assess the state of business and the economy and determine the best course of action for monetary policy. Yet Trump threatens to undermine a Fed chair that he appointed his own appointed Fed chair by publicly criticizing him and privately asking if he can fire him.\n\nInvestors may not like the uncertainty that higher rates could bring \u2014 but firing the Fed chair 10 months into his term would be a different can of worms entirely.\n\nFor months, Trump has been lashing out at Powell, the nominee Trump considers the worst of his presidency. Trump believes Powell is to blame for this year's market turmoil, but few thought Trump would actually fire him, which could create chaos in the markets. Yet CNN and other media reported that Trump has begun polling advisers about whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.\n\nMnuchin tried to calm markets Saturday by tweeting that Trump never suggested that he would fire Powell \u2014 and Trump doesn't believe he has the right to oust the Fed chair. But Trump's ouster of Defense Secretary James Mattis months ahead of his planned resignation date concerned investors that Trump may not be listening to his advisers.\n\nits their \"touch.\" On Monday morning, Trump again attacked the Fed , likening it to a golfer who has losttheir \"touch.\"\n\n4. Shutdown showdown\n\nThe government shutdown probably won't mean much for the economy in the near term, but Washington's dysfunction isn't a great sign.\n\nFar more meaningful than a shutdown is Congress' duty to lift the debt ceiling later next year.\n\nAfter starting to recover after the Great Recession, federal deficits are rising again \u2014 and that means Treasury will have to borrow more to make up the gap between what the government spends and brings in. Lawmakers must pass a law next year so Treasury can continue to borrow without any restrictions.

We're no longer the suckers, folks. And people aren't looking at us as suckers.\"\n\nRegardless of whether Trump likes the wars or not, they are now his; the lives of the young men and women stationed abroad subject to his decisions, whims and orders. And as such, the commander in chief was fulfilling what is viewed as an essential duty in paying them a surprise Christmastime visit.\n\nAfter a secret overnight flight from Washington, the President and Melania Trump touched down onto a pitch-black airstrip, the dicey security situation still restricting Trump to a clandestine visit more than 15 years after the American invasion.\n\nHe remained on the ground for about three hours, greeting enthusiastic selfie-taking servicemen and women in their holiday-bedecked dining hall. Dressed in a black overcoat and red tie, Trump posed for pictures and signed autographs for troops in fatigues. Melania Trump stood smiling next to him, wearing a mustard-colored blouse.\n\nLater, the President changed into a green flight jacket to address 100 or so troops, who greeted him warmly.\n\nTrump left behind a slate of troubles in Washington, including a partial government shutdown and an unsteady economy. He's also faced criticism for a series of foreign policy decisions that have left his national security team at odds.\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from the foreign entanglements he describes as foolhardy mistakes made by his predecessors, including the war in Iraq. He recently ordered the US military to being planning a drawdown of troops in Afghanistan and, citing the destruction of ISIS, a complete withdrawal of 2,000 troops from Syria -- which came against the advice of his military generals and top national security officials.\n\nDuring a roundtable briefing Wednesday with military and civilian officials inside a tent at the air base in Iraq, Trump defended his decision.\n\nMembers of the military cheer as President Donald Trump speaks at a hanger rally at Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, Wednesday, Dec. 26, 2018.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\n\"They said again, recently, 'Can we have more time?' \" the President recalled. \"I said, 'Nope. You can't have any more time. You've had enough time.' We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are going to come around to my way of thinking,\" Trump predicted.\n\nHe hasn't stated plans for the 5,000 or so American troops in Iraq who returned to the country in 2014 to battle ISIS. The President was originally scheduled to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi during his stop, but the encounter was canceled.\n\n\"There was supposed to be a formal reception and a meeting between Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and the US President, but a variation of views to organize the meeting led it to be replaced by a telephone conversation,\" a statement from the prime minister's office read.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said later on Air Force One that the meeting didn't take place because of security and logistical reasons. She said that for security reasons, the White House was able to invite the prime minister only two hours before the scheduled time of the meeting and the Iraqi leader was in a different part of the country and unable to attend.\n\nSanders also told reporters that the President spoke on the phone with the Iraqi prime minister while Trump was at the base in Iraq. During the call, Trump invited Abdul-Mahdi to visit the White House and the prime minister accepted. Sanders also said Trump and senior military leaders discussed plan for countering ISIS during a briefing at the airbase.\n\nTrump said Wednesday he had no plans to pull troops from Iraq, suggesting the country could be used as a base for potential future missions in Syria.\n\nBut he reiterated that the era of heavy US intervention abroad was ending.\n\n\"The United States cannot continue to be the policeman of the world,\" Trump said. \"We are spread out all over the world. We are in countries most people haven't even heard about. Frankly, it's ridiculous.\"\n\nGeorge W. Bush made four trips to Iraq after ordering American troops into the country in 2003, including a stop on Thanksgiving to help serve turkey. Barack Obama visited once. Both men also traveled multiple times to Afghanistan.\n\nTrump's visit comes at a fraught moment for the President and the military. Trump's defense secretary resigned last week after the Syria troop decision, writing in a departure letter the President deserved a military chief more aligned with his worldview. His replacement, a former Boeing executive, has scant foreign policy or military experience.\n\nTrump had faced scrutiny for putting off a visit to the troops. Privately, he wondered whether such a trip would only serve to highlight wars he does not support and wants to end. But in November, after facing criticism for canceled a visit to a military cemetery in France because of rain, Trump announced he would soon travel to a war zone.\n\nOn his way back home from Iraq, Trump met with US military leaders aboard Air Force One and then visited with American troops while refueling at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nLike presidents before him, Trump's visit was shrouded in secrecy. He departed the White House quietly on Christmas night and details of his travel were very closely held within the West Wing.\n\nA decade-and-a-half after the start of the US war, which has cost nearly 5,000 American troops their lives, Iraq remains a dangerous place -- a fact not lost on the commander in chief.\n\n\"Pretty sad when you spend $7 trillion in the Middle East and going in has to be under this massive cover,\" he said.\n\nThe American-led invasion in 2003 toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but for several years afterward US troops engaged in extended fighting across the country, battling an insurgency and later sectarian violence. At their peak, US troop levels in Iraq stood near 166,000. After the combat mission ended in 2010, some troops remained behind to help stabilize the country.\n\nThousands more returned four years later to battle ISIS. Iraq formally declared victory against the terror group a year ago, but US troops have remained to help stabilize regions of the country and train Iraqi soldiers.\n\nTrump criticized his predecessor, Obama, for withdrawing troops too quickly from Iraq, claiming it allowed for ISIS' rise. Obama's administration was unable to strike a deal with the Iraqi government to allow for a residual US force to maintain stability in the country. But in bringing troops home and declaring a formal end to the Iraq War, Obama fulfilled a pledge to voters to end a war that began under Bush.\n\nTrump now finds himself eager to make good on his own promises to wind down US involvement overseas. That's what has driven his recent decisions to take US troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nBut those decisions have been unpopular among even his own national security team, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, who resigned last week. He was followed out the exit by Brett McGurk, the US special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition who Trump claims not to know.\n\nThey and other officials warned Trump that leaving the region now would allow for ISIS, or another terror group, to regain a foothold. But the President was insistent that the time had come for US personnel to come home.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Troops bringing Trump hats to sign may violate military rule", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/He0DwK8lluE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump made his first visit to a war zone on Wednesday, receiving an enthusiastic reception from many US troops there -- some of whom may have run afoul of military rules.\n\nVideo footage and the written report of Trump's visit with service members in Iraq showed the President signing \"Make America Great Again\" hats and an embroidered patch that read \"Trump 2020.\"\n\nBut troops' requests for the autographs could brush up against Department of Defense guidelines for political activities.\n\nThose guidelines say that \"active duty personnel may not engage in partisan political activities and all military personnel should avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign, or cause.\"\n\nPhotos: In photos: President Trump's holiday visit to US troops in Iraq President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump greet military personnel at the dining hall during an unannounced visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Wednesday, December 26.

The White House hasn't provided any further details about the claim, which Trump first made on Twitter on Christmas Eve.\n\nHe said he would go to the new stretch of the wall in January.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "No signs of a deal to end partial government shutdown", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/pxdzKNL4Bks/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Talks to reopen parts of the government appeared at a standstill Wednesday night, with negotiators making little progress and President Donald Trump vowing to do \"whatever it takes\" to get new funds for a border wall.\n\nCapitol Hill remained quiet over the Christmas break, and while both chambers of Congress are expected to gavel in on Thursday, there are no votes scheduled and no signs yet that lawmakers will return to Washington this week.\n\nAsked Wednesday how long he believes the partial shutdown will last, the President held firm on his position.\n\n\"Whatever it takes,\" Trump said. \"I mean, we're gonna have a wall.

He dodged the question three times before finally saying, \"I'm not going to talk about it now.\"\n\nHouse Democrats are expected to bring up a bill to reopen the government in the new session, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has made it clear he will put on the floor only legislation that has Trump's backing and could get 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican who's a close ally of the President's and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Wednesday that Trump's resolve to get $5 billion for border security is \"very firm.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, if (Democrats) believe this President is going to yield on this particular issue, they're misreading him, misreading the American people,\" Meadows told CNN's Manu Raju on \"Inside Politics.\"\n\n\"I see no evidence that would suggest he would come even close to 1.3\" billion dollars, Meadows said. \"I don't see that as a reasonable counteroffer.\"\n\nTrump claimed this week -- without explanation -- that he'd recently approved 115 miles of border barrier and he would go to the new stretch of the wall in January, though the White House hasn't provided any details on the barrier.\n\n\"It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,\" he said. \"I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis.

The recalled packages are marked on the side with establishment number P-579 and were sold in 1-pound, 2.5-pound and 3-pound packages.\n\nOn November 15 , the company issued a recall of more than 91,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products from its Barron, Wisconsin, facility.\n\nPatients who were interviewed by outbreak investigators reported buying a variety of different brands of raw turkey products from many different stores. \"A single, common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified that could account for the whole outbreak,\" the CDC said.

This bacteria was \"closely related genetically\" to the bacteria from the patients. \"This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating turkey,\" the CDC said.\n\nLykken said, \"As always, turkey remains safe to consume when handled and prepared properly. Jennie-O has information available on its website with step-by-step instructions on how to safely prepare and enjoy turkey.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers should not eat any recalled products and should take steps to prevent salmonella illness. That includes washing hands and thoroughly cooking turkey to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, as measured by a food thermometer.

by the environment secretary.\n\nThe change is contained in a government consultation aimed at further reducing the plastic used by consumers and could come into effect in January 2020.\n\nSmaller retailers, who are exempt from the current levy, supply an estimated 3.6 billion single-use bags annually.\n\nSchools in England are also being told to eliminate unnecessary plastic.\n\nEducation

\"We want to do even more to protect our precious planet and today's announcement will accelerate further behaviour change and build on the success of the existing charge.\"\n\nSince the 5p fee was introduced in 2015 for retailers with at least 250 employees, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation.\n\nTrade bodies representing about 40,000 small retailers have launched a voluntary approach to a 5p charge, but this accounts for less than one-fifth of companies likely to be affected by the proposed changes.\n\nAnalysis\n\nby Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst\n\nThe government wavered for years before imposing a plastic bag tax for England - but the result of the policy eventually introduced is crystal clear: taxes change behaviour.\n\nPeople who previously thought nothing of carting home their supermarket shopping in half a dozen flimsy plastic bags seem appalled by the prospect of a 30p charge, and dig into their handbags for nylon bags instead.\n\nA similar shift in behaviour will surely be seen now in local stores, although the change may be less marked because people tend to buy smaller quantities from corner shops, so may be willing to pay an extra 10p for convenience.\n\nIt's also possible that these convenience store bags disproportionately harm the environment because they're used by people picking up snacks while visiting beauty spots or beaches.\n\nThe announcement of a consultation on an increased charge is part of a broader move towards environmental taxation - an issue which can easily cause governments trouble if they don't protect the poorest from the impact of the taxes.\n\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags.\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society says the levies have had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea.\n\nOceanographer Laura Foster, head of Clean Seas at the MCS, said: \"We are able to measure the impact of legislation and we've seen that since the introduction of the plastic bag charge in the UK the amount we find on the beaches has gone down.\n\n\"That's also been replicated by studies that have been done offshore. They've also seen a reduction in the amount of plastic bags they find.\"\n\nWhile retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money consumers pay for plastic bags, they are expected to give it to good causes.

Sometimes it's just easier not to go out, as I get too tempted.\n\n\"Even if others don't pressurise me, you feel a silent pressure. It's a bit like being a vegan, it gets other people's backs up because they feel guilty or judged.\"\n\nHaig notes British society's obsession with drinking. \"As soon as we get that off switch we drink. Go to Gatwick and you'll see people drinking at 08:00. It's changing, young people are drinking less, but I'll never be that Mediterranean person who can have one glass of wine.\"\n\nHis tips for being a non-drinker include ordering a virgin Bloody Mary, \"it feels hedonistic\", going to a restaurant rather than a bar or pub, doing exercise to replace that space where you \"let off steam\", and saying to those who try to foist drinks on you: \"I don't drink.\"\n\n\"People think there must be a reason and don't question it.

I tell them I'm a loose canon. I make a joke out of it. Never be apologetic, people will leap on that.\"\n\n'Social loneliness'\n\nYet despite the fact that alcohol is deeply embedded in our social lives, the culture is changing. Recent figures from a study by the University of London showed that almost a third of young people don't drink at all.\n\nEven so, young people, particularly those with mental health issues, still struggle with alcohol.\n\nJennifer Griffin, psychotherapist and general manager of Turn2me - an online charitable mental health website for young people, says many of those they help find social occasions that revolve around drinking difficult.\n\n\"Alcohol is linked to anxiety and depression. Yet socialising is how young people develop a connection to their peers.

Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

Researchers had argued that keeping within this limit was necessary to avoid the most damaging effects of global warming.\n\nBut some have been pushing for an even lower target of 1.5C. In October, climate scientists released a major report detailing what would be involved in keeping the temperature rise to within that tougher limit.\n\nThis would result in millions fewer people losing their homes to rising seas, fewer species at risk of extinction and a drastic reduction in the numbers of people experiencing water scarcity.\n\nBut it would also be hugely expensive and require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to society. The report didn't tell governments what to do, but set out a range of approaches including heavy cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes.\n\nOther climate change stories from 2018\n\nThe earliest animals\n\nImage copyright ANU\n\nThe one-million-plus animal species alive today are staggeringly diverse, from the giant oceanic blue whale to the wriggly earthworms beneath our feet. But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the \"Ediacaran biota\" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.\n\nBut their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.\n\nIn September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish. Cholesterol is one of the molecular hallmarks of animal life, clearly demonstrating that the Ediacaran biota were animals.\n\nOther palaeontology stories from 2018\n\nGiant plastic berg\n\nThe world's plastic waste crisis was one of the big themes of 2018. The problem had been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet 2 series, presented by David Attenborough, which contained shocking footage of the devastation wrought on the oceans and marine life by our addiction to plastic.\n\nIn April, our Science Editor, David Shukman, visited Indonesia to report on a morass of plastic waste that had clogged rivers and canals in Bandung, on the Indonesian island of Java. The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.\n\nWorryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.\n\nOther plastic waste stories from 2018\n\nGhost particle busters\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: Blazars are powered by massive black holes\n\nNeutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.\n\nMany neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle \"ray\" straight at the Earth.\n\nThis type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.\n\nThe IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.\n\nOther astronomy stories from 2018\n\nA watery Mars - and Moon\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems Image caption The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars\n\nWe know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.\n\n\"We are not closer to actually detecting life,\" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, \"but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.\"\n\nMars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.\n\nData from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles. This ancient water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon.\n\nOther planetary science stories from 2018\n\nWhat happened to the Stonehenge builders?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Stonehenge builders were largely replaced by the Beaker people, but pockets may have lingered\n\nThe field of ancient DNA - which involves extracting and analysing genetic material from long-dead people - has provided us with unprecedented insights into the past. One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.\n\nIn a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to a girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.\n\nOther ancient DNA stories from 2018\n\nIcy impact\n\nImage copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nIn November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nThe bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.\n\nThere is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.\n\nOther earth science stories from 2018:\n\nAn earlier exodus\n\nImage copyright Israel Hershkovitz, Tel Aviv Uni Image caption The jawbone from Mislya cave in Israel dates to 185,000 years ago\n\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.\n\nIn January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.\n\nBut the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.\n\nOther human evolution stories from 2018\n\nRocks from Mars\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth\n\nAfter years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.\n\nIn April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first \"round trip\" to another planet.\n\nThe venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.\n\nUS missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.\n\nThere's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.\n\nOther space exploration stories from 2018\n\nPlastic in our water\n\nImage copyright Alice Trevail Image caption Some of the fragments are very small\n\nPlastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water. Research by the journalism organisation Orb Media found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre in major brands of bottled water.\n\nIn the largest investigation of its kind, 250 bottles bought in nine different countries were examined. Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.\n\nOur planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.\n\nThe number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean. Scientists said there was a need for more research into its effects on zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and mammals.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Japan whale hunting: Commercial whaling to restart in July", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46682976", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Japan will be free to hunt whales like the minke for commercial purposes from July onwards\n\nJapan says it is to restart commercial whaling in July in a move that is likely to draw international criticism.\n\nIt said it would withdraw from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the body tasked with whale conservation.\n\nCommercial whaling was banned by the IWC in 1986 after some species were driven almost to extinction.\n\nOfficials in Japan, an IWC member since 1951, say eating whales is part of the country's culture.\n\nFor many years Japan has hunted whales for what it calls \"scientific research\" and to sell the meat, a programme widely criticised by conservationists.\n\nWednesday's announcement had been expected, but conservation groups warn the move will have serious consequences.\n\nIt means Japan will be able to freely hunt species currently protected by the IWC, like minke whales.\n\nWhat did Japan just announce?\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshihide Suga said commercial whaling would be restricted to Japanese territorial waters and economic zones.\n\nAs a result, Japan will stop hunting in Antarctic waters and the southern hemisphere, a prospect conservation groups had welcomed before it was formally confirmed.\n\nA statement by Japan's government said the IWC was not committed enough to one of its goals, of supporting sustainable commercial whaling.\n\nIt accused the IWC of being focused only on the aim of conserving numbers.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Sushi made of whale meat and blubber sold in Miyagi prefecture\n\nA number of coastal communities in Japan have hunted whales for centuries, but consumption in the country surged only after World War Two when whales were the main source of meat. It has plummeted in recent decades.\n\nAccording to Japan's Asahi newspaper, whale meat makes up only 0.1% of all meat sold in Japan.\n\nWhat's been the reaction?\n\nIn a joint statement, Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Environment Minister Melissa Price said they were \"extremely disappointed\" with Japan's decision.\n\n\"Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so-called 'scientific' whaling,\" the statement added.\n\nBefore the formal announcement was made, Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns at Humane Society International in Australia, said Japan would be \"operating completely outside the bounds of international law\".\n\nShe added: \"This is the path of a pirate whaling nation, with a troubling disregard for international rule.\"\n\nGreenpeace Japan urged the government to reconsider, and warned it would risk criticism as the host of the G20 summit in June.\n\nSam Annesley, Greenpeace Japan's executive director, said: \"It's clear that the government is trying to sneak in this announcement at the end of year, away from the spotlight of international media, but the world sees this for what it is.\n\n\"The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures.\"\n\nWhat is the current whaling ban?\n\nIn 1986, IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting to allow stocks to recover.\n\nPro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Currently, Japan kills whales under a so-called scientific research programme\n\nInstead, it became a quasi-permanent ban. Whaling nations, such as Japan, Norway and Iceland, however argue the practice is part of their culture and should continue in a sustainable way.\n\nToday, whale stocks are carefully monitored, and while many species are still endangered, others - like the minke whale that Japan primarily hunts - are not.\n\nIn September, Tokyo tried to get the IWC to allow commercial catch quotas but the proposal was rejected.\n\nCan Japan just leave?\n\nIt will still be bound by certain international laws, despite leaving the IWC.\n\nThe UN Convention on the Law of the Sea binds countries to co-operate on the conservation of whales \"through the appropriate international organisations for their conservation, management and study\". The text does not say which international organisation that is.\n\nJapan could either try to set up another international body if it manages to get enough other countries to sign up - or join an existing one like the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco) instead.\n\nLike a smaller version of the IWC, Nammco is a grouping of pro-whaling nations - Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands - born out of frustration with the IWC.\n\nHasn't Japan been whaling all along?\n\nYes, Japan has been hunting whales for the past 30 years but under a scientific programme, granted as an exception under the IWC ban.\n\nCritics say the practice is a cover for what actually amounts to commercial whaling.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan takes hundreds of whales each year\n\nIt means that whales can be taken for scientific studies and the meat can later be sold for consumption.\n\nJapan has caught between about 200 and 1,200 whales each year, saying it is investigating stock levels to see whether the whales are endangered or not.\n\nWhy can't the IWC agree?\n\nJapan has repeatedly tried to overturn the moratorium and secure agreement on sustainable catch quotas.\n\nThe last attempt to do so came in September at an IWC summit in Brazil.\n\nJapan offered a package of measures, including setting up a Sustainable Whaling Committee and sustainable catch limits \"for abundant whale stocks/species\".\n\nThe proposal was voted down. Since then there has been talk of the country simply leaving the body so it will no longer be bound by its rules."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Chestnut-killing wasp threatens major harvest", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43377056", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Richard Duebel\n\nChestnuts are increasingly being incorporated into vegan and vegetarian diets - as well as being a Christmas favourite. But a small, invasive wasp from China is threatening the chestnut harvest in Spain.\n\nNow government scientists are considering releasing another non-native insect into the environment to keep the wasp population under control.\n\nUnder the dense green cover of the Genal Valley in southern Spain, Julio Ruiz, a thirty-something farmer is collecting sweet chestnuts (casta\u00f1as) with his father, mother and brother.\n\nThey are picking up the prickly nuts from the leaf-strewn earth, recognising through experience those that will contain the prized, large-sized chestnut.\n\nBut this year there are far fewer chestnuts to gather not just on the Ruiz family's 30-hectare farm, but throughout the 4,000 hectares of the lush Genal Valley famed for its plentiful chestnuts thanks to its micro-climate.\n\n\"We've lost at least 30% of our usual production,\" explains Julio. \"It is all the fault of a small wasp. You can't tell there's anything wrong until the damage has been done.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption A micro-climate in the 400-hectare valley is said to contribute to its success at growing chestnuts\n\nAt the nearby co-operative collection point and weighing station talk is of little else. The chestnut gall wasp, Dryoscomus kuriphillus katsumatsu (avispilla in local Spanish), is causing huge environmental and economic damage in the Valley where the harvest accounts for 10 million euros' worth of income annually.\n\n\"We may be the biggest producers of chestnuts in Andalucia,\" says Felipe Javier Cabos Aguilar, president of the regional association of chestnut producers shaking his head sadly.\n\n\"But that just means we are the most vulnerable.\"\n\nAccording to Antonio Pulido, a forest engineer who has been overseeing the fight against the pest, the avispilla is a parasitic insect that comes from China.\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Antonio Pulido and Julio Ruiz inspecs an infected chestnut tree\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption A chestnut bud damaged by the Chinese wasp\n\n\"It's considered an exotic species that has no natural indigenous predators,\" he says.\n\n\"The main infestation is in the bud where growth is stunted. As a result the flowers and fruit cannot develop and the health and vitality of the tree is compromised. Every variety of chestnut is affected.\"\n\nOver the last three years since the infestation first arrived in the area, countless trees have died. Over the generations each plot of land, or finca, has been divided between offspring with the chestnut proving the most lucrative of all the crops.\n\nAlthough cork and other trees grow in abundance, most farmers depend on chestnuts that are exported to France for specialist processing.\n\nIn order to limit the damage, some farmers are burning the infected trees to protect those who aren't affected. \"This is increasing the risk of forest fires,\" says Antonio Pulido.\n\n\"It is also adding to urban drift as young people in the villages see their future disappearing in front of their eyes.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Here, sweet chestnuts are prepared at a local restaurant. They are also a major export\n\nCastanea sativa, called the sweet chestnut to distinguish it from the horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanus (to which it is only distantly related), offers the region unique potential.\n\nThe sizeable vegan and vegetarian markets of northern Europe have already developed an appetite for sweet chestnuts.\n\nNow that potential uplift for a impoverished part of a poor region of Spain is under threat.\n\nIn Malaga, at the laboratories of IFAPA-Churriana - an agriculture and fisheries investigation unit of the Andalucian Government (Junta de Andalucia), Juan-Ramon Boyero Gallardo is looking under the microscope at Torimus sinensis, the natural predator of the avispilla.\n\nIt also comes from China. He confirms that this parasitoid insect is capable of helping keep the spread of the infestation under control.\n\nThe Chinese predator has had a high rate of success in Japan, Italy and North America where the infestation appeared prior to arriving in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHowever, he remains hesitant about releasing the predator into the Genal Valley.\n\n\"The problem of introducing a further exotic species such as Torimus sinensis is that it can invade the natural woodland, attack indigenous species, displace others and alter the overall biodiversity,\" he cautions.\n\nImage copyright Gyorgy Csoka, Hungary Forest Research Institute, B Image caption The oriental chestnut gall wasp has already appeared in other regions of the world, such as North America\n\nAlthough the unforeseen repercussions might have a negative impact, there has been a limited release of a tiny number of the predator species in the Genal Valley.\n\nJuan-Ramon Boyero Gallardo says he is optimistic that Torimus sinensis and local predators will slow down the spread of the avispilla.\n\nHe views the plague (plaga in local Spanish) as just another example of the disadvantages of globalisation.\n\n\"We know that the United States have very strict controls over bringing vegetation in to the country, yet they too have been infested\" he says.\n\n\"With container-loads of produce arriving in the port of Malaga from lots of different countries around the world, there is little we can do to prevent the arrival of exotic species.\"\n\nHe goes on to comment: \"If we take a wider view this is another example of the unintentional globalisation of parasites and the problems facing scientists as they search for ways of eradicating, or at least limiting the pest,\" he says.\n\nHowever the more pressing need is to prevent the mass destruction of chestnut trees and uphold the economy of the Genal Valley - not to mention the supply of chestnut stuffing and the luxury marrons glaces so beloved at Christmas."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Top TV Shows Of 2018", "article_link": "https://entertainment.theonion.com/top-tv-shows-of-2018-1831298037", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The Americans: The hit FX series ends with Elizabeth and Philip Jennings returning to the Soviet Union after realizing that the crumbling communist state still has better long-term potential as a country than the United States.\n\nSorry For Your Loss: This poignant half-hour drama wasn\u2019t afraid to meditate on heavy themes such as loss, grief, and producing a digital streaming service called Facebook Watch.\n\nQueer Eye: A cultural sensation that caused the number of gay people in the U.S. to triple.\n\nBig Mouth: There are too many shows.\n\nGLOW: GLOW captivated audiences from the moment it began autoplaying on Netflix.\n\nThe Beauty Of Mother Earth: Sure, stare at your idiot box all you like, friend.

Further east in Bangladesh, close to a million Rohingya refugees were trapped in limbo, too scared of persecution to return to Myanmar.\n\nThe year also witnessed large waves of people forced to flee their homes in Ethiopia, Venezuela, Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nAnd as we look ahead into 2019, there are at least three major crises that are likely to get a lot worse.\n\nContinuing displacement in Cameroon\n\nFor a long time, Cameroon has been providing a safe haven for people fleeing conflicts in neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR) and Nigeria, but the country has its own simmering crisis.\n\nSeveral armed groups have sprung up to fight for independence in English-speaking parts of Cameroon since October 2017, which has resulted in severe security clampdowns in these areas. The situation deteriorated rapidly during the last six months, partly because of the 2018 presidential elections and movement restrictions on civilians. The displacement of more than 400,000 people attracted little international media attention and there was little diplomatic effort to ease the tensions.\n\nA disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration committee has been set up by the Cameroonian government, and a presidential decree has been issued authorising the release of some people detained during the clashes. But the upcoming local elections in 2019 could see the crisis escalate further. It could also spill over to neighbouring Nigeria - a dreadful scenario.\n\nAt the same time, given that Cameroon is not identified as a hotspot by the international community, little funding will be committed to addressing the crisis, which would affect not only Cameroonians but also displaced people from CAR and northeast Nigeria.\n\nYemen's looming famine\n\nThis year saw the war in Yemen hammer civilians harder than ever, after three years of armed conflict had already decimated infrastructure, public services and uprooted two million people from their homes.\n\nWe, the agencies on the ground in Yemen, warn collectively of an impending famine. This mass starvation will not be caused by failed harvests or natural disasters. In Yemen, civilians are being slowly starved to death by a man-made catastrophe. The warfare, access restrictions and sanctions imposed on the civilian population by the warring parties and the nations propping them are solely to blame.\n\nPeace talks in Stockholm earlier this month led to a long overdue ceasefire agreement for the crucial port city of Hodeidah. However, millions of women, men and children in dire need are yet to see the effects of the agreements on the ground in Yemen, where clashes are still ongoing.\n\nThe UK, United States, France, Iran and other powers that support parties to the conflict in Yemen's must use their influence to bring about a permanent end to the violence.\n\nParties to this conflict already have blood on their hands. Next year, they risk bearing responsibility for a famine that could affect millions, if the agreements made in Stockholm are not put into effect immediately.\n\nThe DRC's forgotten crisis\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo saw pockets of insecurity spread like wildfire to entire regions in 2018. Inter-communal violence escalated in the previously peaceful province of Ituri. Countless armed groups continue to fight each other and attack civilians in the east and central parts of this vast country. In the few cases when families were able to return to their homes, they face such destruction that they need aid to survive.\n\nIn addition to spiralling violence, hunger levels soared this year. In 2018, DRC saw a 100 percent increase in food insecurity compared with 2017.\n\nGlobal attention will momentarily shift to the troubled nation on December 30 as the Congolese people head to the polls to elect a new president, but the country will not stay under the media spotlight for long.\n\nThe DRC's mega-crisis is likely to go largely underreported in 2019, as the situation continues to deteriorate. Countless more people will edge towards starvation. Unless violence and displacement end and the humanitarian response is strengthened, many parents will watch their children die from malnutrition and preventable diseases.\n\nHumanitarian aid can somewhat alleviate the suffering of Congolese, Yemeni and Cameroonian people, but only if donor countries step up their funding and warring factions give us access to communities caught up in conflict. That said, only political solutions to these conflicts can really prevent the impending human catastrophes.\n\nIt is unthinkable that so many people can starve to death in a world that has the means and the technology to feed everyone. These are all preventable deaths in a world of plenty and it will weigh on our conscience if we don't prevent them.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "How Native Americans adopted slavery from white settlers", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/native-americans-adopted-slavery-white-settlers-181225180750948.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Last week marked the 153rd anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1865. Rightly celebrated as a milestone for the black American community, the 13th Amendment led to the eventual liberation of all African Americans enslaved in the United States of the late 19th century. But the 13th Amendment did not free all black enslaved people in the boundaries of modern-day US.\n\nMembers of five Native American nations, the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole Nations (known as the Five Tribes), owned black slaves. Then located outside the territorial boundaries of the US in a region known as Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), these sovereign nations were not affected by proclamations or constitutional amendments. Instead, separate treaties had to be made between the US and these Native American nations not only to free enslaved peoples, but also to formally end the American Civil War battles and antagonism between American and Native American troops.\n\nThe fact that by the time of the Civil War black chattel slavery had been an element of life among the Five Tribes for decades is rarely discussed. It is, however, an important aspect of US history which serves to remind us of the complexity of colonialism, exploitation and victimisation that laid the foundations of our country.\n\nCaptivity and slavery among Native Americans\n\nThe indigenous peoples of North America had utilised a form of captive-taking and involuntary labour long before European contact. But this form of bondage was neither trans-generational nor permanent. Captive-taking was most often used to replace a dead loved one within the family with a new person. The captive would then take on this deceased person's sexual or labour-related capacities.\n\nThrough various avenues, such as \"sexual relationships, adoption, hard work, military service, or escape, captives could enhance their status or even assume new identities.\" After European contact in the 1500s, white Europeans persuaded Native Americans to enslave members of other Native American tribes using the European method of slave-trading, which focused on the accumulation of captives for sale and thus, profit, rather than for population augmentation.\n\nThe Native American slave trade thrived for over a century, but began to be largely phased out in the early to mid-18th century. An important factor in its decline was the Yamasee War of 1715-1717. After colonists in the English colony of Carolina began defaulting on some of their trade agreements and enslaving even members of their ally tribes, the Yamasee Nation began to question its own alliance with Carolina. Along with the Lower Creeks and the Savannahs, the Yamasees declared war on Carolina, killing 400 colonists, approximately seven percent of the white population. The Carolinian colonists put together a force of black slaves, militiamen, volunteers and friendly Native American nations, which defeated the Yamasees and their allies.\n\nWhile the Yamasees lost, they succeeded in forcing European colonists to reconsider the risks inherent in the system of Native American enslavement. If Native Americans became angry at the terms of enslavement or allied Native Americans were accidentally enslaved, they might once again retaliate militarily. In addition, enslaved Native Americans often successfully escaped from their owners, as they were familiar with the geography and could elude slave catchers and return to their homelands.\n\nTherefore, after the Yamasee War, the African transatlantic slave trade to the North American colonies drastically increased to account for the loss of Native American slaves.\n\nSome members of the Five Tribes became owners of enslaved black women and men themselves, as they increasingly adapted to Euro-American norms, such as style of dress and governmental structure. Beginning in the late 1700s and intensifying in the early 1800s, members of the Five Tribes used enslaved black women and men as domestic and agricultural labourers. For example, Chickasaw planters exported an estimated 1,000 bales of cotton in 1830; this cotton was picked and processed by black slaves. Comparatively, in 1826, the state of Georgia produced 150,000 bales of cotton.\n\nIn 1860, about 30 years after their removal to Indian Territory from their respective homes in the Southeast, Cherokee Nation citizens owned 2,511 slaves (15 percent of their total population), Choctaw citizens owned 2,349 slaves (14 percent of their total population), and Creek citizens owned 1,532 slaves (10 percent of their total population). Chickasaw citizens owned 975 slaves, which amounted to 18 percent of their total population, a proportion equivalent to that of white slave owners in Tennessee, a former neighbour of the Chickasaw Nation and a large slaveholding state.\n\nThis made the Chickasaws the largest slave-holding nation of the Five Tribes, in proportion to their population. National laws restricted the movement of enslaved people, preventing them from learning to read and write, and prohibited interracial relationships.\n\nHowever, as in the US, the majority of people in these nations did not own slaves. Large-scale crop production and the system of slavery that made it possible and lucrative were mainly adopted by wealthier Native families, whose prosperity allowed them to influence the political, social, and economic affairs of their nations. Thus, an influential proportion of tribal citizens stood to lose a vital part of their economic resources if emancipation took place.\n\nThe Five Tribes involved themselves in the Civil War militarily to preserve their practice of slavery and to fight for political autonomy. Members of all nations served on both the Union and Confederate sides of the war, and a number of battles took place within Indian Territory. After the war, the treaties signed between the US and all five of these slaveholding Native American nations, called the Treaties of 1866, ended wartime hostilities and freed and enfranchised people of African descent. These treaties were part of a larger American mission to take over Native American land, and also included land cessions and American settlement and railway construction in Indian Territory.\n\nCitizenship rights\n\nWhile the former slaves of the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, and Choctaw Nations became tribal citizens due to the Treaties of 1866, throughout the 20th century, all of the Five Tribes eventually rescinded the tribal membership of these freedpeople and their descendants. Although their former slaves had lived among them for generations, sharing land, history, and trauma with them, the Five Tribes claimed that they were interlopers who had no place among them because they had no Native ancestry.\n\nThe descendants of these former slaves fought back, filing several lawsuits. On August 31, 2017, the descendants of people enslaved by members of the Cherokee Nation were victorious. The US District Court in Washington ruled that these descendants should have citizenship rights in the Cherokee Nation. Now the descendants of people enslaved by the Creek Nation have filed a similar suit, hoping to find commensurate validation.\n\nSo, when we observe and honour the anniversary of the 13th Amendment, let us remember that not all people of African descent had the same experience of freedom. Those African Americans living among western indigenous nations waited until the summer of 1866 to gain their freedom, and even then, they fought to find true liberation from economic, social, and political duress.\n\nJust as our current moment sees white and black Americans arguing over the memory of the Civil War and the removal (or not) of Confederate monuments, so discussions of slavery in Native American nations and the historical relationships between the Five Tribes and people of African descent are also fraught with many difficult issues.\n\nThe story of the people of African descent owned by Native Americans is unique, but also simply another tale of coercion and community in the diverse African American experience.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Indonesia raises alert, reroutes flights around erupting volcano", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/indonesia-raises-alert-reroutes-flights-erupting-volcano-181227030312027.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Authorities in Indonesia have rerouted all flights around the erupting Anak Krakatoa volcano, days after it is believed to have triggered a devastating tsunami that killed hundreds of people and caused widespread destruction.\n\nThe move on Thursday by Indonesia's air traffic control agency AirNav came as the volcanic island located in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra continued spewing columns of ash into the air.\n\n\"All flights are rerouted due to Krakatoa volcano ash on red alert,\" AirNav said in a statement.\n\nAuthorities also raised the volcano's alert level to the second-highest - \"stand-by\" - and widened an exclusion zone around it to 5km.\n\nA crater collapse on Anak Krakatoa at high tide on Saturday night is thought to have sent waves smashing into the Indonesian shoreline, engulfing fishing villages and popular resorts along the coasts of western Java and southern Sumatra.\n\nThe confirmed death toll is 430 people, with at least 159 others missing.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Visits US Troops in Iraq on Unannounced Trip", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-us-troops-in-iraq-on-unannounced-trip/4717897.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump has made an unannounced trip to Iraq to visit U.S. troops stationed there.

Some things, like an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, could be out of reach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to enter the 2020 presidential campaign [cycle], and that will affect how Congress spends its time, what issues it\u2019s active on.

Bush visited U.S. troops stationed overseas eight times during his presidency, including serving a Thanksgiving meal to soldiers in Baghdad in 2003. President Barak Obama visited troops in Baghdad in April 2009, four months after he took office. He also visited troops in Afghanistan and South Korea.\n\nThe Pentagon said there are about 5,200 U.S. forces in Iraq.\n\nIn Washington, a partial shutdown has closed a quarter of the U.S. government after Congress failed to fund Trump\u2019s proposed wall on the southern border with Mexico.\n\nLast week, Trump made the controversial move of announcing plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. He also is considering withdrawing roughly half of the more than 14,000 American troops stationed in Afghanistan, beginning next month.\n\nTrump\u2019s senior advisers and military officials have warned the move will plunge the region further into chaos.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis and the special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter IS, Brett McGurk, have both resigned, at least in part in disagreement over policy in Syria and Afghanistan."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Government Shutdown Enters Day 5", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-government-shutdown-enters-day-5/4716500.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:57", "body_paragraphs": "The partial shutdown of the U.S. government entered its fifth day Wednesday, with no public indication a resolution is imminent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke about the shutdown Tuesday, asserting that it will continue until his demand for funds to construct a U.S.-Mexico border wall are met.\n\n\"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open.

After a weekend and two holiday days for federal employees, Wednesday was the first regularly scheduled workday affected by the shutdown.\n\nTrump claimed the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed due to the shutdown also want the wall, despite a lack of evidence supporting the contention.\n\nOn Monday, Trump asserted Democrats \"must end\" the standoff while Democratic leaders in Congress blamed Trump for \"plunging the country into chaos.\"\n\n\"The president wanted the shutdown, but seems not to know how to get himself out of it,\" Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a joint statement. \"\n\nWhile government agencies dealing with national security and public safety remain open, other offices are closed and 800,000 federal workers are on furlough.

Opposition Democrats won back control of the House of Representatives in the November midterm elections, and that could have a profound impact on the next two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nA preview of what the year ahead could look like came in the December 11 Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe verbal jousting over the president\u2019s demand for a border wall with Mexico is likely the first of many partisan showdowns ahead given that Democrats will hold the majority in the House beginning in early January.\n\n\u201cDemocrats will certainly use their majority to highlight some differences with Donald Trump and to investigate the Trump administration,\u201d said John Fortier of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a recent guest on VOA\u2019s \u201cEncounter\u201d program. \u201cAnd then we will be spending this year leading into the presidential election of 2020, so it is a transition year.\u201d\n\nInvestigations ahead\n\n\n\nDemocrats fueled their midterm victory with opposition to President Donald Trump spurred by a strong turnout from women and progressive voters on behalf of candidates like Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley.\n\n\u201cWe have affirmed that while this could go down as the darkest time in our history, we will not let it be. And instead, we will be defined by our hopes, not our fears,\u201d Pressley told supporters on election night.\n\nDemocrats picked up 40 House seats but Republicans bolstered their majority in the Senate and will hold a 53-to-47-seat edge in January.\n\nEven though Trump now faces the prospect of a stalled legislative agenda and numerous oversight investigations launched by House Democrats, he remains defiant.\n\n\u201cAlmost from the time I announced I was going to run, they have been giving us this investigation fatigue.

That is probably unfortunate, but that shapes everything going forward,\u201d said McKee.\n\nGiven the political reset between Congress and the White House and the uncertainty of what the Russia investigation will find, what happens in 2019 could go a long way to determining whether Donald Trump is a one-term or two-term president."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Japan to Leave International Whaling Commission; Resume Commercial Whaling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-to-leave-international-whaling-commission-resume-commercial-whaling/4717431.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:57", "body_paragraphs": "Japan will withdraw from the International Whaling Commission and resume commercial whaling in July.

They found that neither group has higher rates than the other of death overall or of early deaths. Both groups do tend to outlast the\n\nrest of us, however.\n\nAstronauts are generally well-educated, more affluent and more physically fit than the typical American, and some previous research has linked this career to a lower risk of premature death, the study team notes in Occupational & Environmental Medicine.\n\nBut much of the previous research on mortality rates in astronauts hasn't accounted for the mental and physical demands of this career, or the so-called \"healthy worker effect\" that leads people with employment of any kind to typically have fewer medical issues than individuals who are unable to work, said study co-author Robert Reynolds of Mortality Research &\n\nConsulting Inc. in City of Industry, Calif.\n\nComparable group needed\n\n\"The challenge has always been to understand if astronauts are as healthy as they would be had they been otherwise comparably employed but had never gone to space at all,\" Reynolds said by email. \"To do this, we needed to find a group that is comparable on several important factors, but has never\n\nbeen to space.\"\n\nThe researchers compared mortality rates for male U.S. astronauts to those of professional athletes from Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association between 1960 and mid-2018.\n\nBoth athletes and astronauts had a lower risk of premature death than the general population, the study found. And there was no meaningful mortality difference between NBA and MLB players.\n\nAstronauts were more likely to die of accidents and other external causes, and less likely to die from heart disease and all other natural causes, the study also found.\n\n\"We cannot be sure from the data we have, but we speculate that cardiovascular fitness in particular is the most important factor in astronaut longevity,\" Reynolds said.\n\nThe results suggest that radiation exposure in space might not lead to a premature death for astronauts due to heart problems or certain cancers, the study authors conclude. In fact, astronauts had a lower rate of death from heart disease than the NBA and MLB players, and had cancer mortality similar to the athletes' rates.\n\nThe study wasn't designed to prove whether or how space travel may directly impact human health. It also didn't examine mortality among female astronauts or athletes.\n\nLower radiation exposure\n\nRadiation exposure may also have been much lower during early missions to the moon and not reflect what would happen with the current generation of astronauts, said Francis Cucinotta, a researcher at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\n\"The missions in the past were low dose, while in the future the dose would be 50 to 100 times higher for a Mars mission,\" Cucinotta said by email.\n\nAstronauts have typically never smoked, leading to a lower risk of heart disease than the general population, Cucinotta added.\n\nDiet and exercise also set astronauts and professional athletes apart from the rest of the population, said Michael Delp, a researcher at Florida State University in Tallahassee who wasn't involved in the study.\n\n\"When physical fitness is a requisite part of a job, such as with astronauts and professional athletes, this is a major determinant of the healthy worker effect,\" Delp said by email.\n\nEven for the rest of us, \"remaining or becoming physically active and maintaining a well-balanced diet greatly improves overall health and well-being, and can enhance successful aging,\" Delp said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Israel to Allow Medical Marijuana Exports", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-allow-medical-marijuana-exports/4716777.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:01:58", "body_paragraphs": "Israel\u2019s Parliament has unanimously approved a law to permit exports of medical marijuana, allowing Israel to tap the lucrative global market.\n\nIsrael will become the third country, after the Netherlands and Canada, to take its medical cannabis global.\n\nThe Israeli medical cannabis company iCAN predicts the global industry will reach $33 billion in the next five years, as stigma fades and demand grows for the few countries certified to export.\n\nThe law was approved late Tuesday, sending cannabis company shares rising by about 10 percent.\n\nThe law was stalled for years over fears from security officials that medical marijuana would leak into the black market.

But many practitioners agree that tech use is increasingly intertwined with the problems of those seeking help.\n\nAn American Academy of Pediatrics review of worldwide research found that excessive use of video games alone is a serious problem for as many as 9 percent of young people. This summer, the World Health Organization also added \"gaming disorder\" to its list of afflictions.

He spoke on the condition that he not be identified, fearing he might harm his career in an industry he's long loved.\n\nAs a toddler, he sat on his dad's lap in their Seattle area home as they played simple video games on a Mac Classic II computer. By early elementary school, he got his first Super Nintendo system and spent hours playing Yoshi's Story, a game where the main character searched for \"lucky fruit.\"\n\nAs he grew, so did one of the world's major tech hubs. Led by Microsoft, it rose from the nondescript suburban landscape and farm fields here, just a short drive from the home he still shares with his mom, who split from her husband when their only child was 11.\n\nAs a teen, he took an interest in music and acting but recalls how playing games increasingly became a way to escape life. \"I go online instead of dealing with my feelings,\" he says.\n\nHe'd been seeing a therapist for depression and severe social anxiety. But attending college out of state allowed more freedom and less structure, so he spent even more time online. His grades plummeted, forcing him to change majors, from engineering to business.\n\nAfter graduating in 2016 and moving home, he'd go to a nearby restaurant or the library to use the Wi-Fi, claiming he was looking for a job but having no luck.\n\nInstead, he was spending hours on Reddit, an online forum where people share news and comments, or viewing YouTube videos. Sometimes, he watched online porn.\n\n\u200b'Detox'\n\nOthers who attend a 12-step meeting of the Internet & Tech Addiction Anonymous know the struggle.\n\n\"I had to be convinced that this was a 'thing,\"' says Walker, a 19-year-old from Washington whose parents insisted he get help after video gaming trashed his first semester of college. He agreed to speak only if identified by first name, as required by the 12-step tenets.\n\nHelp is found at facilities like reSTART. Clients \"detox\" from tech at a secluded ranch and move on to a group home.\n\nThey commit to eating well and regular sleep and exercise. They find jobs, and many eventually return to college. They also make \"bottom line\" promises to give up video games or any other problem content, as well as drugs and alcohol, if those are issues. They use monitored smartphones with limited function \u2014 calls, texts and emails and access to maps.\n\nThe young tech worker didn't go to reSTART. But he, too, has apps on his phone that send reports about what he's viewing to his 12-step sponsor, a fellow tech addict named Charlie, a 30-year-old reSTART graduate.\n\nAt home, the young man also persuaded his mom to get rid of Wi-Fi to lessen the temptation.\n\nHe still relapses every couple months, often when he's tired or upset or very bored. He tells himself that his problem isn't as bad as other tech addicts.\n\n\"Then,\" the young man says, \"I discover very quickly that I am actually an addict, and I do need to do this.\"\n\nHaving Charlie to lean on helps. \"He's a role model,\" he says.\n\n\"He has a place of his own.

The issue may mean new rules and more regulations in the future.\n\nThe question of who can access personal user data through technology caused many people to rethink how much they trust these companies with their private information. At a recent hearing, House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy grilled Google over accusations it uses algorithms to suppress conservative voices.\n\n\"Are America's technology companies serving as instruments of freedom? Or instruments of control? Are they fulfilling the promise of the digital age? Are they advancing the cause of self-government? Or are they serving as instruments of manipulation used by powerful interests and foreign governments to rob the people of their power, agency, and dignity?,\" he said.\n\nAt the hearing, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he runs the U.S. technology giant without political preference.\n\nIn October, Google acknowledged that several months earlier, it had discovered a data breach involving its Google Plus service, which the company said would be shut down.\n\nPantas Sutardja, chief executive of data storage company LatticeWork Inc., says such scandals are forcing the companies to take a closer look at how they manage and protect user content.\n\n\"2018 has been a challenging year for tech companies and consumers alike. Company CEOs being called to Congress for hearings and promising profusely to fix the problems of data breach but still cannot do it,\" said Sutardja.\n\nAlso this year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced tough questions from U.S. lawmakers over a breach that allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to exploit the data of millions of Facebook users. Zuckerberg apologized to lawmakers, but some legislators say the giant social network cannot be trusted to regulate itself.\n\nSeparately, the attorney-general for Washington, Karl Racine, said the U.S. capital had sued Facebook over reports involving Cambridge Analytica's use of data from the social media giant.\n\nThe year saw new revelations that foreign operatives were using social media to secretly spread divisive and often bogus messages in the United States and worldwide. Walt Mossberg, a former tech journalist, says consumers are frustrated.\n\n\"It doesn't matter to whose benefit they were operating. What bothers people here is that a foreign country, using our social networks, digital products and services that we have come to feel comfortable in, a foreign government has come in and used that against us,\" he said.\n\nThe Facebook data breach has prompted companies like Latticework to create new ways for users to protect their information and themselves, Sutardja says.\n\n\"Despite apologizing profusely about leaking customer data, they can't do anything about it because their real master, their boss is Wall Street,\" he said.\n\nUser data was just one area in which tech firms came under criticism.Under pressure, social media companies tightened restrictions on the kinds of speech they tolerate on their sites.\n\nAnd workers pressed managers about their companies' government contracts and treatment of female colleagues.\n\nMossberg says he wants federal law to limit U.S. internet firms' collection and use of personal data.\n\n\"These are giant companies now. There really are four or five of them that control everything. And governments and citizens of countries around the world need the right to regulate them without closing down free speech. And that's tricky,\" he said.\n\nMossberg says he has given up Facebook."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Putin Says 'Invulnerable' New Hypersonic Nuclear Missile Is Ready For Deployment", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hypersonic-nuclear-missile-russia_us_5c248de8e4b08aaf7a8dbc40", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:02", "body_paragraphs": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a test Wednesday of a new hypersonic glide vehicle, declaring that the weapon is impossible to intercept and will ensure Russia\u2019s security for decades to come.\n\nSpeaking to Russia\u2019s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry\u2019s control room, Putin said the successful test was a \u201cgreat success\u201d and an \u201cexcellent New Year\u2019s gift to the nation.\u201d\n\nThe test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nPutin\u2019s hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump\u2019s campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions.\n\nThe Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s test, the weapon was launched from the Dombarovskiy missile base in the southern Ural Mountains.

Democrats in Congress, however, fare substantially less badly than their GOP equivalents \u2015 a shift from the shutdown this January, after which the ratings were more evenly distributed.\n\nAmericans disapprove of the handling of the shutdown by Congress as a whole (by a 33-point margin), congressional Republicans (29 points), President Trump (14 points) and congressional Democrats (9 points). Members of Congress fare better with their constituents: Americans are split 35/37 in approving or disapproving of their own representatives\u2019 performance.\n\nPundits often seem to envision public opinions in the wake of shutdowns as a zero-sum game, in which the public assigns blame to one side and absolves the other. Survey questions asked about such battles often lend themselves to such frames as well.\n\nBut the reality of how Americans think about the shutdowns isn\u2019t necessarily so clear-cut. Partisans tend to heap condemnation on their opponents, but aren\u2019t necessarily ecstatic about their own side\u2019s decisions. Other people, especially if they follow politics only casually, may be more likely to write the whole thing off as Washington dysfunction. (To get a better sense of how people view the shutdown, we also asked survey respondents to explain in their own words what was happening. You can see some of their responses at the end of the article.)\n\nEven when shutdowns appear politically damaging, the effects can be short-lived. In 2013, Republicans saw their numbers plunge historically following a shutdown. But within months, the opprobrium wore off, leaving the GOP to go on to a sweeping victory in the following year\u2019s midterms.\n\nIn the newest survey, just under half of Americans say Trump is at least somewhat responsible for the shutdown, with about 39 percent saying congressional Democrats bear at least partial responsibility, and about 30 percent that Republicans in Congress do. (Some of the people polled, before being asked the question, were informed that President Trump had both pronounced himself \u201cproud to shut down the government\u201d and later blamed the impending closure on the Democrats. It didn\u2019t appear to have a dramatic effect on the overall results.)\n\nForty-five percent of Americans say Trump should have compromised on the border wall to prevent gridlock, while 35 percent say he was right not to compromise even though it led to a partial shutdown. The other 20 percent aren\u2019t sure.\n\nMost Americans Don\u2019t Consider Partial Shutdown \u2018Very Serious\u2019; 1 In 10 Say They\u2019ll Feel Personal Effects\n\nA tenth of Americans say they\u2019ve been personally affected by the partial shutdown, or that they expect they will be. In many cases, they\u2019re taking the definition of \u201caffected\u201d rather lightly (\u201cI have to hear it incessantly on the news\u201d), broadly (\u201cEverything government does will always affect the people\u201d), or hypothetically (\u201cWhat if I want to go to a [national] park?\u201d).\n\nHundreds of thousands of government workers, however, are furloughed or working without pay, with effects that often ripple beyond their immediate families.\n\n\u201cMy brother works for the Federal Government and his family and he will be directly affected,\u201d wrote one man who was polled. \u201cWe will send them money to help out.\u201d A Democrat, he held Trump and the Republicans responsible for the shutdown, but approved of his own party\u2019s response.\n\nSeveral other furloughed workers also described themselves as unhappy with Trump\u2019s actions, though not all felt that way.\n\n\u201cMy husband is one of those non-essential employees that eventually gets paid for sitting home,\u201d wrote one Republican woman. \u201cWe are punished with the stress of waiting for a paycheck and living out of our savings because they want to play politics with people\u2019s livelihoods to work out details of how we spend our tax payer money.\u201d She said the president and both parties in Congress were all at least partially responsible for the shutdown, but believed Trump was right not to compromise.\n\nThe partial shutdown hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the broader public either, despite the holiday weekend. Most Americans say they\u2019re following the news at least as closely as usual, and nearly 60 percent say they\u2019ve been paying at least some attention to the shutdown.\n\nSixty-one percent consider the partial shutdown to be at least a serious problem, similar to the share who said the same of the shutdown this January. Just 29 percent, however, consider it very serious.\n\nIn Their Own Words\n\nIn order to get a better sense of how different Americans across the country are following and reacting to the news, we also asked survey respondents to briefly describe what was happening with the partial shutdown. A small sampling of the responses are below, sorted by 2016 presidential vote. Some answers have been edited lightly for length or clarity,\n\nExplanations From Clinton Voters:\n\n- \u201cBoth parties of our government can not come to an agreement on the proposed wall that President Trump wants to build, or should I say where that funding should come from.\u201d\n\n- \u201cColonel Bonespurs, the bloated orange pimple in our White House, wants to waste billions of our tax money and the Republicans won\u2019t oppose his stupidity but the Democrats will. So he won\u2019t sign what\u2019s necessary to keep the government operating until he gets the wall-money to flush down the toilet.\u201d\n\n- \u201cSome departments of the government will be sending people home or people will be working for free \u2015 this money will hopefully be restored to them at a later time.\u201d\n\n- \u201cAccording to the meeting between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said that he would shut down the government and it would be on him but today he\u2019s blaming the Democrats. He knows he\u2019s not going to get a wall built on the southern border, and now he says it\u2019s a \u2018beautiful fence\u2019 instead of a wall. What we need is border protection which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a wall....If I had my way both the House, Senate and the President should be locked in a room and nobody gets to go home until SOMETHING is passed!\u201d\n\n- \u201cAfter Trump decided to sign a CR approved by the Senate, talking right wing heads convinced him to not sign the CR.\u201d\n\n- \u201cDemocrats and Republicans are not agreeing on stuff.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI haven\u2019t been following the event. I wasn\u2019t even aware it is happening.\u201d\n\nExplanations From Trump Voters:\n\n- \u201dBiggest issue: border security. Democrats want no wall, and are stalling until they control the House in January. Republicans want to get a budget with a wall passed now, for the same reason.\u201d\n\n- \u201dA bunch of unnecessary government workers got sent home because the Democrats don\u2019t care about our security and want to flood the country with illegals that they want to turn into Democrat voters.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIt was triggered by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter broadcasting their comments saying Trump was weak, and Trump had to prove otherwise.\u201d\n\n- \u201cSenate Republicans do not have the 60 votes necessary to pass the spending bill passed in the House of Representatives that aligns with Trump\u2019s vision for border security by constructing a wall or barrier. Democrats refuse to compromise to secure our southern border and Trump refuses to cave in to Democratic demands. Typical Washington gridlock!\u201d\n\n- \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care right now. It is Christmas time and Im not going to let liberals and Democrats bring it down for me so I tend to ignore it lately.\u201d\n\n- \u201cPolitics as usual. The Dems and GOP can\u2019t agree that the sky is blue.\u201d\n\nExplanations From Non-Voters:\n\n- \u201cDue to the inability for both parties in Congress to reach an agreement on the budget for the following months (due to the budget for the border wall being attached to said bill), Congress adjourned with no budget for the country approved.\u201d\n\n- \u201dI think that it\u2019s very unnecessary to shut the government down because of a wall.\u201d\n\n- \u201dDemocrats are playing politics for a measly (relative to our budget) $5 billion. They don\u2019t want any type of wall because Trump will get re-elected. The government shutdown is solely on them. And who cares if the government shuts down?? It should STAY shut down.\u201d\n\n- \u201cPresident Trump has shut down the government because he can\u2019t get funding for a pet project.\u201d\n\n- \u201dFrom what I know, they can\u2019t agree on something and if they don\u2019t make a decision soon, the government will shut down until they can. I might have my facts wrong, too. I don\u2019t remember what it was they couldn\u2019t agree on.\u201d\u2032\n\n- \u201cGirl, I don\u2019t know. I just deliver pizzas.\u201d\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 22-23 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

In 2013, Lystra sued her OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he had sexually harassed her.\n\nBy Barbara Feder Ostrov and Harriet Blair Rowan\n\nThe doctor instructed his patient to stand in front of him. He cupped her crotch and inserted his fingers into her vagina through her clothes, moving his hand repeatedly to her rectal area. Then he squeezed her breasts, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of California.\n\nThe patient, accompanied to the appointment by her 4-year-old granddaughter, asked why that was necessary to diagnose a urinary tract infection, according to the documents. He told her to let him do his job.\n\nIn three other cases, the board alleged that the family doctor, Ramon Fakhoury of California\u2019s Inland Empire, touched patients\u2019 genitals for no medical reason. In 2016, the board handed him 35 months of administrative probation, requiring him, among other things, to have a chaperone when treating females.\n\nFakhoury did not admit to the allegations, according to his attorney, and criminal charges against him were dropped. If he successfully completes probation next year, he\u2019ll be able to practice without restriction.\n\nWith a mission of patient protection and doctor rehabilitation \u2014 not punishment \u2014 California\u2019s medical board and those in other states make decisions under laws and norms that can seem discordant in the #MeToo era.\n\nCalifornia is often cited as one of the more rigorous states in overseeing doctors. But, according to the medical board, very few sexual misconduct complaints are reported to the board in the first place, historically under 200 a year. Even fewer result in a formal accusation against a doctor. And when discipline is found to be warranted \u2014 typically in fewer than 20 cases a year \u2014 the board tends toward leniency, sometimes granting a few years of probation even in instances of severe misconduct, according to a KHN analysis of medical board records.\n\nMore than a third of doctors sanctioned by California\u2019s board in cases that alleged sexual misconduct received probation in the past 10 years \u2014 some more than once. The terms of probation \u2014 which is not a criminal court action but places conditions on a physician\u2019s license \u2014 often required temporary chaperones, as well as psychotherapy and courses in \u201cprofessional boundaries\u201d and ethics. (Through probation, the medical board can only place conditions or restrictions on a doctor\u2019s license in civil proceedings; it does not take criminal court actions.)\n\n\u201cThey love giving second chances\u201d to physicians, said Marian Hollingsworth of San Diego, a frequent critic of the California medical board. \u201cIt makes you wonder where their priorities are \u2026 Their first loyalty is supposed to be patient safety and that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nThe recent, shocking reports about years of abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar and University of Southern California gynecologist George Tyndall \u2014 as well as national expos\u00e9s about physician misconduct by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Associated Press \u2014have only intensified concerns about whether sexual abuse is taken seriously enough in medicine.\n\nNassar, accused of abuse by scores of girls and women under the guise of medical treatment, is now serving what amounts to a life sentence. Prosecutors are considering criminal charges against Tyndall in more than 50 cases, and the state medical board has suspended his license while seeking revocation. He has denied the allegations.\n\nAnd just last week, 17 women sued Columbia University and its affiliated hospitals, alleging that the facilities engaged in covering up decades of sexual abuse by one of its OB-GYNs.\n\nResearch has shown that many doctors who sexually exploit patients, like other perpetrators of abuse, don\u2019t stop with one victim. They \u201cperpetrate such behavior for years before being stopped,\u201d said the authors of one study.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, California Gov. Jerry Brown in September signed landmark patient protection legislation requiring doctors who are on probation for sexual and other serious misconduct to notify patients of their status and the terms under which they must practice. It will take effect next July. The bill had failed twice before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said the bill\u2019s lead author, Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo). \u201cThe #Me Too movement has really made it very clear that there are individuals even in the most respected professions who abuse their authority.\u201d\n\nEven as sexual abuse complaints filed with the medical board rose significantly in the past year to coincide with the rise of #MeToo, board officials say they plan no major changes in how the board dispenses discipline in sexual misconduct cases.\n\nThe #MeToo movement \u201chas not changed us,\u201d said the board\u2019s executive director, Kimberly Kirchmeyer. Cracking down on sexual misconduct has always been \u201cone of the board\u2019s top priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nDigging into the records\n\nKHN examined all 135 cases of alleged sexual abuse investigated by the board that resulted in sanctions from July 2008 through June 2018. (The analysis did not include discipline based on proceedings in other states.)\n\nMore than a third of sanctions were for sexual misconduct with more than one victim, and the vast majority of alleged perpetrators were men accused of exploiting women.\n\nDoctors\u2019 licenses were revoked in 39 cases and voluntarily surrendered in 38. Several doctors received public reprimands \u2014 a minor sanction.\n\nThe largest share of sanctions \u2014 49 cases, or more than a third \u2014 were for probation.\n\nAccording to the board\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, the minimum probation period is seven years for a doctor found to have engaged in sexual misconduct \u2014 whether it is a sexual relationship with a patient, sexualized touching during exams or inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nBut those \u201cminimums\u201d were not applied in more than half of the probation cases, according to the KHN analysis. The guidelines allow exceptions based on \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d the age of cases, the quality of evidence and other factors.\n\nKirchmeyer noted that the board treats every case as unique and places a high value on a doctor\u2019s remorse and acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nIn eight cases, KHN found, a doctor sanctioned for sexual misconduct had previously been sanctioned for similar misconduct.\n\nDr. Patrick Mark Sutton, a Pasadena obstetrician-gynecologist, received probation twice \u2014 the first time for four years after investigators alleged sexual misconduct in 2002. In 2011, he was placed on probation again \u2014 this time for three years \u2014 following allegations that he improperly rubbed a patient\u2019s thigh and engaged in inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nHe denied all sexual misconduct allegations in 2002 and 2011, admitting only to medical record-keeping violations in both cases.\n\nThis September, after he had completed mandated ethics and \u201cboundaries\u201d courses, the medical board filed a new accusation against Sutton, saying that he had called a patient \u201chairy\u201d and asked the patient, who was naked from the waist down under a drape and in stirrups exposing her genitals: \u201cDo you enjoy orgasms? You are a very beautiful woman,\u201d according to the documents. That case is pending.\n\nSutton\u2019s lawyer, Gary Wittenberg, said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe allegations in the pending accusation are untrue and we will prove that in court.\u201d\n\nIn several cases, the board granted probation knowing the doctor had been convicted of misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse investigations.\n\nFakhoury, the Inland Empire doctor, had faced felony sexual abuse-related charges but was not convicted due to a hung jury, according to San Bernardino County Superior Court records.\n\nHis lawyer, Courtney Pilchman, told Kaiser Health News that the criminal charges were dismissed afterward and that the doctor \u201cdid not stipulate\u201d to \u2014 or admit to \u2014 the medical board accusation.\n\nBy contrast, Ohio\u2019s medical board, upon learning of California\u2019s sanction, in 2012 revoked his state license.\n\nThe number of disciplinary actions taken over the decade is strikingly small given the size of California\u2019s practicing physician population of more than 100,000. Alleged victims of sexual abuse by physicians are significantly less likely to come forward than sexual abuse victims in general, some research indicates.\n\nHowever, numbers provided by the medical board suggest that many of the complaints that are filed \u2014 whether by victims themselves or other sources \u2014 do not result in formal accusations against doctors. From October 2013 through June 2018, 838 complaints were designated by the board as possible sexual misconduct. During that same period, 74 accusations were filed. (Multiple complaints could be filed about one doctor.)\n\nExperts and lawyers familiar with the board offered various explanations: Some complaints may be false. Doctor sexual misconduct can be hard to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as required in medical board cases. Accused physicians often hire experienced lawyers who aggressively fight back, leading to delays and deals. Victims may decline to testify or present poorly as witnesses.\n\nSome victims, for instance, have psychiatric disorders or believe that they were engaging in a \u201cconsensual\u201d relationship, according to medical board documents.\n\nBoard staff have worked hard to treat alleged victims sensitively, Kirchmeyer said. Expert reviewers are instructed to read complaints as if the person is telling the truth, she said, and the board plans weeklong training sessions to help investigators work better with alleged victims and prepare them for testifying.\n\nThe cases often drag on. It can take years for victims to come forward in the first place \u2014 and more time for cases to wind their way through the state\u2019s complex bureaucracy. Evidence can go stale.\n\n\u201cPhysicians have to have due process,\u201d Kirchmeyer said. \u201cAnyone can make a complaint about anyone at any time.\u201d\n\nHeidi de Marco/KHN Tracy Lystra at her home in Aguanga, Calif.\n\n\u2018Slap in my face\u2019\n\nFacing what they see as an uphill battle, lawyers from the state Department of Justice, who handle administrative hearings, will sometimes pre-emptively recommend probation \u2014 even in serious sexual misconduct accusations \u2014 to avoid the possibility a doctor will get no sanction at all from a judge, said Laura Sweet, a former deputy director who retired in 2015.\n\nSweet, who worked for the medical board for 23 years, said the legal process focuses on the doctors and does not always give sufficient weight to the pain of alleged victims. \u201cYou\u2019re sending a message that\u2019s potentially minimizing what the victim endured.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Tracy Lystra sees it, too. In 2013, Lystra sued her Fallbrook, California OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he harassed her with comments about her body and how she aroused him, whispering into her ear as she lay on a gurney before surgery that she looked like a \u201csexy librarian.\u201d She said the case, which also alleged medical negligence, was settled for $150,000 in 2016. Bianchi, who could not be reached for comment, denied the allegations in court documents.\n\nThrough her attorney, Lystra filed a complaint to the medical board shortly after settling with Bianchi. This past July, she received a letter from the board saying it would not be able \u201cestablish grounds for discipline\u201d against Bianchi in her case, \u201cconsidering all the evidence and mitigating factors.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she learned that the board had received complaints from other women.\n\nIn 2014, Bianchi had been put on five years\u2019 probation after the board accused him of making inappropriate sexual remarks to two patients, telling one he dreamed of having oral sex with her and couldn\u2019t stop staring at her breasts. After learning of these cases, another woman came forward, alleging Bianchi several years earlier had blocked his office door with a chair, inserted his fingers into her vagina, exposed his penis and asked her for sex.\n\nThe board\u2019s penalty was another five years\u2019 probation. But the two probation terms overlap \u2014 and Bianchi, who agreed not to contest the allegations as part of the settlements in each case, could go back to work as an OB-GYN without restrictions in 2021. In the meantime, he is not allowed to treat female patients.\n\nLearning that Bianchi received such a light punishment \u2014 and that the board would not take action on her own complaint \u2014 was crushing, Lystra said, noting that it had been so difficult to get anyone, including her family, to believe her.\n\n\u201cI really wanted him stopped. It was so disappointing when medical board responded the way it did,\u201d Lystra said.\u201cIt was a slap in my face.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nIn its analysis, KHN requested every sanction for sexual misconduct issued by the Medical Board of California over the past 10 years, the name of each doctor involved and his or her license number. The board responded with 181 actions against 175 doctors from fiscal year 2008-09, beginning in July, through fiscal year 2017-2018, ending in June. (The records were designated by the board as primarily for sexual misconduct but often included other allegations.)\n\nKHN used the board\u2019s document lookup search on its website to review its available public records on each doctor. KHN mentioned sanctions outside the 10-year period when records showed the doctors were repeat offenders.\n\nThe analysis excluded cases in which the board took action in response to sanctions issued by other states\u2019 medical boards for sexual misconduct outside California.\n\nFor each sanction, KHN determined the number of alleged victims identified in the board\u2019s accusations, their gender, type of sanction, length and terms of probation, type of alleged sexual misconduct and whether the board took note of any previous or concurrent criminal proceedings.\n\nKHN also requested the number of complaints the board received alleging sexual misconduct, and how many formal accusations the board filed each year after the allegations were investigated and merited disciplinary action. The board did not have data for all 10 years, but provided the number of complaints received and the number of accusations filed from October 2013 through the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "IVFML Season 2, Episode 10: Surviving Pregnancy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivfml-season-2-episode-10-surviving-pregnancy_us_5c1ada76e4b0407e9076db19", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:06", "body_paragraphs": "Leah De Shay has been pregnant nine times over the course of her life, but she has only three living children. De Shay has lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that makes every pregnancy more risky for both her and the fetus.\n\n\u201cI was told that there was a high likelihood I would never have kids in the first place,\u201d De Shay said. \u201cBut my understanding of that, and the way it was communicated to me, was because my body wasn\u2019t going to get pregnant, not because my body was going to get pregnant and then try to kill me or the babies in the process.\u201d\n\nDe Shay also struggles to find high-quality, low-cost health insurance. She\u2019s one of the almost 9 million Americans who buy insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace every year. And as funding for the marketplace and federal subsidies continue to shrink, so too do her choices.\n\nDe Shay has no guarantee that the plan she purchases will still exist a year later, or stay the same price, when the next enrollment session begins. For instance, in 2017, one insurer canceled her policy after it claimed she didn\u2019t pay the premium \u2015 something De Shay disputes. Once the bill got sorted out, she was advised to move to a different plan altogether because the original one wouldn\u2019t be available the next year.\n\nOne University of Michigan study in 2015 found that more than half of marketplace buyers in Michigan that year had switched plans since 2014, either leaving the market, becoming uninsured or picking a different plan on the marketplace.\n\nOver the past decade, she estimates she\u2019s been on nine different insurance plans. This churn impedes her from managing her lupus with a long-term doctor that she trusts, and it makes it more difficult to obtain specialized prenatal care when she is pregnant.\n\nOn this episode of IVFML, we look at infertility that is exacerbated by manmade policies \u2015 not just a result of our bodies, but of the health care system we live with.\n\nListen to Episode 10 of \u2018IVFML Becoming Family\u2019 below.\n\nIn addition to learning about De Shay\u2019s personal story, we spoke to HuffPost senior writer Jonathan Cohn, who\u2019s an expert on health insurance coverage in the U.S. Cohn said that constantly churning through insurance plans makes chronic conditions like lupus even more difficult to manage, which in turn harms health.\n\nCohn said that the best way to deliver high-quality health care is to have continuity \u2015 the same primary doctor who sees you every year, coordinates specialist care and keeps tabs on your overall health. But switching plans every year also means switching provider networks, and that means you\u2019re likely to be restricted to a new group of doctors every single time.\n\n\u201cSo you get these situations where the physicians you\u2019re seeing don\u2019t know your history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to get tests taken over and over again, because the records from the last one didn\u2019t make it over to the new hospital you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nFor example, over the course of her adult life, De Shay had learned to recognize the signs of an impending pregnancy loss. First, her lupus symptoms would begin to intensify. Sometimes her hair would fall out, one side of her body would swell or become numb and she would faint. Then, the bleeding would start.\n\nAnd because she had learned to recognize the signs so well, dealing with new sets of doctors and health care providers for every single pregnancy who didn\u2019t know her history, and didn\u2019t know her as a person, became incredibly frustrating.\n\n\u201cAnd at no point does anybody even acknowledge what has really happened to you, much less the part that they played in it,\u201d she said about her losses, which she feels could have been avoided.\n\nDe Shay, who is black, suspected that her race may have played a role in the way her health care was mismanaged.\n\nIt\u2019s a concern familiar to ProPublica reporter Nina Martin, who interviewed hundreds of mothers and families for her 2017 project \u201cLost Mothers,\u201d an in-depth look at the rising maternal mortality rate in the U.S. \u2014 which is driven mostly by black women.\n\nMartin tells us in this episode that one of the most pressing refrains she kept hearing from the women was that their near-death experience wasn\u2019t their fault \u2015 and that they had told health care providers early and often about their symptoms.\n\n\u201cThey knew something was wrong, and they would tell their doctors, they would tell their nurses, they would try to tell people there is something the matter with me,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAnd people would say, no, no, no, you\u2019re wrong, this is just what it\u2019s like to be pregnant. This is what it\u2019s like to have a baby. There\u2019s nothing the matter with you.\u201d\n\nDuring De Shay\u2019s last pregnancy, she had to be hospitalized in the final trimester because of a lupus flare-up, and then she switched to a second hospital because her health insurance policy demanded it. She feels this final switch unnecessarily complicated her lupus, pregnancy and birth \u2015 and that the poor relationships she had with her new doctors almost cost her life."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "You Can\u2019t Understand The Brutal Reality Of Gun Violence Until You Hear It From Doctors", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-gun-violence-this-is-our-lane_us_5c1c1203e4b08aaf7a86a67b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:06", "body_paragraphs": "Christmas Eve, for Dr. Mary Brandt, will forever be associated with saving the life of a little girl who nearly died from a gunshot more than 25 years ago.\n\nTeams were in the middle of changing shifts when a 6-year-old came to a Texas county hospital ER with massive gunshot wounds to her shoulder and chest. Her mother had been fatally shot by her boyfriend. When the girl tried to call 911, the man turned his shotgun on her.\n\nAfter hours of surgery, Brandt saved the child. Since then, Brandt, now a pediatric surgeon at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston, has operated on many more child shooting victims. \u201cAll of us have some patients who we can\u2019t forget,\u201d Brandt said of the young girl. \u201cIn terms of being able to not be sad about it, it took months and months. I\u2019m still probably a little sad about it.\u201d\n\nFew people in the world are more familiar with gun violence than emergency room doctors and surgeons like Brandt. But until recently they\u2019ve largely kept quiet about their experiences on the front line of this public health crisis.\n\nThat changed in November after the American College of Physicians issued new guidelines on how doctors can help protect patients from gun violence \u2015 and the National Rifle Association responded by telling physicians to \u201cstay in your lane.\u201d\n\nIn effect, the NRA wanted these doctors to shut up about an issue that touches their lives daily, leading to a record high of nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and around twice as many injuries each year.\n\nThe NRA retort was enough to lead many physicians to break their silence. Under the banner of \u201cThis is our lane,\u201d surgeons and other doctors thrust themselves into the gun debate, sharing photos from inside operating rooms and telling stories about the agony of treating an unending flow of shooting victims.\n\nMedical organizations also doubled down, calling for additional gun violence research and further pushing measures like universal background checks, waiting periods to buy guns, safe storage initiatives and so-called red flag laws designed to keep firearms away from people who may be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nNow, in a series of interviews with HuffPost, doctors are shedding additional light on the topic, painting a diverse portrait of a problem that afflicts communities in a variety of forms, including mass shootings, assaults, accidents, intimate partner violence and suicide.\n\nTheir accounts describe exhausting work that doctors have traditionally shouldered in private. Many doctors told HuffPost they feel it\u2019s their moral duty to show the public the truth: Gun violence is ubiquitous in emergency rooms all over the country.\n\nExposing people to that reality could resonate in a way that general facts and figures about gun violence haven\u2019t and show Americans that it\u2019s necessary to begin taking steps to address the crisis, Brandt said.\n\n\u201cHuman beings don\u2019t just change their minds because of data.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something I wish I could do something about, but I feel helpless. Dr. Adam Schechner, University of Maryland Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center\n\nWhen doctors see patients with gunshot wounds on a daily basis, it\u2019s hard to keep track of how many they\u2019ve treated.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew. Too many,\u201d said Dr. Adam Schechner, a trauma surgeon at the University of Maryland Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center in Cheverly.\n\nSchechner estimates he\u2019s tended to hundreds of shooting victims, the majority of them young men from Washington and the Maryland suburb of Prince George\u2019s County. Schechner recalled a case in which a young man died of his injuries. When Schechner informed the patient\u2019s mother, she broke down. The woman gathered herself long enough to explain that the son she\u2019d lost was the only family she had left. Her other son had been shot and killed a few years prior. She was alone.\n\n\u201cThat one really, really got to me,\u201d Schechner said.\n\nEven when his patients survive, it can feel as if he\u2019s working against a tide that will ultimately erase his work, Schechner said. Many of the gunshot victims that come into the hospital have been shot before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening because most of the time it seems like they just don\u2019t care, [like] they don\u2019t seem to appreciate the second chance they\u2019ve been given,\u201d Schechner said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the hardest part of my job: working to save somebody\u2019s life and then having them not appreciate that life.\u201d\n\nLast year, the hospital Schechner works at launched a program to help survivors who\u2019ve been shot or stabbed multiple times, providing wraparound care and social services designed to target the root causes of violence. The evidence so far suggests it\u2019s working.\n\nThe program is a critical step toward prevention, but it\u2019s hardly a catchall solution to gun violence, Schechner said. The more shooting victims he treats, the more he realizes this issue affects him not just as a doctor but also as the father of young children, who he fears he could someday find on an operating table with a gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cIt makes my life outside the hospital that much sadder, because it\u2019s something I wish I could do something about, but I feel helpless,\u201d Schechner said.\n\nIt was like a scene from hell. Dr. John Fildes, University Medical Center of Southern Nevada\n\nEven two decades as a trauma surgeon couldn\u2019t truly prepare Dr. John Fildes for the terror he encountered on Oct. 1, 2017.\n\nFildes began his shift at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas just minutes after the gunfire stopped at the Route 91 music festival, the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. There were already 35 people with gunshot wounds waiting in the trauma area, he said.\n\n\u201cThere was blood all over the floors and the gurneys, and there were patients that were holding pressure on their own wounds telling me to take care of the sicker patients,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cIt was like a scene from hell.\u201d\n\nFildes and his colleagues scrambled to get the most severely injured patients into the operating room and worked to stabilize the others. Most of the team managed to work through the paralyzing horror of the moment, though a handful of staffers were so emotionally jarred that they had to be briefly pulled away to compose themselves, Fildes said.\n\nDespite the circumstances, Fildes and the surgery department he chairs saved every one of the 104 patients connected to the shooting who arrived at the hospital alive.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Mourners gather at a makeshift memorial after the Route 91 shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nAny sense of triumph was short-lived, Fildes said. He still struggles to find words to describe what transpired that night.\n\n\u201cThis was 1,100 rounds of military-grade ammunition showered on 22,000 people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another one of these cases.\u201d\n\nAlthough the medical center began interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder the next day, in the year since the shooting, staffers have reported sleeplessness and repeated nightmares, Fildes said. A handful have required more serious care.\n\nThe Route 91 Harvest festival shooting was a horrific outlier, and Fildes said he hopes no surgeon will have to witness another massacre of this scale. But even doctors lucky enough to avoid mass shootings can\u2019t escape the constant drumbeat of more ordinary firearm injuries and deaths, he said. For many, that bloodshed is reason enough to speak out on gun violence.\n\n\u201cDoctors don\u2019t have a gun problem; they have a bullet hole problem,\u201d Fildes said, adding that a renewed focus on firearm safety, prevention and enforcing existing gun laws would go a long way toward saving lives.\n\nThere\u2019s only one degree of separation between you and everybody else. Dr. Christopher Barsotti, Berkshire Medical Center and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center\n\nWhen Dr. Christopher Barsotti, an emergency physician, moved to southern Vermont from a busy Chicago hospital known for treating shooting victims, he hoped he\u2019d be leaving gun violence behind. Instead, it became more personal.\n\nBarsotti sometimes recognizes patients he treats in the emergency room, or has at least met their family members or neighbors, he said. That can make cases even harder as he learns about the often tragic circumstances that precede shootings.\n\nBeyond self-inflicted gunshot wounds and instances of people \u201csettling scores,\u201d rural hospitals see plenty of hunting accidents, domestic violence or shootings involving children who\u2019ve accessed unsecured firearms, said Barsotti, who is a gun owner himself. In the worst cases, it may fall to Barsotti to deliver bad news to a person he knows.\n\n\u201cWhen you live out here, there\u2019s like 2 degrees separation between you and everybody else,\u201d Barsotti said. \u201cWhen you are actually working and taking care of people, there\u2019s only 1 degree of separation.\u201d\n\nSometimes the unthinkable happens. Dr. Richard Miskimins, a trauma surgeon at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, recalled operating on a patient who\u2019d been shot in the face. Hours later, he found out he knew the man.\n\n\u201cHe was so horribly disfigured that I didn\u2019t realize,\u201d Miskimins said.\n\nAlbuquerque is hardly a rural town, but as home to the state\u2019s only Level I trauma center, Miskimins and his colleagues treat a number of patients transferred from smaller counties in the state. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds are particularly common, Miskimins said. Although the vast majority of people who attempt to kill themselves with a firearm will die, those who don\u2019t are typically left with debilitating neurological or physical injuries that require intensive care.\n\nA few years ago, Miskimins treated a patient who\u2019d intentionally shot himself. After completing a lengthy recovery, including a facial reconstruction, the young man began visiting the ICU regularly to thank the staff, said Miskimins. The patient has since gotten involved in national suicide prevention efforts.\n\n\u201cSuicide is so often just an impulsive thing, where, in the depths of despair, they act,\u201d he said, citing studies showing that many people who survive suicide attempts don\u2019t go on to try again. When a gun is available, those impulses are far more likely to end in death.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the person who sustains the injury. Dr. Richard Miskimins, University of New Mexico Hospital\n\nGun violence isn\u2019t just a story of victims and perpetrators, Miskimins said. Whether fatal or not, every shooting ripples outward, touching not only the individuals directly involved but also their families, friends and loved ones, as well as the medical professionals who serve as intermediaries during these painful ordeals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the person who sustains the injury that has a significant psychological impact on them; it\u2019s also on their family that comes and sees them,\u201d Miskimins said.\n\nAs challenging as it can be for everyone to recover after a shooting, it pales in comparison to the alternative. Telling a parent that their child has been fatally shot never gets easier, said Dr. Mark Seamon, a trauma surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine. He said he changes into clean scrubs and takes a few deep breaths before giving the news.\n\n\u201cYou never know what their reaction will be,\u201d Seamon said. \u201cI\u2019ve had reactions where the mother would say, \u2018Well, we knew this was coming,\u2019 and just walk out.\u201d\n\nSo, a lot of folks have asked me about this photo: the chair. Why? Well, I have a chair for all the things I ROUTINELY do: my dinner chair, my reading chair, the chair where I rock my kids to sleep. And the chair where I tell parents their kids are dead. #ThisisOurLane pic.twitter.com/MNDutybXwC \u2014 Stephanie Bonne (@scrubbedin) November 17, 2018\n\nEven when a family fears the worst, they\u2019re never really prepared for it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain tenor, there\u2019s a certain pitch to their voices or the cry that they give when you tell them that their loved one has died,\u201d Barsotti said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound that hits you in the pit of your stomach.\u201d\n\nThe day you don\u2019t cry is the day you should quit. Dr. Mary Brandt, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital\n\nThe emotional burden of gun violence weighed heavily on the mind of every doctor HuffPost spoke with. When asked how they deal with it, there was less agreement.\n\nSome emergency rooms do their best to address grief in real time. When someone dies in the trauma bay at the University of New Mexico Hospital, they\u2019ll hold a brief moment of silence to reflect on the loss and acknowledge the staff, said Dr. Stephen Lu, a trauma surgeon.\n\n\u201cIt takes like 30 seconds, then we go on with the rest of the night,\u201d Lu said.\n\nTo handle the stress of a life-or-death job in the operating room, many doctors said they must be able to compartmentalize. For some, that may mean simply trying to bury the brutal reality of what they\u2019ve witnessed.\n\nSchechner, the doctor from Maryland, rarely talks about how his job affects him personally, he said, noting that surgeons are generally wary of showing any sign of weakness related to their work.\n\n\u201cEvery person that I pronounce dead from a gunshot wound takes a little piece of me,\u201d Schechner said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019re human, too, and we\u2019re not supposed to act like it.\u201d\n\nDespite perceptions of physicians as being unshakable, or even stolid, those qualities are just one part of the job, said Brandt, the pediatric surgeon from Texas. The other half involves being human. In the operating room, surgeons must focus on saving lives. \u201cAfterwards, we allow it to hit us,\u201d Brandt explained. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve always felt, and I have taught, is the day you don\u2019t cry is the day you should quit.\u201d\n\nTo the @NRA, this is what it looks like to stay in #mylane. We will not be silent about the toll of #gunviolence. I speak out for this patient, for their parents who will never be the same, for every person who came after this one and didn\u2019t have to #thisiseveryoneslane pic.twitter.com/B5mo6pC4dV \u2014 Kristin Gee, MD (@kmgee9) November 10, 2018\n\nDoctors manage these emotions with varying degrees of success. Traditionally, the medical profession has viewed self-care as selfish, maintaining that a physician\u2019s own needs are secondary to the patient\u2019s, said Dr. Jo Shapiro, director of the Center for Professionalism and Peer Support at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter three decades of practicing surgery, Shapiro was struck by the lack of attention paid to the people doing the work. It eventually became clear that physicians couldn\u2019t continue putting themselves last. Studies have shown that burnout, depression and other mental health problems plague the health care profession. And the doctors HuffPost spoke to were quick to note that the cascading effects of gun violence don\u2019t stop at physicians. They can touch everyone from nurses, to hospital support staff, to the custodians who clean blood off the floor of the ER.\n\nShapiro now directs a program that trains physicians how to support each other when they experience trauma on the job, whether it\u2019s an acute response to a particular case or the cumulative weight of unceasing gun violence.\n\n\u201cSomebody has to be there to help patients who have been shot, but it\u2019s very frustrating, saddening [and] hard to do over and over again,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt can be demoralizing.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019ve had someone die in your hands, that\u2019s easy to say. Dr. Stephen Lu, University of New Mexico Hospital\n\nSome doctors see the \u201cThis is our lane\u201d movement as an outlet not only to begin processing their grief but also to channel it toward solutions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such joy in thinking I\u2019m not just treating the end result, I\u2019m helping prevent this,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201d[It\u2019s] letting us bring our humanity back into our work.\u201d\n\nThis focus on prevention is also well-trod in the field of medicine, with doctors using similar methods to tackle past public health crises, such as HIV, smoking, motor vehicle deaths or environmental hazards and pollution.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Makes Surprise Visit to American Troops in Iraq", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-visit.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:08", "body_paragraphs": "But on Wednesday, about 100 American servicemen and women, some of whom were wearing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps, greeted Mr. Trump with a standing ovation in Al Asad Air Base\u2019s dining facility, which had been decorated for Christmas. He and Mrs. Trump spent about 15 minutes there talking with the troops.\n\nThe president told reporters that he had chosen Iraq for his first visit to a combat zone because \u201cit\u2019s a place that I\u2019ve been talking about for many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd many, many years, before it started, I was talking about it, as a civilian,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump, who left the White House late Christmas night, said he had harbored some safety concerns about the trip.\n\n\u201cI had concerns for the institution of the presidency because \u2014 not for myself, personally,\u201d he said. \u201cI had concerns for the first lady, I will tell you.

While the number of casualties in these conflicts is a fraction of what it was during the two previous administrations, the fact that American troops are still on the ground \u2014 in the case of Afghanistan, 17 years after they were first deployed \u2014 attests to the difficulty of extracting the United States from these entanglements.\n\nMr. Trump, who was also accompanied to Iraq by his national security adviser, John R.

An associate of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s said that his total grant to American Engagement was $750,000, which also went toward other political races and social media research. Mr. Dickerson has declined to comment.\n\nAmerican Engagement then passed $100,000 to Mr. Morgan and other researchers. Mr. Hoffman\u2019s statement says the money went to Mr. Morgan\u2019s company, New Knowledge, but Mr. Morgan said the Alabama project was carried out separately from the company.\n\nThe revelations of and fallout from the operation are being closely watched. Some American political experts fear that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 could become a dangerous model for stateside politics, with dirty tricks on social media becoming common. Laws and regulations have not been updated to cope with such a threat.\n\nOn Saturday, Facebook shut down five accounts, belonging to Mr. Morgan and other unnamed individuals, in response to their use of \u201cinauthentic\u201d operations on the platform. Twitter declined to say whether it had taken any action in the Alabama case.\n\nSenator Jones and Democratic Party officials have said they were unaware of the social media tactics and denounced them. Mr. Jones has called for investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission \u2014 a call Mr. Hoffman joined on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe cannot permit dishonest campaign tactics to go unchecked in our democracy \u2014 no matter which side they purportedly help,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said in his statement."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Trump in Iraq: First Visit to U.S. Troops in Combat", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000006280393/trump-iraq-troops-video.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:13", "body_paragraphs": "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The President Be Impeached?\u2019 We Answer Your Questions"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: Marburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/health/marburg-virus-fruit-bats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:13", "body_paragraphs": "The Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, has been isolated in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the first time it has been found in West Africa.\n\nFive bats caught in three health districts tested positive for the virus, according to two teams of scientists.

A vaccine is now available, and experimental treatments appear to be helping to save lives. With international help, Congo was able to quickly snuff out an earlier outbreak in its \u00c9quateur Province this year.\n\nYet eastern Congo, teeming with no fewer than 100 armed groups, has been gripped by near-constant conflict since the uprising that led to its independence in 1960, as well as the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda and the civil war soon after that eventually established the regime of Joseph Kabila.\n\nMillions are thought to have died from the chronic violence, many of them at the hands of government forces. The insecurity is frustrating efforts to combat this latest Ebola outbreak \u2014 now the second largest in history, after one that tore through West Africa from 2014 to 2016, claiming 11,310 lives \u2014 making the current crisis almost entirely manufactured.\n\nEbola still kills most of the people who contract it. Since the outbreak here was declared in August, health officials have recorded 583 confirmed and suspected cases as of Dec. 25.

The United States Navy recently traded an 18-hour submarine shift schedule for a 24-hour one that more closely matches sailors\u2019 biological rhythms. And at some pharmaceutical, software and financial companies, managers expect employees to come to the office for only a few hours in the middle of the day \u2014 or to work off site entirely.\n\n\u201cI think circadian rhythms will be a huge issue for human resources in the future,\u201d said Camilla Kring, a Danish consultant who has helped employees at AbbVie, Roche, Medtronic and other companies learn to respect their natural sleep cycles. \u201cIt really makes sense to think about when people have the most energy and when they\u2019re peaking mentally.\u201d\n\nWorker fatigue has played a role in many workplace accidents, most famously the Challenger space shuttle explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but no doubt countless more on the commute to and from work. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy drivers cause 16.5 percent of fatal crashes.\n\nA survey released last year by the National Safety Council found that 97 percent of workers have at least one risk factor for fatigue, with 27 percent reporting having unintentionally fallen asleep on the job in the previous month and 16 percent that they had experienced at least one safety incident because of fatigue.\n\n\u201cWe have a 24/7 society, so we knew fatigue was definitely affecting part of our work force,\u201d said Emily Whitcomb, senior program manager of the council\u2019s fatigue initiative. \u201cBut we did not anticipate that fatigue was going to be affecting almost 100 percent of our work force.\u201d\n\nSleep deprivation may even lead to ethical breaches at work. In a 2014 experiment, Christopher Barnes of the University of Washington and colleagues asked 142 people with extreme chronotypes to show up at their laboratory either at 7 a.m. or at midnight for a dice-rolling game that offered a $500 prize. Reporting was on the honor system. Morning people lied 18 percent more when they did the task at midnight than when they did it in the morning, whereas night owls lied 16 percent more when doing the task at 7 a.m.\n\nDr. Roenneberg has collected data from 300,000 people and found that chronotypes plot as a bell-shaped curve, with a few individuals at each extreme and most falling somewhere in the middle. According to Dr. Roenneberg\u2019s research, the most frequent chronotype \u2014 held by about 13 percent of the population \u2014 sleeps from around midnight to 8 a.m. Thirty-one percent of people have an earlier natural bedtime, and 56 percent have a later one. That means for at least 69 percent of the population, getting to the office by 8 or 9 a.m. requires waking up before their body is ready."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Take a Number: Long-Acting Contraceptives Gaining Acceptance Among U.S. Women", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/health/women-contraceptives.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-27 09:02:14", "body_paragraphs": "Almost two-thirds of women of childbearing age in the United States use contraceptives, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlmost all American women turn to contraception at some point in their lives.

After all, HDL, for high-density lipoprotein, acts like an arterial cleanser, removing cholesterol from blood vessels and preparing it for removal outside the body.\n\nAn ample supply of HDL cholesterol in blood serum has long been linked to protection against coronary heart disease and stroke, so what could be bad?\n\nI now know that, as with many other good things in life, there can be too much of this usually helpful protein. The best available evidence has shown that most of us would probably be best off aiming for moderation with regard to serum levels of HDL.\n\nA series of studies, large and small, in this country and abroad shows that the relationship of HDL levels to heart disease and overall mortality forms a U-shaped curve: too little and too much of this blood lipid are, on average, associated with an elevated risk of heart disease, cancer and premature death."}]
