It has also created new controversies, with legal experts debating about the legality of the appointment and news stories featuring his past criticisms of Mueller and defense of Trump.\n\nThe transformation of Sessions from influential early backer of Trump's improbable presidential campaign to frequent target of the President's scorn is a study in the fickleness of political alliances in Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, the attorney general received the call everyone in Washington knew was coming some day soon.\n\nJohn Kelly, the White House chief of staff, asked Sessions to submit his resignation, according to multiple sources briefed on the call. Sessions agreed to comply, but he wanted a few more days before the resignation would become effective. Kelly said he'd consult the President.\n\nSoon, the sources say, top Justice officials convened on the 5th floor suite of offices for the attorney general. Eventually, there were two huddles in separate offices. Among those in Sessions' office was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, his deputy Ed O'Callaghan, Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Steven Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nA few yards away, Whitaker strategized with other aides, including Gary Barnett, now his chief of staff.\n\nThe rival huddles, which haven't been previously reported, laid bare a break in the relationship between Sessions and Whitaker that had emerged in recent weeks, after it became clear that Whitaker played a behind-the-scenes role in an aborted effort to oust Rosenstein.\n\nA source close to Sessions says that the former attorney general realized that Whitaker was \"self-dealing\" after reports surfaced in September that Whitaker had spoken with Kelly and had discussed plans to become the No. 2 at the Justice Department if Rosenstein was forced to resign.\n\nIn recent months, with his relationship with the President at a new low, Sessions skipped several so-called principals meetings that he was slated to attend as a key member of the Cabinet. A source close to Sessions says that neither the attorney general nor Trump thought it was a good idea for Sessions to be at the White House, so he sent surrogates. Whitaker was one of them.\n\nBut Sessions did not realize Whitaker was having conversations with the White House about his future until the news broke in late September about Rosenstein.\n\nOn Wednesday as aides began drafting Sessions' resignation letter, the distrust for Whitaker burst into the open.\n\nThe fact that Whitaker would become acting attorney general, passing over Rosenstein suddenly raised concerns about the impact on the most high-profile investigation in the Justice Department, the Russia probe led by Mueller. The Mueller probe has been at the center of Trump's ire directed at Sessions and the Justice Department. Whitaker has made comments criticizing Mueller's investigation and Rosenstein's oversight of it, and has questioned the allegations of Russian interference.\n\nRosenstein and O'Callaghan, the highest-ranked officials handling day-to-day oversight of Mueller's investigation, urged Sessions to delay the effective date of his resignation.\n\nSoon, Whitaker strode into Sessions' office and asked to speak one-on-one to the attorney general; the others left the two men alone. It was a brief conversation. Shortly after, Sessions told his huddle that his resignation would be effective that day.\n\nO'Callaghan had tried to appeal to Sessions, noting that he hadn't heard back about whether the President would allow a delay. At least one Justice official in the room mentioned that there would be legal questions about whether Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general is constitutional. Someone also reminded Sessions that the last time Whitaker played a role in a purported resignation -- a few weeks earlier in September, with Rosenstein -- the plan collapsed.\n\nSessions never heard in person from the President -- the man who gained television fame for his catch-phrase \"You're fired\" doesn't actually like such confrontation and prefers to have others do the firing, people close to the President say. Kelly called Sessions a second time to tell him the President had rejected his request for a delay.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nJUST WATCHED Despite denial, Trump said last month he knows Whitaker Replay More Videos ...

Sessions interviewed him and the two grew to have a good working relationship. Sessions liked him, but even if he didn't, the plan was already hatched for him to take the role, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nLeonard Leo, the influential executive vice president of the Federalist Society, recommended to then-White House counsel Don McGahn that Whitaker would make a good chief of staff for Sessions.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo said Friday.\n\n\"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department,\" he added. \"Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager. He's a no-nonsense, get-it-done kind of guy.\"\n\nWhitaker, a 49-year-old former U.S. attorney from Iowa and former CNN contributor, is a gregarious imposing presence that fits his former life as college football tight end. His Twitter feed, which he made private in recent days, shows a picture of him weightlifting, a passion he complains he doesn't get as much time to enjoy these days.\n\nOn Thursday, his first full day as acting attorney general, and with criticism of his appointment beginning to swirl, he tried to exude a calm demeanor. He convened a late afternoon meeting with senior department officials. He kept remarks brief, saying he was proud to lead them, that they've been doing good work and to keep doing what they're doing. Another call, also brief, with US attorneys around the country followed.\n\nOn Friday, he sent his first department-wide message, thanking Sessions for his service and extolling the work of colleagues around the country. \"As we move forward, I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" Whitaker wrote.\n\nSessions' last day\n\nThe ignominious end to Sessions' tenure is a far cry from the early days of the 2016 campaign, when he became an eager surrogate. Sessions' hardline views on immigration became suffused in the rhetoric that Trump adopted.\n\nSessions was the first US senator to endorse Trump at a time when establishment Republicans were still staying away, and he left his safe Alabama Senate seat to take the attorney general job.\n\nSeveral members of his staff also joined the President's team, helping to craft some of the harsh immigration policies that Sessions often preached from Capitol Hill and which have become a cornerstone of stump speeches that Trump regularly uses to excite his political base.\n\nBut months into the job, Trump had soured on Sessions for the sin of recusing himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible connections to the Trump campaign.\n\nMore recently, Sessions appeared at peace with the prospect of being ousted from office. He made a series of valedictory visits with law enforcement around the country, seeking to underline what he believes will be his legacy of strong support for law enforcement and efforts to reduce crime.\n\nSessions spent Election Day on Tuesday surrounded by what he loves: cops and sweets.\n\nHe visited the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where officials warmly greeted him and provided a briefing on their latest capabilities.\n\nOver a plate of Milano cookies, he was an engaged questioner asking a scientist about DNA identification and how it has affected guilty pleas in court.\n\nLater, when he arrived in the cafeteria for lunch, a room full of FBI personnel and local police officers training in the National Academy rose to their feet as he entered the room. He went around from table to table, shaking hands, posing for pictures -- soaking up the moment and capping it off with vanilla ice cream with sprinkles.\n\nRoughly 24 hours later, he was out of a job."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump downplays his ties to Whitaker after criticism", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/MOyUcRPm1yg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:48", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from the Justice Department official he just named as acting attorney general in the face of mounting criticism about the legality and propriety of his appointment.\n\n\"I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said of the new acting attorney general, saying he hired him because he had worked for since-dismissed Attorney General Jeff Sessions . \"He was always extremely highly thought of, and he still is. But I didn't know Matt Whitaker. He worked for Attorney General Sessions.\"\n\nThe President's comments are at odds with the relationship Trump has forged with Whitaker in recent months, even as his opinion of Sessions continued to sour. Whitaker has been at the White House dozens of times, including in meetings with Trump, and the two have spoken by phone on several occasions, including on the day that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was expected to be fired.\n\nAnd in an October 11 interview on Fox News, Trump made clear he did, in fact, know Whitaker well.\n\n\"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker,\" he said.\n\nWhitaker was not hired as Sessions' chief of staff by virtue of any pre-existing relationship with Sessions, but instead because White House officials believed Whitaker's loyalties would lie at the White House and not with the beleaguered attorney general, sources said.\n\nAnd over the last year, Whitaker has told friends about his growing relationship with Trump. The President knew that he had played football and the tall, brawny former US attorney fit the image Trump liked, according to people familiar with their conversations, far more than the diminutive Sessions, whom Trump mocked.\n\n\"He looks like the kind of guy who sits at the head of a table,\" a source familiar with the matter said of Whitaker.\n\nQuestions arise\n\nEven as he claimed on Friday not to know Whitaker, it was clear Trump maintained an affinity for him, praising his qualifications for the job as he insisted Whitaker was being unfairly maligned.\n\nSome legal scholars -- including George Conway , the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- said they thought Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. Other critics have slammed Trump's decision to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because the move puts Whitaker in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which Whitaker had been publicly critical of.\n\nTrump insisted Friday that he had not spoken with Whitaker about the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker about it. I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President's move to distance himself from Whitaker is a familiar refrain Trump has used when associates of his have become embroiled in controversy.\n\nWhen federal prosecutors targeted his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen, Trump insisted Cohen handled only a \"tiny, tiny fraction\" of his legal work. Before that, he claimed that his indicted former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked for him for \"a very short period of time.\" And shortly before ousting his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who also helmed his campaign, Trump maintained Bannon \"came on very late.\"\n\nStill, the President praised Whitaker as \"very highly thought of\" and said that Whitaker is only taking heat because \"anybody that works for me, they do a number on him.\"\n\n\"Matt Whitaker is a very smart man, he is a very respected man in the law enforcement community, top of the line,\" Trump said. \"He's acting, I think he'll do a very good job and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nIn an email to Department of Justice staff on Friday, Whitaker vowed to lead \"a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\"\n\nSense of concern\n\nJUST WATCHED Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company 03:05\n\nTrump's comments came as a growing sense of concern developed inside the White House over the negative reaction to Whitaker being tapped as the acting chief law enforcement official. Several senior officials said they were surprised by the criticism and believe it could potentially jeopardize his chances to remain in the post if it continues to dominate headlines.\n\nIt was not widely known among the staff that he had commented repeatedly on the special counsel's investigation in interviews and on television -- an irony given that Whitaker's TV appearances helped him land his job at the Justice Department and people close to Trump encouraged Whitaker to keep up his TV appearances to draw Trump's attention.\n\nWhitaker was tapped by the White House to serve as Sessions' chief of staff in September 2017, with sources describing then-White House counsel Don McGahn as the person behind the hiring.\n\nMcGahn was drawn to Whitaker because he had a stalwart reputation in right-wing legal circles and because the White House wanted someone who was competent, could mind Sessions and could \"keep things on the rails\" at the Justice Department.\n\nLeonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, said he recommended Whitaker for that post.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo told CNN. \"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department. Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager. He's a no-nonsense, get-it-done kind of guy.\"\n\nWhitaker and White House chief of staff John Kelly developed a close relationship too. Kelly would often call Whitaker to convey when Trump was unhappy with something at the Justice Department or with Sessions in particular, and another source said Kelly and Whitaker were \"cut from the same cloth.\"\n\nWhitaker also worked to forge a relationship with the President's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner during trips to the White House, understanding they were key to moving up in Trump's eyes.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who is a Sessions ally and familiar with his senior staff, described Whitaker as a \"good lawyer\" with \"good political skills and instincts\" and said he had grown close to the White House.\n\nTerwilliger said Whitaker's position had put him in contact with the White House \"where he's held in pretty high regard.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Rosenstein calls Whitaker a 'superb' choice for acting AG", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/yJ3t06tuBLg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:48", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Friday hailed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker as a \"superb\" choice to fill the role even as Whitaker's past statements have prompted questions about his impartiality toward special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"I think he's a superb choice for attorney general,\" Rosenstein told a small group of reporters gathered outside of an investiture ceremony for US Attorney Zachary Terwilliger in Alexandria, Virginia. \"He certainly understands the work, understands the priorities of the department.\"\n\nThe positive tone from the No. 2 official at the Justice Department was notable, as Rosenstein and Whitaker have had a complicated relationship for some time, compounded by the fact that Whitaker had discussed taking Rosenstein's job with President Donald Trump several weeks ago. Despite that, Rosenstein, who has weathered the President's bad side at times and attacks from some of Trump's most vocal Hill allies, has managed to survive, and he publicly praised Whitaker on Friday in a clear attempt at displaying department solidarity.\n\nWhitaker, who previously served as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was vaulted to the position of acting attorney general on Wednesday after Trump fired Sessions.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "UK minister quits and calls for new Brexit vote", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/YGjbmDwHm_0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:49", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) Theresa May has lost another Johnson over Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson noisily quit as UK Foreign Secretary in July over the Prime Minister's plans to leave the European Union.

Like presidents before him, he will use the trip to escape an unpleasant election outcome that could salt the remaining two years of his term with investigations, subpoenas and gridlock.\n\nForeign policy remains an area Trump has a mostly free hand to do with as he pleases, without requiring signoff from a soon-to-be divided Congress. His predecessors also flew off on foreign trips after midterm drubbings, using the world spotlight as a reminder of their relevance and stature.\n\nTrump has been scrambling since Democrats won control of the House on Tuesday to distract from the results and paint forward momentum. The power shuffle in Washington swept out Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who was asked to resign on Wednesday. Battles with the media and an executive action on immigration followed.\n\nAs he departed Friday for what he termed a \"beautiful trip,\" Trump continued to vent about the Russia investigation and new criticism from former first lady Michelle Obama in a forthcoming memoir.\n\nAir Force One, though, is an ultimate refuge, able to place literal miles between the President and the bad news.\n\nThe President confirmed his attendance at the centenary event after determining in August that the $90 million price tag for the military parade he had commissioned in Washington was too steep. He said then that he would \"go to the Paris parade\" instead.\n\nTrump had originally ordered his own military parade after being wowed by a Bastille Day procession in Paris last year. The Armistice Day ceremony is expected to be far more solemn, without an overly military bent. It is, after all, intended to observe the end of war, not the practice of it.\n\nDuring his trip, Trump will visit two burial grounds near Paris set aside for some of the roughly 117,000 American military personnel who died in World War I.

US officials said the civil war in Syria and attempts to counter Iran would sit high on the agenda.\n\nEuropean leaders have been eyeing the President warily in his first two years in office, and Tuesday's election results were unlikely to ease many of their concerns. For Trump, a heavier focus on foreign policy could mean even more hostile confrontations over defense spending and trade, both reliable bugbears for the \"America First\" commander in chief. If the past days have provided an example, Trump's political chastening hasn't translated into a more moderate tack.\n\nIn the French capital, Trump will at least find himself in the company of leaders facing their own political doldrums. Macron, who enjoyed a honeymoon surge of popularity following his election last year, is now wallowing in unpopularity. Recent polls have pegged his approval rating in the 20% range. When he took off for a holiday with his wife in northern France recently, rumors percolated in the French press that he was recovering from exhaustion (he denied it).\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who for years has acted as Europe's de facto leader, is deflated. Never able to recover from her unpopular decision to allow entry to millions of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East, Merkel announced recently that she would not seek another term in office.\n\nAnd British Prime Minister Theresa May is still struggling to complete her country's exit from the European Union, a thankless task that has earned her both ridicule and rivals from her own party.

Without them, life has no meaning. \u2014 \u9a6c\u5efa Ma Jian (@majian53) November 8, 2018\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Director of Tai Kwun Timothy Calnin said organizers \"do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.\"\n\n\"The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,\" said Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, a pro-free speech organization.\n\n\"It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity,\" added Ng.\n\nA second replacement venue which had stepped in to host the event has also pulled out, according to Hong Kong Free Press. There's no mention of the venue on the Hong Kong Literary Festival web page promoting the Ma Jian talk.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ma will be allowed entry in the city. Writing on Twitter Thursday, Ma said that he remained \"determined to go\" to the city despite concerns that he would be turned away by immigration officials on arrival. \"It is precisely at times such as this when free speech is under threat that writers have a duty to speak out,\" he added.\n\nLast week, another Chinese dissident decided against traveling to Hong Kong amid heightened safety fears.\n\nArtist Badiucao had been due to present a new work at an event that was itself later canceled , following alleged threats made to the organizers.\n\nPosters of Chinese President Xi Jinping by dissident artist Badiucao.\n\n\"We are sorry to announce that the exhibition 'Gongle,' by Chinese artist Badiucao, has been canceled,\" the Hong Kong Free Press, a local publication which was co-sponsoring the event, said in a statement.\n\n\"The decision follows threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist. Whilst the organizers value freedom of expression, the safety of our partners remains a major concern.\"\n\nHong Kong police said that anyone with safety concerns should contact them, but would not comment on the individual case. Representatives of the Chinese government in Hong Kong also did not comment.\n\nTaken together, Mallet, Ma and Badiucao's experiences have raised severe concerns about Hong Kong's ongoing commitment to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, both of which are enshrined in its de facto constitution but heavily limited in mainland China.\n\n\"To deny Mallet his work after hosting Andy Chan from the HKNP at the FCC and expelling him from Hong Kong was ridiculous enough, and a grave infringement of press freedom in itself,\" democracy activist Joshua Wong said Friday.\n\n\"Banning him from the city altogether, even as a tourist, is nothing less than an authoritarian attempt to censor all opposing voices. This development is extremely worrying, especially for journalists sent to this city to report on Hong Kong and Chinese political situations. I hope that the international community can now see the severity of the situation of freedom in Hong Kong, and try to protect the rights of their own citizens here,\" added Wong."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A student and a deputy were among the 12 killed", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/Icu2XdQOiTg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:51", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) At least 12 lives were cut short Wednesday when a gunman stormed a Southern California bar and opened fire.\n\nOn Friday, the Ventura County Medical Examiner confirmed the identities of all the individuals killed.\n\nHere's what we know about the people who died in the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks.\n\nRon Helus, 54\n\nA 29-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, Ron Helus was hoping to retire in the next year or so.\n\nHe loved spending time with his son fishing in the Sierras, friend and colleague Sgt.

Here's the state of the race: DeSantis has 49.6% of the vote to 49.1% for Gillum. An automatic recount will be triggered if that margin drops to .5% or below. A Gillum campaign official told CNN's Ryan Nobles: \"Look, the mayor conceded, he called Ron DeSantis and congratulated the gov-elect, we understand the math. This was a historic result for a Democratic candidate. We got more votes than any previous successful candidate for governor, but we realize that it is not enough.\"\n\nGillum for Governor communications director Johanna Cervone said in a statement on Thursday said it was ready for a state-mandated recount.\n\n\"On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count,\" Cervone said. \"Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported. Our campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount.\"\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to reflect the most current vote totals."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump spars with Macron as Air Force One lands in France", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/dBw7zE5xDCs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:53", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump picked a fight with French President Emmanuel Macron over European defense just as Air Force One landed in France on Friday.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,\" Trump tweeted minutes after landing in France. He is set to spend the weekend in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I.\n\nTuesday on Europe 1 radio, Macron called for a \"real European army\" within the European Union, according to AFP\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\" Macron said.\n\nMacron also suggested that since the start of Trump's presidency, the US has been seen as a less reliable ally.\n\n\"When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\" he said.\n\nMacron has been advocating a similar position for months.\n\nA senior French official said Friday night that Trump took Macron's words out \"out of context.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Macron will likely want to respond to Trump's tweet directly himself, and likely Saturday.\n\nThe official, though, clarified the language Macron used, saying that the French leader did not mean he wanted a European army but better coordination and funding of Europe's already-existing resources.\n\nThe official said that Macron was conveying that Europe should organize better to protect itself. There is already a European defense project, and Macron would like to see more capability, the official said.\n\n\"Not a European army. He did not mean Europe should form an army,\" the official said. \"And this is all complementary to NATO, not separate from it.\"\n\nFurther strain in Trump-Macron relationship\n\nTrump's tweet on Friday could preview another high-level international meeting in which the US President distances himself from traditional American allies. Unlike the tense G7 summit in June, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present at this weekend's commemoration.\n\nWhile both Trump and Macron appeared to be off to a warm start following Trump's inauguration, their relationship appears to have soured.\n\nDuring a call about trade and migration in June, sources familiar with the call told CNN that it didn't end well.\n\n\"Just bad. It was terrible,\" a source told CNN . \"Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that.\"\n\nAnd more recently, a senior diplomatic source told CNN that Trump was \"ranting and venting on trade\" with Macron during their bilateral meeting in September.\n\nThere was \"some rapport\" between the two, \"but it's not what it (once) was,\" the source said.\n\nMacron isn't the only European leader to raise the prospect of Europe doing more for its own defense.\n\nEU President Donald Tusk made a similar suggestion in May after Trump had pulled out of the Iran deal and the Paris climate agreement, threatened a series of trade disputes with Europe and constantly criticized NATO.\n\n\"Europe must do everything in its power to protect, in spite of today's mood, the transatlantic bond. But at the same time we must be prepared for those scenarios, where we will have to act on our own,\" Tusk said.\n\nTusk also said that the EU \"should be grateful\" to Trump \"because, thanks to him, we have got rid of all illusions.\"\n\n\"Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies?\" Tusk said, later adding, \"He has made us realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump downplays Whitaker ties amid criticism", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MOyUcRPm1yg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:54", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from the Justice Department official he just named as acting attorney general in the face of mounting criticism about the legality and propriety of his appointment.\n\n\"I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said of the new acting attorney general, saying he hired him because he had worked for since-dismissed Attorney General Jeff Sessions . \"He was always extremely highly thought of, and he still is. But I didn't know Matt Whitaker. He worked for Attorney General Sessions.\"\n\nThe President's comments are at odds with the relationship Trump has forged with Whitaker in recent months, even as his opinion of Sessions continued to sour. Whitaker has been at the White House dozens of times, including in meetings with Trump, and the two have spoken by phone on several occasions, including on the day that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was expected to be fired.\n\nAnd in an October 11 interview on Fox News, Trump made clear he did, in fact, know Whitaker well.\n\n\"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker,\" he said.\n\nWhitaker was not hired as Sessions' chief of staff by virtue of any pre-existing relationship with Sessions, but instead because White House officials believed Whitaker's loyalties would lie at the White House and not with the beleaguered attorney general, sources said.\n\nAnd over the last year, Whitaker has told friends about his growing relationship with Trump. The President knew that he had played football and the tall, brawny former US attorney fit the image Trump liked, according to people familiar with their conversations, far more than the diminutive Sessions, whom Trump mocked.\n\n\"He looks like the kind of guy who sits at the head of a table,\" a source familiar with the matter said of Whitaker.\n\nQuestions arise\n\nEven as he claimed on Friday not to know Whitaker, it was clear Trump maintained an affinity for him, praising his qualifications for the job as he insisted Whitaker was being unfairly maligned.\n\nSome legal scholars -- including George Conway , the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- said they thought Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. Other critics have slammed Trump's decision to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because the move puts Whitaker in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which Whitaker had been publicly critical of.\n\nTrump insisted Friday that he had not spoken with Whitaker about the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker about it. I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President's move to distance himself from Whitaker is a familiar refrain Trump has used when associates of his have become embroiled in controversy.\n\nWhen federal prosecutors targeted his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen, Trump insisted Cohen handled only a \"tiny, tiny fraction\" of his legal work. Before that, he claimed that his indicted former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked for him for \"a very short period of time.\" And shortly before ousting his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who also helmed his campaign, Trump maintained Bannon \"came on very late.\"\n\nStill, the President praised Whitaker as \"very highly thought of\" and said that Whitaker is only taking heat because \"anybody that works for me, they do a number on him.\"\n\n\"Matt Whitaker is a very smart man, he is a very respected man in the law enforcement community, top of the line,\" Trump said. \"He's acting, I think he'll do a very good job and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nIn an email to Department of Justice staff on Friday, Whitaker vowed to lead \"a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\"\n\nSense of concern\n\nJUST WATCHED Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company 03:05\n\nTrump's comments came as a growing sense of concern developed inside the White House over the negative reaction to Whitaker being tapped as the acting chief law enforcement official. Several senior officials said they were surprised by the criticism and believe it could potentially jeopardize his chances to remain in the post if it continues to dominate headlines.\n\nIt was not widely known among the staff that he had commented repeatedly on the special counsel's investigation in interviews and on television -- an irony given that Whitaker's TV appearances helped him land his job at the Justice Department and people close to Trump encouraged Whitaker to keep up his TV appearances to draw Trump's attention.\n\nWhitaker was tapped by the White House to serve as Sessions' chief of staff in September 2017, with sources describing then-White House counsel Don McGahn as the person behind the hiring.\n\nMcGahn was drawn to Whitaker because he had a stalwart reputation in right-wing legal circles and because the White House wanted someone who was competent, could mind Sessions and could \"keep things on the rails\" at the Justice Department.\n\nLeonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, said he recommended Whitaker for that post.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo told CNN. \"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department. Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager. He's a no-nonsense, get-it-done kind of guy.\"\n\nWhitaker and White House chief of staff John Kelly developed a close relationship too. Kelly would often call Whitaker to convey when Trump was unhappy with something at the Justice Department or with Sessions in particular, and another source said Kelly and Whitaker were \"cut from the same cloth.\"\n\nWhitaker also worked to forge a relationship with the President's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner during trips to the White House, understanding they were key to moving up in Trump's eyes.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who is a Sessions ally and familiar with his senior staff, described Whitaker as a \"good lawyer\" with \"good political skills and instincts\" and said he had grown close to the White House.\n\nTerwilliger said Whitaker's position had put him in contact with the White House \"where he's held in pretty high regard.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Rosenstein calls Whitaker a 'superb' choice for acting attorney general", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/yJ3t06tuBLg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:54", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Friday hailed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker as a \"superb\" choice to fill the role even as Whitaker's past statements have prompted questions about his impartiality toward special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"I think he's a superb choice for attorney general,\" Rosenstein told a small group of reporters gathered outside of an investiture ceremony for US Attorney Zachary Terwilliger in Alexandria, Virginia. \"He certainly understands the work, understands the priorities of the department.\"\n\nThe positive tone from the No. 2 official at the Justice Department was notable, as Rosenstein and Whitaker have had a complicated relationship for some time, compounded by the fact that Whitaker had discussed taking Rosenstein's job with President Donald Trump several weeks ago.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Doctors share gun stories, demand action after NRA tells them to 'stay in their lane'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DpMBghpNdxY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:56", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage.

This is an increase from 2012-13, when the national rate was 3.7 per 100,000 nationwide and 4.1 per 100,000 for major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe rates vary widely by city. For example, there's a higher chance of being killed by a gun in New Orleans than in the Providence, Rhode Island, area. About 1 in 100,000 residents was killed by a gun in Providence and Warwick combined, compared with 16.6 per 100,000 residents in New Orleans.\n\nNationally, homicide was the 16th-leading cause of death, the new report notes. Guns were used in 74% of those deaths. For children between the ages of 10 and 19, guns were used in even more homicides: 87%.\n\nMen and boys were most often the victims of homicides, accounting for 85% of the firearm deaths.\n\nFor suicides, there is also a great variety between cities. Oklahoma City, for instance, saw 13.5 suicides by gun per 100,000 residents, compared with New York, Newark and Jersey City, which combined for a rate of 1.5 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of people older than 10 who are using a gun to kill themselves has increased, too. Researchers don't use statistics from gun deaths for children under 10, because those self-inflicted deaths are probably accidentals, according to the report.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for everyone over 10, with guns used in half of all those deaths. It's the second-leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 19, with guns used in 42% of those cases.\n\nThough the gun suicide rate for young people is notably lower than for other age groups, the report finds that those numbers are increasing.\n\n\"I rarely take care of a suicide attempt with a gun in the emergency room. The kinetic energy of a bullet is far more effective than taking pills that have a longer duration and more opportunity for intervention,\" said Dr. Stephen Hargarten , director of the Comprehensive Injury Center, associate dean of the Office of Global Health and a professor of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nHargarten, who was not involved in the new report, said many groups are working to reduce firearm-related suicides, but it remains \"such a challenging area.\"\n\nThe latest increase in gun-related deaths is similar to the rates seen in the 2006-07 time period, the report said. The US has the world's highest rate of gun ownership by civilians, according to research, and the highest rate of gun-related deaths among industrialized countries.\n\nThe authors of the new report note that it is \"too soon to know\" whether this recent increase in gun deaths represents a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.\n\nHargarten said he hopes the US government will see an increase in gun deaths in the proper frame, \"as a complex biological and sociological disease,\" and increase funding for research. Gun violence is the least-studied of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, a 2017 study found\n\nHargarten said he has seen cities, states and even major medical groups starting to spend more money on this kind of research, but he -- like many others who do research on gun violence -- feels that the federal government needs to \"step it up\" to figure out what is causing this problem.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Where is the federal government in all of this? When there are so many deaths, we need to invest in this issue now,\" Hargarten said. \"Look what we did with HIV and AIDS when it was breaking out in the '80s and '90s. The federal government addressed it, and the complexity and the political issues, and it helped groups most at risk, by investing our resources appropriately, and it made a huge difference in that disease process. It's imperative that we do that for guns.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Trump administration weakens Obamacare birth control coverage mandate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/clAlWW-oCtQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:57", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Trump administration issued two final rules on Wednesday providing employers more flexibility with exemptions to deny women insurance coverage for birth control.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employer-provided health insurance plans are required to cover birth control as a preventive service.\n\nNow, the US Department of Health and Human Services has issued a final rule providing exemption from the contraceptive coverage mandate to entities that object to such coverage based on religious beliefs.

It based that percentage on the 165 million women in America, many of whom are not in their childbearing years.\n\nThe agency calculated that, at most, 120,000 women would be affected: mainly those who work at the roughly 200 entities that have been involved in 50 or so lawsuits over birth control coverage.\n\nPolicy experts, however, argued that this could open the door to hundreds of employers dropping coverage.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor instance, there are hundreds of Catholic hospitals, nursing homes and nonprofits that may want to stop providing contraceptives, said Tim Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nExperts pointed out last year that many women use birth control for more than pregnancy prevention, including treatment of hormonal imbalances and endometriosis.\n\n\"There is no way to know how many women will be affected,\" said Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy research and communications."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Minister Jo Johnson quits over Brexit and calls for new vote", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46155403", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:14:57", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Brexit deal \"will see us cede control\" - Jo Johnson\n\nJo Johnson has quit as transport minister and called for the public to have a fresh say on Brexit.\n\nThe MP, who is Boris Johnson's brother but voted Remain in the referendum, said the deal being negotiated with the EU \"will be a terrible mistake\".\n\nArguing Britain was \"on the brink of the greatest crisis\" since World War Two, he said what was on offer wasn't \"anything like what was promised\".\n\nDowning Street thanked him for his work but ruled out another referendum.\n\nJo Johnson voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum while his brother Boris, who quit as foreign secretary in July, was a leading Brexiteer.\n\nHis brother praised his decision, saying they were \"united in dismay\" at the PM's handling of the negotiations.\n\nCabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU.

including non plug-in varieties - showed an average real-world mpg of 49.06, still vastly lower than the potential range.\n\n\"There are some examples where employees aren't even charging these vehicles up,\" said Paul Hollick, The Miles Consultancy's managing director.\n\n\"The charge cables are still in the boot, in a cellophane wrapper, while the company and the employee are going in and out of petrol stations, paying for all of this additional fuel.\n\nThis practice, he added, was \"ridiculous\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK government subsidised plug in hybrids for seven years\n\nThe British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), which represents many fleets, said higher taxes on diesel cars incentivised companies to buy plug-ins, even if they had no intention of using their electric capability.\n\n\"We unfortunately have got a situation where a poorly designed tax regime is driving some poor behaviours,\" said Toby Poston, \u200bthe BVRLA's communications director.\n\n\"We have got some situations where company drivers are choosing the vehicle based on their tax liability, rather than having the right vehicle for the right job.\"\n\nSome companies, he explained, were buying PHEVs - which are best suited to local trips - for employees who did a lot of motorway driving.\n\nWhen presented with The Miles Consultancy's findings, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the government believed plug-in hybrids \"bring significant environmental benefits\", but would \"now focus its support on zero emission models like pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars\".\n\nPlug-in hybrid vehicles continue to receive some government support, through lower car tax rates, grants for charging infrastructure and, in some local authorities, free parking."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "California wildfires: Five dead and more than 150,000 evacuated", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46155767", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:15:07", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'How much more can this town endure?' -

Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter.\n\nHousehold spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit.\n\nBusiness investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSimon Jack, business editor\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all.\n\nWorryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over.\n\nPlenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.\n\n'Signs of weakness'\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond said: \"Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade.\"\n\nONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: \"The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.\n\n\"However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.\"\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.\n\n\"The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.\"\n\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Which cabinet minister uses Lego to relax after a busy day?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46149899", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:15:29", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Press Association and Lego\n\nA cabinet minister has spoken about how he likes to unwind by spending time with his \"very large\" Lego collection.\n\nCulture Secretary Jeremy Wright told Talk Radio he found assembling the building bricks \"therapeutic\".\n\n\"I think everybody who does any difficult or stressful job needs a way to switch off,\" he said. \"We all have different ways, mine is Lego.\"\n\nThe Conservative MP also said claims that he did not read any newspapers were \"complete nonsense\".\n\nMr Wright, whose department is conducting a review of the future economic viability of the press, raised eyebrows last month when he told a media conference he did not subscribe to any newspapers or magazines.\n\nHe told Talk Radio that he had given a straight answer to a straight question when he was asked if he had read a newspaper on the morning of the Society of Editors event in Salford.\n\n\"The answer I gave was I didn't read a newspaper that morning which was true,\" he said. \"To suggest that I don't read newspapers is complete nonsense, of course I do.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May is asked how she unwinds\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron mis-remembers which football team he supports\n\nWhat politicians do in their spare time is a subject of enduring interest and occasionally political significance.\n\nFor some, it is watching their local football team - if they can remember which one they support - or going to the opera.

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"At a global level there is no migration solution,\" Prof Murray says.\n\nBut while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "NHS outpatients service 'stuck in the 18th Century'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46142276", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:15:32", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 127 millon outpatient appointments every year\n\nThe way hospitals in the UK run outpatient clinic appointments is stuck \"in the 18th Century\", leading doctors say.\n\nEvery year millions of people travel to hospitals, where doctors check up on their health and discuss their care.\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians said many appointments were unnecessary - and outdated, inefficient systems meant large numbers were missed or cancelled.\n\nIt said the situation was frustrating for patients, and wasting money.\n\nThe RCP's report said the time had come to overhaul the system by embracing innovation: making more use of remote monitoring and telephone and video consultations.\n\nGetting other staff, such as senior nurses, to run clinics closer to people's homes could also help.\n\nIt said a number of places had already started taking these steps, but much more needed to be done.\n\nDr Toby Hillman, of the RCP, said: \"It's an 18th Century system.

I put my hands to my head and I was drenched in sweat. I knew straight away it was a heart attack,\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\nShe was a healthy 38-year-old when she had a Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), a rare and often undiagnosed condition.\n\nIt is the leading cause of heart attacks in women of childbearing age, affecting around 1,000 women a year.\n\nIt occurs when there is a sudden tear in one of the coronary arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart.\n\nIn hospital, Hayley, from Congleton in Cheshire, feared the worst.\n\n\"I can remember saying to them, 'am I dying?' And they just kept saying, 'we've tried everything we can, but nothing is working,'\" she said.\n\n'I felt less of a woman'\n\nShe survived, but like many women with SCAD, was told pregnancy would mean the risk of another heart attack.\n\n\"I think it was another thing that was stolen from me, so I almost don't allow myself to think about it, because it could take you down a dark path of sadness,\" Hayley reflected.\n\n\"I felt less of a person, less of a woman, more of a failure, like I was faulty.\"\n\nWhat is SCAD?\n\nSpontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an under-diagnosed heart condition\n\nIt affects mainly women, occasionally during - or soon after - pregnancy\n\nMenopause, extreme stress and exercise have also been associated with it\n\nDuring an attack, a sudden tear or bruise develops in one of the coronary arteries blocking the blood follow\n\nIt can cause death, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and require heart bypass surgery\n\nSource: Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit\n\nPatient's decision\n\nHayley is the kind of woman who consultant cardiologist Dr Abi Al-Hussaini is trying to help, with her clinic at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.\n\nImage caption Dr Al-Hussaini aims to allow women to make an informed decision on whether to have a baby.\n\nDr Al-Hussaini assesses the damage done to the heart by the SCAD and reviews the patient's medication, generally lowering the amount they are on.\n\nShe uses that information to advise the patient how risky a pregnancy could be.\n\nThis does mean sometimes she has to advise that the risk to health might be very high, but the key is the patient makes the decision, rather than the usual blanket advice not to get pregnant.\n\nIf one of her patients decides to proceed, they are referred to the pre-existing \"high risk pregnancy team\" at the hospital, who monitor them throughout the pregnancy.\n\n\"I have seen a lot of patients over the last few years who have come to me unhappy that they have been told they cannot have a child ever again,\" she explained.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I established the clinic, to give these patients the correct advice and allow them to make an informed decision themselves.\"\n\nShe believes a lack of research into the condition is why most cardiologists prefer the blanket advice.\n\nSharp pain\n\nOne of the first women helped by the clinic was Julie Murphy, 40, from Ruislip.\n\nImage caption Julie Murphy and Holly play with baby Bella, who was born in April\n\nShortly before her honeymoon in 2013, she started to feel unwell, like she had flu. While on holiday in Kenya, the symptoms got worse.\n\nThen, while swimming, she had a sharp pain in her chest. When she got home, she had tests on her heart and, \"the next day I found out I'd had a heart attack\".\n\nThe days and weeks that followed were very tough.\n\n\"All the medication I was on really slowed me down so I couldn't even walk up the stairs when I came home from hospital. That was really difficult to get my head around,\" she says.\n\nLike Hayley, Julie was initially told she would not be able to have children. But she became part of a research project led by Dr Al-Hussaini and had her first daughter, Holly, in 2015.\n\n'Awesome team'\n\nShe then became one of the clinic's first patients when she became pregnant for a second time.\n\n\"I was worried that they would say there's no possibility or it would be too dangerous for us to try to have a baby, that it might mean that I'm putting my life at risk,\" she said.\n\nBella was born in April.\n\n\"They're such an awesome team that you felt so looked after,\" Julie said.\n\nDespite the hope she is giving patients, Dr Al-Hussaini says she has encountered resistance from doctors around the world, in terms of what advice they give their patients.\n\n\"In America, they are against becoming pregnant any time after a heart attack, or having had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection,\" she said.\n\n\"But again, I think that's because there hasn't been a huge amount of research - but there is a growing amount of research at the moment that's been developed.\"\n\nFollow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Epilepsy: 'I'm not daydreaming Miss, I'm having a seizure'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46099603", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:15:37", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Olivia was diagnosed with absence seizures at the age of 11\n\n\"When I was younger my teachers thought I was naughty and 'away with the fairies'.

And the name, \"painted wolves\", seems so apt.\n\nTheir dappled tan and black fur, shot through with flashes of white, dazzles in the sunlight.\n\nYou're going to become very familiar with these creatures; you may even fall in love with them, because they will feature in David Attenborough's new blockbuster TV series, Dynasties.\n\nThe BBC spent months filming the endangered African wild dogs of Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe, and wildlife photographer Nick Dyer says viewers will be enthralled by the result.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption On the prowl: The animals are now officially classed as Endangered\n\nThe former London fund manager and marketing executive now dedicates his time and his camera to promoting the animals' conservation, walking with three packs as they roam the floodplain of the Zambezi River.\n\n\"During the day, they're mostly asleep but when they wake up, they leap and dance with absolute joy,\" he tells me. \"They have this great social bonding thing we call a greeting ceremony. They're so full of play, especially with their pups, so they're always chasing and pulling each other's tails, which is really great fun to watch.\"\n\nThe first thing you need to know about painted wolves is that they're not wolves, nor, as their more boring name suggests, are they dogs.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Echo: The dogs swivel their big ears to hear what's going on even at great distance\n\nSome readers may find the next image distressing\n\nThey're in a separate evolutionary group from these more familiar canids. Lycaon pictus is their scientific name, which means something like \"painted wolf-like\".\n\nBut they certainly behave much like wolves and dogs. Lots of movement and lots of noise.\n\n\"They have several calls, but perhaps the most endearing sound they make is the hoo call,\" explains Nick.\n\n\"If they get separated from the pack, they put their head low and make this 'hoo, hoo' noise, which is an incredibly haunting sound, but that sound can travel up to 2km and with their big ears they can pick it up, and that reunites the pack.\"\n\nWhisper it quietly, they're also just a bit smelly.

In France, around 10,000 sheep were killed in wolf attacks in 2016, with the government paying out some \u20ac3.2m in compensation.\n\nNow the EU hopes that by relaxing the rules on reimbursing farmers for the damage done by carnivores, it will lessen the need for farmers to kill these threatened species.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, member states will be able to fully compensate farmers for damages caused by wolves and bears.

They have more to fear from us than we have from them.\"\n\nWhile the EU has sanctioned increased payments for farmers in the hope that this might reduce the need for culling, the money has not always been forthcoming from governments.

More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Antarctic: Nasa shares close-up photos of big PIG iceberg", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153327", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:15:47", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA ICEBRIDGE/Brooke Medley Image caption Icebergs calve from the front of glaciers that terminate in the sea\n\nScientists this week got their first close-up look at the big new iceberg that's calved from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Antarctic.\n\nThe block, which has the designation B-46, initially covered 225 sq km.\n\nGiven the fashion in recent years to compare such bergs with the area of Manhattan Island, that would have made this one roughly three times the size of the famous district in New York.\n\nBut the Nasa over-flight on Wednesday shows the berg is already breaking up.\n\nThe US space agency DC-8 was on a routine expedition as part of the IceBridge project, which measures the elevation of ice surfaces with a laser.\n\nResearchers onboard were able to point their cameras out the windows of the aircraft and capture some of the scale and beauty of the frozen scene below.\n\nThe PIG drains a vast area of west Antarctica that is roughly equivalent to two-thirds the area of the UK.

Some buildings caught fire and were damaged but the main facility, Adventist Health Feather River Hospital, was not, spokeswoman Jill Kinney said.\n\nSome of the patients were initially turned around during their evacuation because of gridlocked traffic and later airlifted to other hospitals, along with some staff, Kinney said.\n\nFour hospital employees were briefly trapped in the basement and rescued by California Highway Patrol officers, Kinney said.\n\nConcerned friends and family posted frantic messages on Twitter and other sites saying they were looking for loved ones, particularly seniors who lived at retirement homes or alone.\n\nChico police officer John Barker and his partner evacuated several seniors from an apartment complex.\n\n\"Most of them were immobile with walkers, or spouses that were bed-ridden, so we were trying to get additional units to come and try and help us, just taking as many as we could,\" he said, describing the community as having \"a lot of elderly, a lot of immobile people, some low-income with no vehicles.\"\n\nKelly Lee called shelters looking for her husband's 93-year-old grandmother, Dorothy Herrera, who was last heard from on Thursday morning.

He would like to be a doctor or an engineer.\n\n\"I always liked studying, but I could not afford to continue,\" Ramirez told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhen Ramirez was eight years old, his father died in an accident. When he was 12, his mother died of a heart attack. He has no siblings.\n\nRamirez lived with an uncle, but his uncle left Honduras a few months ago to migrate to the US. Ramirez has not heard from him since. He had a job at a local hardware store for a while, but was let go.\n\n\"There is no work these days,\" he said.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera spoke with Ramirez, he was waiting in line for a donated blanket to stay warm during the cold Mexico City nights. He and several thousand other Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty were staying in a stadium that had been transformed into a makeshift refugee camp.\n\nManaged by the Mexico City government and the city human rights commission, the camp was abuzz with activity all week, as groups large and small trickled into the capital city.\n\nMigrants and refugees rested in the stadium bleachers, large tents in the field, and grassy areas outside the stadium. Others received medical attention, watched their kids being entertained by clowns, or waited in line for food, clothing and blankets. Little cheering circles formed around impromptu dance and song performances here and there on the sports complex grounds.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 Central Americans stayed at the stadium this week, and thousands more are slowly making their way up through southern Mexico in subsequent caravans from Honduras and El Salvador. Preparations for more caravans are in the works. Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, and other Latin Americans have also joined the various waves of the ongoing exodus.\n\nRamirez made it the first 1,650km through Guatemala and up to Mexico City. Like most of the thousands of migrants and refugees, he wants to make it the next 2,700km to the US border.\n\nAt an assembly Thursday evening, the migrants and refugees voted to choose a route to the Tijuana border crossing. It is more than 1,000km further away than the closest points of entry to the US, but it is a safer route. It avoids parts of northeastern Mexico with high rates of homicides and forced disappearances, including of migrants and refugees.\n\nThe assembly chose to depart at 5am local time (11:00 GMT) Friday, but plans changed overnight and the majority of migrants and refugees at the stadium chose to stay in the hopes of obtaining bus transport to the border.\n\nMany people chose not to wait, however, and hundreds of people set out Friday morning towards Queretaro, along the route to Tijuana. The remaining thousands plan to leave before dawn on Saturday, migrant and refugee caravan spokespeople said at a press conference on Friday.\n\n'Asylum not a loophole, it's a lifeline'\n\nThe migrant and refugee caravans have not yet reached their halfway point to the US border, but the administration of US President Donald Trumphas been reinforcing the border with concertina wire and a heavy military presence.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nMore than 5,000 active duty troops have been deployed to border areas in California, Arizona and Texas, and thousands more may be on the way in the near future. Last week, US President Donald Trump announced that any rocks thrown at troops along the border will be considered firearms.\n\nTrump also announced plans to indefinitely detain asylum seekers in makeshift tent camps in the desert while their asylum claims are processed.\n\nThe administration went further on Thursday and announced plans to restrict asylum claims to official points of entry into the US. An Interim Final Rule granted Trump broad authority to block or restrict asylum claims \"if he determines it is in the national interest to do so\", Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a joint statement Thursday.\n\n\"Our asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it,\" according to Nielsen and Whitaker.\n\nTrump signed an presidential proclamation on Friday that puts those regulations into practice.\n\nMigrant and human rights groups quickly condemned the measure as illegal. US legislation and international law state that any person can seek asylum whether or not they cross the border at an official point of entry, they pointed out.\n\n\"Asylum is not a loophole, it is a lifeline. This policy needlessly places the lives of thousands of people in danger,\" Amnesty International's Secretary General Kami Naidoo said Thursday in a statement.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit Friday to challenge the asylum restrictions.\n\n\"Neither the president nor his cabinet can override the clear commands of our law, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.

Last month, del Carmen, her 20-year-old daughter and her 21-year-old son-in-law fled their home in La Libertad, a small city in southern El Salvador, on the Pacific coast.\n\nAfter making their way through Guatemala, the trio crossed the Suchiate River into Mexico on a raft. They stayed in Tapachula, in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, for a week, after a local man offered them a room.\n\nThere they joined the caravan after a relative alerted them to the thousands of Hondruans on their way.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nDel Carmen and her relatives fled after receiving death threats from gang members. She and her daughter lived in a neighbourhood controlled by the Barrio 18 gang, but her son-in-law lived in another area of the city controlled by the MS-13 gang.\n\nBoth gangs originated in Los Angeles, California, and only also set down roots and spread in Central America following a wave of deportations of Salvadorans from the US.\n\nThe problems started after the family went to the beach to swim. Del Carmen's son-in-law was from MS-13 controlled territory but that particular beachfront area is controlled by Barrio 18, and crossing the gang divide can have serious consequences even for unaffiliated residents, del Carmen said\n\nIn many neighbourhoods in cities around El Salvador, people are stuck in the territory of whichever gang controls where they live, said del Carmen. Her son-in-law was threatened with violence, and when del Carmen and her daughter stepped in to stand up for him, they all received death threats.\n\n\"They threatened all three of us,\" said del Carmen.\n\nThe threats were the final straw, but the challenges and risks presented by violence and extortion in their neighbourhood were far from new.\n\nDel Carmen made a living baking bread and selling it while walking through the city streets. Usually gang members left street vendors alone, opting to target stationary businesses for extortion, but sometimes when they were drunk or high, they would also demand money from local street vendors, she said.\n\n\"I would have to give $10 or $20. I would always give it,\" said del Carmen.\n\nThat is approximately the same range as her daily earnings from bread sales, but paying was preferable to losing all the bread and cash she carried at any given moment, said del Carmen.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke with del Carmen and her relatives earlier this week while they rested at the Mexico City stadium, nestled together in a spot between sets of stairs halfway up the stadium bleachers. Having had a chance to rest between long stretches on foot and hitchhiking, the family was in good spirits.\n\nDel Carmen's original plan was to gradually head north up through Mexico, working along the way.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants,

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

But it's now banned anywhere else along the border.\n\nFor example, tens of thousands of immigrants in recent years have been showing up in the Arizona desert or crossing the Rio Grande in Texas and then turning themselves in to border agents and seeking asylum. Under the new rules, those immigrants will now face steep barriers to getting in the country \u2014 and deportation in many cases.\n\nThe government says about 70,000 people who went around official crossings in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 sought asylum. Another 24,000 presented themselves to U.S. inspectors.\n\nWhy does the administration say the asylum system is crisis?\n\nThe United States fielded 331,700 asylum claims last year, nearly double from two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Many are families and young children fleeing gangs and poverty in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nThe surge has contributed to an enormous backlog in immigration courts, which is where asylum cases must be decided if the applicant passes an initial screening. The backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week.\n\nAsylum seekers are often released, many with ankle monitors, while their cases wind through court for years. The Trump administration calls it\"catch and release\" and notes that, while about 8 of 10 asylum seekers pass the initial screening, known as a\"credible fear\" interview, most are ultimately unsuccessful in court.\n\nThere are many reasons why the courts are broken. Immigrant advocates point to a shortage of judges.\n\nWill it work?\n\nAlmost immediately, the American Civil Liberties Union sued over the president's order in federal court in San Francisco, seeking to declare it invalid and stop it from going into effect while litigation is pending.\n\nTrump is invoking the same extraordinary powers he used to ban travel to the U.S. from several predominantly Muslim countries, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in June. Under a section of federal immigration law, the president may deny entry to\"any class of aliens\" whose presence is deemed\"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"\n\nBut under the Immigration and Nationality Act, anyone can apply for asylum no matter how or where they enter the country. And the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, of which the U.S. is a signatory, says people may apply for asylum even if they enter a country illegally.\n\nAdministration officials argue that U.S. law already has some bars on asylum \u2014 being part of a terrorist organization or having committed a serious crime, for example \u2014 and that\"withholding of removal\" and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThe administration also emphasizes that people can still seek asylum at official crossings instead of entering the country illegally by going around them, but that poses logistical challenges. Asylum seekers currently wait in Mexican border cities \u2014 up to five weeks in Tijuana \u2014 because inspectors at U.S. crossings say they don't have the capacity to process their claims.\n\nWhat will happen to the immigrants?\n\nUnder the new rule, immigrants caught crossing the border and seeking asylum will be transported to a nearby port of entry and denied asylum if they seek it.\n\nThey will be allowed to seek other, more limited forms of protection but the initial screening, known as a\"reasonable fear\" interview, is much harder to pass. And these variations of asylum \u2014 \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the U.N.

The plan was immediately challenged in court.\n\nTrump invoked the same powers he used last year to impose a travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court. The new regulations are intended to circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country. About 70,000 people per year who enter the country illegally claim asylum, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe need people in our country but they have to come in legally,'' Trump said Friday as he departed for Paris.\n\nQuick response\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups swiftly sued in federal court in Northern California to block the regulations, arguing the measures were clearly illegal.\n\n\u201cThe president is simply trying to run roughshod over Congress' decision to provide asylum to those in danger regardless of the manner of one's entry,'' said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\nThe litigation also seeks to put the rules on hold while the litigation progresses.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether the case would go before a judge before the rules go into effect Saturday. They would be in place for at least three months but could be extended, and don't affect people already in the country.\n\nTrump's announcement was the latest push to enforce a hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress, which has not passed any immigration law reform. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to retreat.\n\nOfficials said the asylum law changes are meant to funnel migrants through official border crossings for speedy rulings instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border. Border Patrol agents in Yuma said they arrested nearly 450 migrants in western Arizona this week.\n\nBut the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to turn around and come back to make their claims.\n\nEven despite that, illegal crossings are historically low.\n\nBacklogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing.\n\nSwamping the system\n\n\u201cThe arrival of large numbers ... will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands ... into the interior of the United States,'' Trump said in the proclamation, calling it a crisis.\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \u201cwithholding of removal'' \u2014 which is similar to asylum but doesn't allow for obtaining green cards or bringing families \u2014 or protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they were adding staffing at the border crossings to manage the expected crush, but it's not clear how migrants, specifically families, would be held as their cases are adjudicated. Family detention centers are largely at capacity. Trump has said he wanted to erect \u201ctent cities,'' but nothing has been funded or decided.\n\nThe U.S. is also working with Mexico to send some migrants back across the border. Right now, laws allow only Mexican nationals to be swiftly returned, and increasingly those claiming asylum are from Central America, not Mexico.\n\nTrump pushed immigration issues hard in the days leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections, railing against the caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nHe has made little mention of the issue since the election but has sent troops to the border in response. As of Thursday, there were more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas.\n\nBirthright citizenship\n\nTrump also suggested he'd revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect the tent cities to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations, but Trump insisted the citizenship issue would be pushed through.\n\n\u201cWe're signing it. We're doing it,'' he said.\n\nThe administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits. In 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number from two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years and the immigration court backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nIt's unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. Roughly 5,000 migrants \u2014 more than 1,700 under age 18 \u2014 sheltered in a Mexico City sports complex decided to depart Friday for the northern city of Tijuana, opting for the longer but likely safer route to the U.S. border.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border, particularly to Tijuana.

Paradise has been mostly destroyed in a quick-moving fire that forced thousands of residents to flee.\n\nThe blaze, which broke out Thursday, had nearly quadrupled overnight to 285 square kilometers and was rapidly approaching the outskirts of the nearby city of Chico. Officials said the fire is only 5 percent contained.\n\nIn addition to the five people found dead in their vehicles, many people were forced to abandon their cars, which got struck in gridlocked traffic, and run for their lives.\n\nCalifornia fire officials said crews gave up fighting the flames Thursday and instead helped people get out alive. \"These firefighters were in the rescue mode all day yesterday,'' said Capt.

The fire was also burning in parts of Los Angeles County.\n\nFire officials said strong Santa Ana winds continued to fuel the Woolsey Fire overnight, doubling its size to nearly 3,248 hectares.\n\nThe blaze also forced the entire evacuation of Malibu, a city of about 13,000 people that is home to many Hollywood celebrities. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted, \"imminent threat!,\" as the fire raged through the Santa Monica Mountains toward the ocean.\n\n\"If you've been told to go, get out of there,\" said Los Angeles County Sheriff Department Chief John Benedict.\n\nAlso burning farther west in Ventura County was the Hill Fire, which fire officials said burned nearly 4,050 hectares by Thursday night.

Nor must it lead to conflict,\" Mattis said.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling of the dialogue signaled an effort by the two sides to contain the slide in the relationship, it did not address the core dispute on trade. Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, in a push to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and push back against what the U.S. views as predatory Chinese tactics on the high technology industry. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 million worth of U.S. goods.\n\nYun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said Beijing is uncertain about what exactly Trump wants out of a trade deal, but hopes that with U.S. midterm elections out of the way, the mercurial American president may be more inclined to reach a compromise. \"Their top priority is to stabilize relations,\" she said.\n\nOn human rights, Pompeo voiced concern over China's treatment of religious minorities, including the mass detention of minority Uighur Muslims. But overall, the tone of the U.S. officials' public comments was milder than that of the Chinese. Yang insisted that Chinese people have freedom of religion, and that \"foreign countries have no right to interfere.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Touches Down in Paris, Hits Back at His Host", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-touches-down-in-paris-and-hits-back-at-macron/4652688.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:06", "body_paragraphs": "The moment Air Force One touched down Friday at Orly airport, U.S. President Donald Trump blasted a caustic message for his host, terming French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s call for a European military \u201cvery insulting.\u201d\n\nIn the touchdown tweet, Trump suggested Europe first pay \u201cits fair share\u201d of NATO before contemplating a Europe-wide force.\n\nAs he stepped off his plane, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, a group of White House reporters shouted questions at him about the Twitter message.

He has also emphasized that the United States needs to take care of itself first before the needs of other nations, rejecting the concept of globalism.\n\nMacron, during a visit to the World War I Western Front at Verdun, told Europe 1 radio that in face of a revived threat from Moscow, Europe needed to \u201cdefend itself better alone.\" Europeans, he said, cannot protect themselves without a \u201ctrue European army.\u201d\n\nMacron, in the interview, also blasted Trump\u2019s recent announcement that Washington would withdraw from the 1987 INF Treaty limiting nuclear weapons that U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to.\n\nThe \u201cmain victim\u201d of the withdrawal, Macron argued, is \u201cEurope and its security.\u201d\n\nEuropean force\n\nThe French president added that Europe also has to protect itself \u201cwith respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\"\n\nNine defense ministers from European countries are discussing how such a new international force would operate.\n\nEuropean leaders have been rattled since a NATO summit earlier in the year, when they perceived Trump\u2019s demands for billions of additional dollars in military spending from them as a threat that the United States would pull out of the nearly 70-year-old alliance.\n\nBut the idea of a European army has limited support in Berlin and London.

Officials are still tallying mail-in ballots, with Sinema ahead by fewer than 10,000 votes.

The FDA's planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.\n\nThere has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an \"epidemic.\"\n\n\"E-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 trend among teens,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. \"The disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we're seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end. It's simply not tolerable.\"\n\nThat growth has coincided with the rise of Juul, whose sales of vaping devices grew from 2.2 million in 2016 to 16.2 million devices last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe agency threatened in September to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors. The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.\n\nThe planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.\n\nJuul competitors\n\nThe only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc, British American Tobacco Plc, Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc.\n\nThose products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nE-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul's business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco's global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.\n\nAltria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA's concerns about teen usage. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.\n\nRepresentatives from Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco did not respond to requests for comment Thursday evening. A Juul spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe companies have previously said their products are intended for adult use and that they work to ensure retailers comply with the law.\n\nDivisive products\n\nJuul has previously said the company wants to be \"part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people\" but that \"appropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch.\"\n\nMeredith Berkman, a founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, which seeks to curb underage use, said the agency's move was a \"good first step,\" but added that \"the final step should have happened yesterday.\"\n\n\"Why not do away with flavors altogether, why not do away with online sales altogether?\" she said.\n\nE-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.\n\nLast year the FDA, under Gottlieb, extended until 2022 a deadline for e-cigarette companies to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda Prepares to Fight Off Ebola Along DRC Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-prepares-to-fight-off-ebola-along-drc-border-/4651129.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:10", "body_paragraphs": "In Uganda, officials have stepped up measures to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

The Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, to be exact.\n\nSo could it be that the object, called Oumuamua, Hawaiian for 'scout', is truly some kind of alien artifact, or an actual space probe sent to spy on all us Earthlings?\n\nHate to be a bummer, but no!\n\nLet's throw away our scientific and journalist objectivity for a moment and admit that most people want the answer to be 'yes.'\n\nThat's why scientists spend so much time looking for extrasolar planets that are like Earth, and why we want to get closer looks at Mars, and send probes to Europa or Enceladus or any place with oceans of liquid water. Researchers and astronomers all want some proof that humans are not all alone in the universe.\n\nBut in this case, based on conversations VOA has had with astronomers, and based on everything scientists know about space rocks, comets, and asteroids, Oumuamua doesn't seem to be acting much differently than any other space rock out there in the void.\n\nBut here's what scisntists do know about Oumuamua, and that might help explain why some scientists are so excited about it, whether it offers proof of alien intelligence or not.\n\nOumuamua was the first interstellar object to visit our solar system. That means it came from another star system like our own. It flew between Mercury and the Sun in November 2017, almost exactly a year ago.\n\nIt moved really quickly, at about 136-thousand kilometers per hour. Michele Bannister from Queen's College in Belfast told VOA that scientists only had about three weeks to get a good look at it.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nOumuamua is reddish, and about 400 meters long. However, it's 10 times longer than it is wide, so basically it looks a bit like a giant, dirty interstellar icicle. In space terms, 400 meters is tiny, so just finding the thing was a big win for astronomers.\n\n\u201cFor decades we\u2019ve theorized that such interstellar objects are out there,\" says NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen \"and now\u2015for the first time\u2015we have direct evidence they exist.\u201d\n\nThat's really interesting, but how did the whole \"aliens\" thing get started? Well, it turns out that Oumuamua is definitely 'unusual' in that it isn't just ambling through the galaxy. It's changing speed and direction by itself. Bannister calls this \"non-gravitational acceleration.\"\n\nIt turns out that's not particularly strange or even unusual. Bannister says this rock is likely filled with the kinds of things that comets and asteroids generally have in abundance. Carbon monoxide, for instance or cyanide. If so, when they get close to the sun and get warm, these gases shoot out like jets in a process called sublimation. This is likely what made Oumuamua look like it was acting under its own power, because it was in a way.\n\nHere's how NASA explains this outgassing acceleration:\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nWe'll never really know\n\nBut that perfectly reasonable explanation didn't stop Harvard scientists Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from putting forth a few possible alternate possibilities for Oumuamua, including one that suggests our interstellar space rock was a lightsail, a giant sail that uses energy from the sun instead of wind to push a vehicle through space.\n\nThey suggest this might be a possibility because some other studies suggest our interstellar wanderer isn't a comet and isn't doing any outgassing. Hence the solar sail idea. And the team does the math to show how Oumuamua might fit the bill.\n\nThe other possibility put forward by Bialy and Loeb is that \"Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\" They do the math here as well to show how Oumuamua's trajectory might make sense if it was aimed our way.\n\nIt's important to note that the paper hasn't been peer reviewed yet, which is the process all scientific research goes through before it gets published by reputable journals like Science, or Nature. That means other scientists in the same field read it over, give input and check on its validity. So we'll see what happens with this paper.\n\nBut as far as Oumuamua goes, it's too small for even our best telescopes to get a look at, so researchers have all the information they'll ever have.\n\nBut don't worry, there are likely a lot more Oumuamua's out there. \u201cThe galaxy is filled with flying rocks,\u201d Bannister says. \"Trillions upon trillions\" of space rocks, ranging in size from a \"skyscraper\" to a planet, are likely roaming around the galaxy. And if we're lucky, Bannister says we should be able to see about one a year.\n\nSo, in a way the Earth is getting visitors from other stars, but they're just random rocks passing through. So, no aliens, but still pretty really great science."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Experts Turn Old Coal Mines into Carbon-Sucking Forests", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-turn-old-coal-mines-into-carbon-sucking-forests/4649566.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:11", "body_paragraphs": "Dramatic steps are needed to avoid potentially catastrophic levels of global warming, says the latest report from the U.N.

It can cause chronic pain, menstrual problems, recurrent urinary tract infections, cysts and infertility. Some girls hemorrhage to death or die from infections. It can also cause fatal childbirth complications in later life.\n\nAnalyzing data spanning more than 20 years, BMJ Global Health said in a study there was a \"huge and significant decline\" in FGM in children under 14 across Africa.\n\nEast Africa had the biggest fall in its prevalence rates, dropping to 8 percent in 2016 from 71 percent in 1995, according to the BMJ study published Tuesday.\n\nIn north Africa, prevalence rates fell to 14 percent in 2015 from nearly 60 percent in 1990, the report said; west Africa dropped to about 25 percent in 2017, from 74 percent in 1996.\n\nUNICEF, the U.N. children\u2019s agency, estimates that 200 million women and girls globally have undergone FGM, with the highest prevalence in Africa and parts of the Middle East.\n\nMore to the story\n\nCampaigners welcomed the drop but said FGM also affects teenagers and young women, demographic groups outside the study.\n\n\"We are pleased to see that the numbers are coming down in a lot of countries,\" said Emma Lightowlers, a spokeswoman for campaign group 28TooMany, which does research on FGM in Africa. \"But it doesn't tell the whole story and there are other groups where cutting takes place after the age of 14.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

Perpetrators historically rarely faced more than a fine, experts say, but can now be sentenced to up to five years in prison thanks to a law that took effect in September.\n\nThe Sexual Harassment Law was passed earlier this year amid an uproar over the arrest and swift release of a man who ejaculated on a fellow bus passenger. The crime was considered a misdemeanor.\n\nThis classification gave perpetrators a sense of impunity and showed a lack of regard for violence against women, said Silvia Chakian, a S\u00e3o Paulo prosecutor who focuses on crimes against women.\n\n\u201cThese cases used to be left in a legislative gap,\u201d Chakian said. \u201cIt was difficult to find a legal framing between \u2018insult to decency,\u2019 which is a misdemeanor with an insignificant penalty, and the crime of rape, which is a more serious crime with prison terms of six to 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe new law defines sexual harassment as a lewd act against someone without their consent that is committed by someone \u201cto satisfy their own lust or that of a third person.\u201d It carries a penalty of one to five years in prison.\n\nBetween Sept. 25, when the law took effect, and Oct. 23, 36 incidents of sexual harassment were reported on buses, trains and subways in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area alone, according to a HuffPost Brazil analysis of transit authority data.\n\nDespite the problem\u2019s persistence, the law is widely seen as a crucial step toward curbing harassment of women in public spaces.\n\nReporting Harassment\n\nThe first arrest for sexual harassment on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s public transit system was made the day after the law took effect.\n\nA woman reported that a man sat next to her on a train and ran his hand over her legs. She got off the train at the next station and reported the incident to security officials, who found the suspect and brought him to police. After an initial hearing, the man was released pending the outcome of his trial, but he is required to check in with authorities each month until the case goes to court, according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State Court of Justice.\n\nThe incident was one of 13 cases of sexual harassment reported between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23 on S\u00e3o Paulo trains, according to transit authority data. Six other cases were reported on metro area buses. Seventeen incidents were reported on the city\u2019s subways, and subway officials say 13 of those resulted in arrests.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS This file photo from 2013 shows passengers riding escalators to access subway platforms in Sao Paulo.\n\nThe three companies that manage public transportation in the greater S\u00e3o Paulo area advise victims of sexual harassment to immediately seek help from transit employees \u2014 bus drivers or security officials at train and subway stations \u2014 and to identify perpetrators, if possible. Representatives from the companies said they had trained their employees to help these women and have been intensifying campaigns to combat harassment.\n\nMetr\u00f4, the city\u2019s subway authority, allows users to report incidents and send photos and videos to authorities via a mobile app or SMS service. The city\u2019s train authority allows also allows victims to report harassment anonymously through its own SMS service.\n\nUsed Condoms In Bags\n\nBut the reporting system hasn\u2019t been effective for everyone. Clara Novais, a 27-year-old journalist, told HuffPost Brazil that she couldn\u2019t find any subway authority to help her after a man put a used condom in her bag.\n\n\u201cI felt a liquid dripping on me and thought it might be my lunch that was leaking out of my backpack, but when I stopped to look closely, it was actually a used condom,\u201d she said. \u201cI had seen other freaky sexual cases on the subway, and my first reaction was to think, \u2018I do not believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d The alleged incident happened on a train on Oct. 2,10 days after the law took effect.\n\nNovais said she could not find an employee to help her once she got off the train. \u201cI complained on the [train authority] website and published [my account] on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cSo before going to the police station, I was interviewed by some media outlets and went to make the police report at night.\u201d\n\nOther stories began to emerge after Novais went public.\n\nRebecca Barboza, a 25-year-old designer, told HuffPost Brazil she found a condom on her belongings on the same day as Novais.\n\n\u201cIt happened on my birthday. I was already leaving the subway, on the escalator, and was distracted answering texts when I felt something cold on my back,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran my hand over it and smelled something terrible. When I took the backpack off, I saw the condom.\u201d\n\nBarboza went to a bathroom to wash her clothes and said another woman noticed she was visibly shaken. The woman brought Barboza to transit authority staff, who advised her to file a police report at a station inside the terminal.\n\nAuthorities there refused to label the offense as sexual harassment, Barboza said, and instead classified it as a misdemeanor \u201cinsult to decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the time I arrived, I said it was sexual harassment, and the official said it was not,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked why, and he said there was no physical contact.\u201d\n\nI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment. ... We will have to wait to see how the judiciary will deal with it \u2014 what they will and won\u2019t view as sexual harassment. Ana Paula Braga, a lawyer with the Feminist Network of Jurists\n\nAna Paula Braga, a lawyer with the Feminist Network of Jurists, said she thought both cases could meet the requirements of harassment under the new law, since condoms have a clear sexual purpose.\n\n\u201cI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment,\u201d Braga said. \u201cWhat jurists have been discussing is how the courts will judge this lewd act in practice. We will have to wait to see how the judiciary will deal with it \u2014 what they will and won\u2019t view as sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nPaula Machado Souza, a women\u2019s rights specialist at S\u00e3o Paulo Public Defender\u2019s Office, sees other potential problems with the wide scope of the legislation. \u201cSome cases of rape are being reclassified as sexual harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the end, judges will decide the scope of this regulation. And we come from a judiciary system that still needs to learn to deal with gender issues, to understand what gender violence, sexual violence, and lewd acts are. The law has not yet comprehended these concepts and replicates the chauvinist and patriarchal culture.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the two condom cases, Chakian said it was impossible to say if they can be framed under the new criminal classification, adding that each would have to be carefully assessed.\n\nIn response to inquiries about the classification of both condom incidents, the Civil Police said that each case \u201cis classified based on the report given by the victim at the time of registration and may be changed during the investigations, without prejudice to the accountability of harassers.\u201d Both cases are currently under investigation."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Ryanair Sacks Cabin Crew For Allegedly Faking Photo Of Sleeping On Airport Floor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryanair-cabin-crew-sleeping-airport-fired_us_5be3d415e4b0dbe871a6d726", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:18", "body_paragraphs": "Ryanair has sacked six cabin crew members who were photographed sleeping on the floor of a Spanish airport last month due to flight disruptions.\n\nThe low-cost Irish airline alleges that the image, which has been widely circulated on social media, is a \u201cfake\u201d and the staff had subsequently been dismissed for gross misconduct on Monday.\n\nFirst shared on Twitter by Jim Atkinson, the image purported to show crew members based in Portugal forced to sleep on the floor after flights to the city of Porto were disrupted \u201cdue to storms.\u201d\n\nThis is a Ryanair 737 crew based in Portugal, stranded in Malaga, Spain a couple of nights ago due to storms.

In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \u201cEinsatzgruppen.\u201d\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "After Teen\u2019s Suicide, Family Says Police Mishandled Her Rape Investigation", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/louisiana-family-says-police-mishandled-teen-rape-investigation_us_5be5fe70e4b0e8438897ca0a", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:18", "body_paragraphs": "ST.

He was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. Because of the terms of his plea, he can have his conviction expunged after he completes his probation.\n\nTimothy Phares Jr. said he blames the St. Tammany Sheriff\u2019s Office for failing to get justice for his daughter.\n\n\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office handled the case very poorly and failed to provide the DA\u2019s office with sufficient information,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cBut for the help of District Attorney Warren Montgomery, [Cowell] wouldn\u2019t even have been in a courtroom.\u201d\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement emailed to HuffPost, St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Randy Smith defended the handling of the case.\n\n\u201cThere was insufficient evidence to support a rape charge against Mr. Cowell,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere was in fact significant evidence that the sexual encounter between Ms. Phares and Mr. Cowell was consensual, including surveillance video and statements of witnesses at the scene that evening.\u201d\n\nAccording to an investigative report by The New Orleans Advocate and WWL-TV, Amelia Phares told sheriff\u2019s deputies she was raped on May 22, 2016, after climbing into a truck belonging to a friend of a friend.\n\n\u201cWhen I tried to leave, he pushed me back and he raped me,\u201d the teenager said during a rape exam at Children\u2019s Hospital in New Orleans, according to notes on her medical records, which her parents provided to the news outlets.\n\nTimothy Phares said that in the months that followed, authorities \u201cdidn\u2019t follow up at all with the family.\u201d\n\nIn the interim, Amelia Phares struggled emotionally and started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist, her father said. He added that she was bullied at school was harassed on social media, and was distraught about not only the alleged incident but also her belief that authorities were not going to do anything about it.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t like to talk about it and spent most of her time trying to pretend it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2016, Amelia Phares died after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Before that, she recorded a short video for her family.\n\n\u201cIt was just a goodbye letter to the family in video form,\u201d Timothy Phares said of the video.\n\nJustice for Amelia Phares Amelia Phares, 16, killed herself a few months after reporting a rape to police.\n\nIn October 2017, nearly a year after his daughter\u2019s death \u2014 investigators told the family they were still waiting to receive a report on the DNA evidence, Timothy Phares said.\n\nHe added that investigators on two occasions said the district attorney\u2019s office closed the case but that when contacted by the family, the district attorney\u2019s office said it had yet to receive the case.\n\nIn February 2018, nearly two years after the rape was reported, the sheriff\u2019s office issued Cowell a misdemeanor summons for carnal knowledge of a juvenile.\n\nDuring the court proceeding, Timothy Phares said his daughter might still be alive if swift action had been taken.\n\n\u201cIf she had seen that the justice system was working for her to help her rather than help him or protect her rather than protect him, then she would\u2019ve fought this battle all the way to its end,\u201d he said.\n\nThat protection, Timothy Phares told HuffPost, was extended to Cowell even after the sentencing.\n\n\u201cThe guy who pled guilty and will serve no time in jail got a police escort to his car afterward, and the family of victim was basically told to go away,\u201d Phares said.\n\nHe alleged that officials at the sheriff\u2019s office have refused to take a complaint about the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe internal affairs division refused it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then tried the Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s Office, and they said it was not within their jurisdiction. We tried speaking with the FBI, who said they could not help us either.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff did not comment on any attempts to file a complaint, but he did say the district attorney\u2019s office was in agreement with the police on the handling of the case.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have great sympathy for the Phares family, my first duty as sheriff is [to] see that individuals are charged only with those crimes that are supported by the evidence, and that is what occurred in this case,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe family recently created a Justice for Amelia Phares page on Facebook in an effort to raise awareness about the case.\n\n\u201cWe believe that women in St. Tammany Parish are not safe,\u201d Timothy Phares said. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office has basically decided that they are second-class citizens.

The statue begins to teeter toward the ground, but an artist involved with her creation, Tom Molloy, grabs the statue and stabilizes her before the crash. Molloy knows he won\u2019t be able to save this piece of art for long, though.\n\nThe statue must survive until Friday\u2019s opening day of the new \u201cFriends\u201d pop-up at Replay in Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park neighborhood, but the artists fully understand the ephemeral quality of all their hard work.\n\n\u201cThis bar has been beat up,\u201d Molloy said. \u201cPeople come in here and are reckless. That\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ve had to get over quickly, is that people will come in here and just destroy everything if they get the chance. All this nice stuff you see right now, like this furniture and the little things \u2015 the vases and the flowers \u2015 they\u2019ll be gone in a few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago-based artists behind the installation \u2015 known as the Pop Up Squad \u2015 have quickly become pros of this niche art form. The group has collaborated with Replay since October 2017, when the bar hosted a pop-up based on \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Since then, the bar has had runs of various pop culture pop-ups, including \u201cSouth Park,\u201d \u201cRick & Morty,\u201d \u201cThe Office\u201d and the video game \u201cFortnite.\u201d\n\nDespite the art\u2019s inevitable doom, the squad clearly put a ton of work into this new \u201cFriends\u201d pop-up. Artists were still working on final touches as I browsed the new setup, but I could see highlights, like multiple apartment re-creations (one with custom flooring), a re-creation of the famous dog statue that the characters Joey and Chandler owned in the show and, of course, the Monica-with-turkey-head statue.\n\nTodd Van Luling/HuffPost Monica wearing a turkey on her head, from \"The One With All the Thanksgivings\" episode in 1998, inspired a statue in the Lincoln Park bar.\n\nThe pop-up will last until Nov. 25 \u2015 barring legal troubles.\n\nEmporium, another Chicago arcade bar that occasionally does pop culture pop-ups, got a jokey cease-and-desist from Netflix when the bar had a \u201cStranger Things\u201d project in 2017. Replay has since taken the torch from Emporium as the go-to place for pop culture pop-ups in the city but has similarly had many conversations with lawyers.\n\n\u201cI just played dumb,\u201d Replay owner Mark Kwiatkowski said of the expected moment lawyers reached out during an \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d pop-up. Kwiatkowski very much seems to still have a \u201chope for the best and ask for forgiveness later\u201d attitude when it comes to these events.\n\nBut through persistence, Replay has started getting on the good side of production companies\u2019 marketing teams. Over the last year, Replay has actually collaborated with the rights owners in getting the projects to the finish line. Fingers remain crossed that happens for the \u201cFriends\u201d installation.\n\nTodd Van Luling/HuffPost A re-creation of Chandler and Joey's \"Friends\" apartment.\n\nOver the next couple of weeks, Replay will host \u201cFriends\u201d-themed events, including a foosball tournament and a trivia night focused on the show. A Phoebe-esque singer-songwriter also might make an appearance.\n\nThe Pop Up Squad artists worked on custom artwork to accompany the installation. For now, you\u2019ll have to attend the event to purchase their related art, but the group is already branching out to create more pop culture-based events around Chicago. Another Squad member, Adam Michaels, told me he plans to host a Harry Potter and Christmas-themed art show called \u201cA Very Harry Christmas.\u201d That will take place Dec. 10 and 11 on the third floor at 1821 W. Hubbard Lofts. Molloy and another Squad member I spoke to, Luis Colindres, seemed to be helping out with the project, too. (The Pop Up Squad artists also include Jeremy Steffen, Raquel Hung and Tristan Young.)\n\n\u201cThe pop-ups are a cool way for people to come and get a little curated selection of Chicago artists,\u201d Molloy said, which started a back-and-forth between him and Michaels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to be in this position, being here at Replay,\u201d Michaels said.\n\n\u2033[Mark] has provided us with a lot of space to do a lot of really cool stuff,\u201d Molloy said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a yes man, which is hard with a lot of bosses. We have a lot of ideas. Obviously, we\u2019re creative people. We\u2019re going to have a ton of ideas, and he\u2019s, like, as long as we can make it sound like it\u2019s a solid plan, he\u2019s always down to do it, and that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nThe camaraderie among everyone involved was evident at Replay. And I imagine that has allowed for this space to become the sort of standard-bearer for these pop culture projects. If the crew didn\u2019t enjoy working with each other, they wouldn\u2019t keep throwing themselves into these multi-week, sleepless-night projects that can get shut down by lawyers at any minute.\n\nReplay has a unique situation at the moment, and you should check it out while this nostalgic renaissance still exists. And, I mean, drinking a beer while marveling at a statue of Monica with a turkey on her head should be a no-brainer, right?\n\nHere are a few more photos of the \u201cFriends\u201d pop-up:\n\nTodd Van Luling/HuffPost The photo-op spot designed to look like the opening credits.\n\nTodd Van Luling/HuffPost A close-up on the pop-up's re-creation of the famous apartment door.\n\nTodd Van Luling/HuffPost A few \"Friends\"-themed drinks."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Slams Fox News For Laughing At Her DC Rent Problem", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-fox-news-dc-rent_us_5be5e0dee4b0e8438897893b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:20", "body_paragraphs": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who this week became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, called out Fox News for belittling her struggle to afford an apartment in Washington, D.C., during a Friday panel discussion on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d\n\nThe Fox panelists snickered all the way through their chat on the topic, described in a chyron as: \u201cSelf-proclaimed socialist says she can\u2019t afford DC rent.\u201d\n\nContributor Judy Miller actually laughed after host Bill Hemmer recalled that Ocasio-Cortez \u2015 whose name no one pronounced correctly on the show \u2015 was working in the service industry before she launched into her campaign to represent New York\u2019s 14th District.\n\n\u201cIt is bizarre to see 1%-salaried anchors laugh at the US housing crisis,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, 29, tweeted in response.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to be ashamed or embarrassed,\u201d she said in another tweet.\n\nShe added: \u201cAs much as Fox News likes to mock the working class, the real scandal is that at the wealthiest point in our history, we are at one of our most unequal.\u201d\n\n1. @FoxNews, why can\u2019t any of your anchors say my name correctly?

But nothing is normal about Georgia\u2019s race for governor.\n\nAbrams, who would be the first black female governor in the history of the nation, had to devote an enormous amount of energy during her campaign to fighting the voter suppression tactics of her opponent, who refused to resign his position as secretary of state to run for governor and therefore oversaw his own election. Kemp now holds 50.33 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019 48.72, and a candidate in Georgia has to win at least 50 percent to win the race outright.\n\nAbrams maintains that the hundreds of thousands of people Kemp allegedly blocked from the polls could easily push her to victory, or at least a runoff.\n\nThere were numerous accounts of voting difficulties in Georgia on Tuesday \u2015 particularly for people of color. Voters were denied a ballot and turned away from the polls because they hadn\u2019t voted in the last three years and/or the last two federal elections, and Kemp\u2019s office had purged hundreds of thousands of people from the rolls for \u201cinactivity.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Kemp\u2019s office put 53,000 voter registration applications on hold \u2015 70 percent of them from people of color \u2015 because of the state\u2019s controversial \u201cexact match\u201d law.\n\nVoters in Gwinnett County, a diverse swing district north of Atlanta where Abrams canvassers had focused their turnout efforts, were forced to wait hours in line because the voting machines lacked power cords and ran out of batteries.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign held a press conference Friday with Georgia voters who said they were blocked from the polls for various reasons. One person said she never received the absentee ballot she requested, despite calling the voter hotline for help. Another said she was turned away from her polling place, despite being registered to vote there, because they wouldn\u2019t accept her valid out-of-state ID. Others said they were forced to go to second and sometimes third polling places because theirs were experiencing technical difficulties.\n\nThe Abrams campaign also charges that tens of thousands of outstanding ballots have not been counted \u2015 particularly provisional and absentee ballots. Abrams staffers have been spending \u201cevery hour of every day\u201d on the phone with voters, coaching them through how they can make sure their votes have been counted, campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said Friday. The campaign is also pursuing legal action to ensure all votes are counted.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating multiple cases from students who believe they timely and properly submitted their absentee ballots but when they checked the Secretary of State\u2019s website, it appears those ballots have not yet been accepted,\u201d the campaign said in a press release Thursday night.\n\nKemp, meanwhile, has vehemently denied any allegations of voter suppression.

Whitaker also later served as the chairman of a Clovis campaign for state treasurer.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Clovis said Whitaker is \u201ca wonderful man\u201d and \u201ca dear friend.\u201d He added that Whitaker was a \u201csounding board\u201d for him when Clovis worked for Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWalter Shaub, who was director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics for four years before resigning in July 2017, said the friendship between Whitaker and Clovis should disqualify Whitaker from supervising the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cWhitaker has to recuse himself under DOJ\u2019s regulation requiring recusal if you have a personal or political relationship with someone substantially involved in conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution,\u201d Shaub told Reuters.\n\nDepartment of Justice spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment.\n\n\n\nA DOJ regulation cited by Shaub states that employees \u201cmay not supervise prosecutions or investigations that involve someone with a personal or political relationship.\u201d\n\nIt says the possible conflict can be set aside if the employee\u2019s supervisor judges that the relationship does not affect the official\u2019s impartiality or create the public perception of a conflict.\n\nTrevor Potter, a former Republican commissioner on the Federal Election Commission who now leads the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for more transparency in elections, said the question of whether Whitaker should recuse himself depends on Clovis\u2019 status in the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cIf he has a close personal friendship with someone who is involved in the investigation because of his role in the Trump campaign, then that would present a recusal issue,\u201d Potter said.\n\nMueller has not publicly identified any of the targets of his investigation.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig, a fellow at the non-partisan R Street Institute which specializes in public policy, said he believed Whitaker\u2019s friendship with Clovis is \u201cprobably not a problem\u201d but that Whitaker should ask the DOJ\u2019s Professional Responsibility and Accountability Office whether he has a conflict.\n\nWhile he still led the government ethics office, Shaub last year advised the Justice Department to require Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Mueller probe because Sessions had been a senior adviser to Trump during the election campaign.\n\nSessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself infuriated Trump. After months of publicly criticizing his attorney general, Trump asked him to resign on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s selection by Trump as acting attorney general drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who described it as an attempt by the president to undermine and possibly end Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nMueller\u2019s team has netted convictions and guilty pleas from several Trump campaign staff members and advisers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, and describes Mueller\u2019s investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nMoscow has denied U.S. security agencies\u2019 allegations that it interfered in the election in a bid to help Trump.\n\nA former U.S. attorney and conservative commentator, Whitaker last year wrote an opinion piece for CNN arguing that Mueller would be going too far if he investigated the Trump family\u2019s finances."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Attacks Journalists, Claims 'No One Manipulated' Jim Acosta Video", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-acosta-video-trump-white-house_us_5be5a111e4b0dbe871aa40a7", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:21", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump on Friday resumed his attacks on journalists, calling one a \u201closer,\u201d accusing another of asking a \u201cstupid question\u201d and defending a video shared by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders that appeared to have been doctored to cast CNN reporter Jim Acosta in a negative light.\n\nSanders circulated the video Wednesday night after the White House announced it had revoked Acosta\u2019s press credentials following a contentious press conference with the president.\n\n\u201cNo one manipulated it, give me a break,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House.\n\nSanders claimed the video proves Acosta became aggressive with a White House intern attempting to take a microphone from him.

If the signature on the voter registration doesn\u2019t match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \u201ccure\u201d it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nMany other counties only allow voters to cure until polls close on Election Day.\n\nOnly a few thousand votes would be affected by the suit, but every one counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally. On Thursday, Sinema jumped into a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. Her lead came from the two counties singled out by Republicans in their lawsuit, Maricopa and Pima Counties.\n\nThe race remained too close to call with at least 400,000 ballots still uncounted. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said counting may continue until Nov. 15. \u201cWe know there\u2019s urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Each of those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.\n\nIf the signature on the envelope does not match the signature on the voter file, elections officials can contact the voter to try to resolve the discrepancy. Such situations arise, for example, when voters have Parkinson\u2019s disease and can no longer sign as they did in the past or as their signature changes over the years.\n\nThe GOP lawsuit centers on that \u201ccure\u201d process. It asks that the judge either stop Maricopa and Pima from contacting voters to fix their ballots after Election Day or permit the rest of the state to do it. At least two other rural counties also allow post-Election Day \u201ccures\u201d but several others do not.\n\nDemocrats contended that the GOP is trying to prevent votes from being counted. \u201cThe Republican Party is doing everything it can to silence thousands of Arizonans who already cast their ballots,\u201d Democratic Party chairwoman Felicia Rotellini said in a statement.\n\nGOP attorney Brett Johnson said in an interview the party would be happy if the end result is the rural counties are ordered to extend their cure period and more votes are counted. \u201cAt the end of the day, each vote should be treated the same way,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe state\u2019s junior Republican Senator, Jon Kyl, issued a statement trying to frame the lawsuit as a question of equal protection rather than limiting urban vote counting. \u201cEvery single lawful vote in Arizona should be counted,\u201d Kyl said. \u201cAnd voting laws in our state should be applied uniformly across the map.\u201d\n\nAt a brief hearing Thursday, a Maricopa County official said only about 5,600 ballots are at issue in her county and the rate is similar in the 14 smaller counties. More than 2.2 million votes were cast statewide.\n\nThere were more than 600,000 mail-in ballots left to process statewide as of Wednesday, about 75 percent in Maricopa County. That huge amount has put pressure on a system that spends a lot of time already verifying the mail ballot signatures.\n\nFontes said his office\u2019s 1980s-era computer system is partly to blame. It was put in when Maricopa was far smaller and only a handful of its residents voted by mail.\n\nHe said the system only allows his office to tally about 75,000 votes a day. There are another 375,000 votes outstanding in Maricopa County alone as of Thursday night.\n\nThe two Senate campaigns have long braced for a slow vote count. McSally is no stranger to the issue. It took The Associated Press 12 days to declare a winner in McSally\u2019s first race for Congress, which she narrowly lost in 2012.\n\nOn Thursday, she tweeted: \u201cWoke up this morning dreading a long and painful process.

They would be the first humans on the list, which classifies endangered, threatened and vulnerable animal species around the globe.\n\nA video from the advocacy group (see above) makes its point in part by dressing individuals with Down syndrome in costumes resembling such endangered, threatened and vulnerable species as polar bears, lions and rhinos.\n\nThe campaign is a reaction to the fact that genetic screening has led to a significant decrease in people born with Down syndrome.\n\nSince the prenatal tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, for example, almost 100 percent of women who received a positive test for Down syndrome opted for an abortion, according to CBS. As a result, the condition has been almost completely disappeared from Iceland\u2019s younger population.\n\nSome people may believe that eradicating the condition is a good thing. But advocates argue that this kind of attitude contributes to a stigma that people with Down Syndrome are lesser humans. And that kind of thinking impacts societal awareness, funding and job opportunities for those who have Down syndrome and desperately need aid \u2014 hence the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s underfunded support programs for education, higher rates of unemployment, extended waitlists for appropriate housing, or even just negative public perception and stigma, the challenges faced by people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t decreasing \u2014 they\u2019re increasing,\u201d Laura LaChance, the board chair for the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, said in a press release.\n\nThe group told HuffPost Canada that by pushing to add people with Down syndrome to the endangered species list, it\u2019s advocating for the same kinds of \u201cfunding, protections, government intervention and public awareness that species on the Endangered List receive.\u201d\n\nMany people still found the campaign\u2019s comparison of humans to animals dehumanizing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine folks with Down Syndrome would want to be considered a separate species.

Because we don\u2019t talk about it. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nAfter that miscarriage, she and her husband went on to conceive their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, through in vitro fertilization \u2015 a medical procedure in which eggs are extracted from a woman\u2019s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory to create embryos. If viable embryos are created, they are transferred back into the woman\u2019s body to establish a pregnancy.\n\nObama hinted in the ABC interview that the couple turned to IVF due to an issue with egg quality.\n\n\u201cThe biological clock is real because egg production is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized that as I was 34 and 35 \u2015 we had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for people facing infertility problems say that the revelation from one of the most admired women in America will help others feel less alone.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of the education and advocacy organization Fertility for Colored Girls, said that Obama\u2019s disclosure could give hope to other women of color who may be struggling alone with their infertility.\n\n\u201cSo many black women [and] couples live in silence and shame for so many reasons, including myths and misconceptions about black women being hyper-fertile,\u201d Edwards-Dunn said. \u201c[Michelle Obama] just gave so many women permission to exhale and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alone, and I too can get support and help to become a parent!\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s story will open up more conversations about infertility and black women, said Edwards-Dunn, who has gone through seven IVF cycles herself and now has a 4-year-old child conceived from the treatments.\n\n\u201cNot only is this the first time that we hear of a first lady being so transparent about her personal fertility challenges, but her courageous truth-telling gives more women, particularly black women and couples, the courage to talk about their own challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aaron Styer, an African-American reproductive endocrinologist and founding partner of the fertility clinic CCRM Boston, said this could encourage more couples to visit a doctor.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most respected and revered women of color, Michelle Obama\u2019s openness to discuss her IVF treatments will open that dialogue and empower black women and all women, men, and couples facing infertility to seek these treatments to conceive,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of the infertility advocacy group RESOLVE, similarly hopes that Obama\u2019s news might inspire others to act.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day impact really happens when people who care about this issue talk to their employers about adding family building benefits to help them, when they talk to their lawmakers about policy change, and when we as a community make sure that anyone struggling to build a family has access to information and support,\u201d said Collura.\n\nInfertility can strike all races, ethnicities and economic groups. Overall, about 12 percent of women in the U.S. have problems either getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.\n\nBut black women have higher rates of infertility (defined as unprotected sex with a man for more than one year without a pregnancy) and higher rates of pregnancy loss between 10 and 20 weeks gestation. The cause may be a complex mix of medical issues including higher rates of fibroids, obesity, and blocked fallopian tubes \u2015 all factors that can affect fertility, said Styer.\n\nBlack women are also less likely than other groups to seek medical help for infertility. A 2015 study surveying 300 reproductive-age women with infertility found that black women were less likely to visit a doctor for help getting pregnant and that they waited twice as long as white women before seeking help.\n\nResearchers say this is the result of both cultural and practical barriers to medical care. There is some evidence that black women in particular feel they can\u2019t reach out for support and experience shame about their condition because of the expectation (and stigma) that black women are especially fertile.\n\nBut the most significant problem may be rooted in more practical concerns: Black women trying to get infertility treatment say it\u2019s more difficult for them to get doctor\u2019s appointments, take time off from work and pay for treatment.\n\nIVF is a common medical treatment, and more than one million babies have been born in the U.S. thanks to the technology. But most people who have fertility issues will never be able to access this or other treatments. Among women interviewed for the 2006\u20132010 National Survey of Family Growth, only 3.1 percent of those with fertility issues had ever used assisted reproductive technology like IVF.\n\nThis could be because the average couple going through IVF will spend more than $24,000 in an 18-month period. And this is likely to be an out-of-pocket cost, as infertility treatment is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nEven when black women are able to seek help, the best treatments that medical science has for infertility don\u2019t seem to work as well with them. A study of about 4,000 women undergoing their first IVF cycle found that black women had lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and a live birth compared to white women, along with higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nStill, fingers are crossed that Obama\u2019s disclosure will at least drive more women of color to consult with fertility clinics \u2015 just as Angelina Jolie\u2019s 2013 New York Times op-ed caused a spike in genetic testing for breast cancer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "The FDA Just Approved An Opioid 10 Times More Powerful Than Fentanyl", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fda-opioid-approval-dsuviafentanyl_us_5be58e8ce4b0dbe871aa19e5", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:22", "body_paragraphs": "The Food and Drug Administration approved a controversial new opioid formulation this month, even as critics warned that it would likely be abused.\n\nThe drug, called Dsuvia, is a synthetic opioid that\u2019s 10 times more powerful than fentanyl, the potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the 72,000 drug overdose deaths the United States logged in 2017.\n\nThe newly approved formulation of Dsuvia is a tablet version that goes under the tongue.

According to my family, I had enough hearing to adapt to the hearing world and attend mainstream school. I struggled through school, not only to hear my teachers \u2015 some of whom begged for my parents to get me hearing aids \u2015 but also to hear my classmates. I felt isolated and disconnected from people most of the time, even though my mother is deaf and the Deaf world was part of my life. I experienced the jokes, bullying and rejections of growing up hard of hearing in a world where everyone can hear.\n\nYet I did learn how to adapt to the hearing world. I learned to read lips, decipher body language, and find patterns in daily activities to predict conversations. (People are predictable.) I even use reading to learn new words so it will be easier for me to grasp words within conversations. I\u2019m grateful that I understand at least 85 percent of most conversations around me. I can glide around mainstream culture and act as if I have normal hearing even if I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids.\n\nIf I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids, I pretend I can hear everything when I really don\u2019t, just to be part of the hearing world. The truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on. On most days, that works.\n\nI use my phone flash for notifications and captions to watch TV. I ask people to repeat themselves, and I can\u2019t follow a group conversation in a noisy restaurant. I can\u2019t walk and listen at the same time. I need to see a person\u2019s face to get the full conversation. I have to strain to hear certain voices \u2015 like children\u2019s \u2015 even if I have hearing aids. The aftermath is that I get exhausted more easily. Then I avoid these necessary social interactions, even if I want to be a part of them. These challenges leave me feeling isolated, lonely and fatigued.\n\nThe truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I fit into the hearing world. But I don\u2019t fit into the Deaf world either.\n\nMy mom gave me an inherited connection to the Deaf world. She is immersed in the Deaf culture \u2015 a vibrant, talented beautiful community. Profoundly deaf in one ear since birth, my mother attended schools for Deaf children and uses interpreters to communicate with the hearing world. Her experiences provide her with a sense of belonging to the Deaf world, but they also come with constant discrimination from the hearing world.\n\nThere are some differences that create a disconnection between me and the Deaf world. As a CODA \u2015 child of a deaf adult \u2015 when I\u2019m with Deaf friends, my default role becomes that of an unofficial interpreter. I become the assigned interpreter of the group because I have enough hearing to carry a conversation with a hearing person. I remember having to interpret for my mother as a child. I was forced to interpret for her at doctor\u2019s appointments, government offices and everywhere else. Most times, I\u2019d have to miss school to attend these appointments with her.\n\nWhile the ADA law states that an interpreter must be provided to a Deaf person, the reality is that more often than not, an interpreter is not offered. So I interpret for her, but having moderate hearing loss affects my ability to interpret. I always feel anxious; I have to listen to all the verbal and non-verbal cues of the speaker, process the message, and translate to American Sign Language (ASL) \u2015 all while delivering the message simultaneously to the Deaf person. This is a much more involved and complicated process that I have not fully mastered even after years of practice.\n\nMy hearing usually leaves me uncertain of the message and stressed about the implication of delivering it incorrectly. Basically, I am terrified of getting it wrong. If I\u2019m interpreting for a friend at a doctor\u2019s office, misunderstanding how many pills she has to take can result in an overdose. Many times, a person can fully hear the message someone else is trying to communicate but doesn\u2019t understand it. This added stress makes me shy away from Deaf friends. I feel guilty because I want to relax with friends without the pressure of interpreting.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture.\n\nAnother reason I don\u2019t fit entirely into the Deaf world is that I don\u2019t need to use some of the resources available to that community. I don\u2019t personally use an interpreter to communicate. I don\u2019t need a flashing doorbell or flashing smoke alarms. I don\u2019t need video phones. I learned ASL as a child but I mainly communicate with my voice, speaking English or Spanish to friends and family.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture. In the past, I\u2019ve been discouraged from using my voice and pushed to only communicate in ASL. But using my voice is part of who I am, not a denial of the Deaf culture.\n\nI have a hearing husband and two sons, one whom is hard of hearing. None of them have fully mastered ASL. Learning a language is difficult and requires years of practice. Even if my husband and sons take the time to learn the language, they may never be completely fluent. Thus, we still use our voices at home when we communicate.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the Deaf community has been welcoming to me. I\u2019ve always wanted to feel like I belonged in both the Deaf and hearing worlds, but I don\u2019t fully feel a part of either.\n\nAs I continue my journey, I realize how badly I need more accessibility, compassion and acceptance from the hearing world. I don\u2019t use the same resources other people with hearing loss may request, but I still need certain accommodations. I rely on subtitles, and as a consumer of all media platforms, I still find gaps when I access videos. Video feeds have expanded; the option to caption videos in all platforms should expand as well. This is especially true for live video streams such as Instagram Live. As a creator of Facebook and Instagram videos, I find myself with limited captioning options, so I understand the limitations. Yet it is a necessary feature.\n\nAs noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nFace-to-face conversations are perfect opportunities to show compassion. It\u2019s helpful when people look at me while they speak and don\u2019t get frustrated if I ask them to repeat themselves. It\u2019s hard for me to hear people when they cover their mouths, turn away from me or talk to me from another room. Some people get frustrated when I ask them to repeat themselves, and their first response is to say, \u201cnevermind.\u201d Nevermind sounds to me like \u201cYou are not worth my time.\u201d As noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nAbove all, I would like for people to accept that despite my hearing loss, I can accomplish anything I want. I\u2019m neither lucky nor unlucky. I\u2019m a professional writer, a data analyst, and I\u2019m successful in my life. My hearing loss is not a hindrance. My hearing loss does not determine my intelligence, skills, talent, focus or the lack thereof. I am hard of hearing and I work hard to succeed. I use all the resources I need to make my life work for me. Any hinderance I face comes from the unacceptability of my uniqueness.\n\nI invite the hearing world to embrace our differences so we can learn from each other and create a new world full of opportunities and adventures for everyone."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michelle Obama Reveals She Used IVF To Conceive Her Daughters", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-daughters-ivf_us_5be57e9ae4b0769d24cc3eab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:22", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michelle Obama says she felt \u201clost and alone\u201d after having a miscarriage 20 years ago and underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive her two daughters.\n\n\u201cI felt like I failed because I didn\u2019t know how common miscarriages were because we don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d the former first lady said in an interview broadcast Friday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u2033We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nMrs. Obama, 54, said she and Barack Obama underwent fertilization treatments to conceive daughters Sasha and Malia, now 17 and 20.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: @MichelleObama to @RobinRoberts on suffering a miscarriage 20 years ago: \u201cI felt lost and alone.\u201d More coming up on @GMA and then watch the @ABC special covering her journey to motherhood and more from her memoir, \"Becoming,\" Sunday night 9/8c. https://t.co/LivWLBgeRA pic.twitter.com/gzIe8LTYC2 \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) November 9, 2018\n\n\u201cI realized that as I was 34 and 35,\u201d the famously fit Mrs. Obama said in excerpts from an ABC special set to air Sunday. \u201cWe had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nThe revelations come ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of Mrs. Obama\u2019s memoir \u201cBecoming,\u201d in which she writes openly about everything from growing up in Chicago to confronting racism in public life and becoming the country\u2019s first black first lady.\n\nThe Associated Press purchased an early copy of \u201cBecoming,\u201d one of the most anticipated political books in recent memory.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 01:16:23", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013.

The bill passed over her objections, but she views it as an example of how her values inform her political decisions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to appreciate that these experiences are what compels me to just come in and fix problems,\u201d she said. \u201cIt eliminates my patience for anyone who wants to politicize an issue instead of just rolling up their sleeves and getting to work.\u201d\n\nRepublicans struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms. Whitmer.
